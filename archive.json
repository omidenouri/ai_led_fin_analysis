        "Detailed Analysis of ROE": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is ROE increasing or declining?**  \n  The **ROE** has increased significantly from **-0.0062** in the previous year to **0.0945** in the current year, indicating a notable turnaround in profitability and return to shareholders.\n\n- **Is growth in ROE higher than that of competitors and the industry?**  \n  While specific competitor or industry ROE figures are not provided here, the textual report highlights strong operational improvements and a return to profitability after years of restructuring, suggesting that Tesco's **ROE growth** outpaces many peers in the highly competitive retail sector.\n\n- **Is growth persistent or temporary?**  \n  The growth appears **persistent** rather than temporary, supported by several factors: nine consecutive quarters of sales growth, a 28.4% increase in operating profit before exceptional items, reduction in net debt by nearly 30%, and strategic initiatives such as the merger with Booker expected to unlock further synergies.\n\n# Forecasts:\n- **Expected ROE next year:** Based on the sustained operational improvements, margin expansion targets (3.5%-4.0%), and synergy realization from the Booker merger, the **ROE is expected to improve further, potentially reaching or exceeding 10%** in the next financial year.\n\n# Summary:\n- Tesco has delivered a strong **turnaround**, moving from negative to positive **ROE** in one year, reflecting improved profitability and efficient capital use.  \n- The company's strategic initiatives, including cost reductions of \u00a31.5bn, cash flow growth, and merger synergies, support a **sustainable increase in ROE**.  \n- Risks include ongoing competitive pressures, inflationary cost challenges, and integration costs, but the strong balance sheet and operational momentum mitigate these concerns.  \n- The **return to dividend payments** and investment-grade credit rating ambitions further underscore Tesco's financial health and shareholder value creation.",
        "Detailed Analysis of ROE Drivers": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?**  \n  The company demonstrates a significant improvement in both **Assets Turnover** (from **3.63** to **4.23**) and **Profit Margin** (from a negative **-0.07%** to a positive **1.72%**). This indicates that growth in ROE is driven by increases in both operational efficiency and profitability margins, which is a **very good sign**.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  While the textual report does not provide direct competitor or industry average ratios, Tesco\u2019s improvements in **operating profit** (up 28.4%), **net promoter score**, and **cash flow** suggest the company is outperforming its peers. The positive shift from negative to positive **profit margin** and increased **asset turnover** further implies that Tesco is likely improving above industry averages, a **good sign**.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year:** Given the ongoing restructuring and synergy benefits from the Booker merger, **Asset Turnover** is expected to maintain or slightly improve, forecasted around **4.3 to 4.5**.  \n- **Expected Profit Margin next year:** With continued cost reduction plans and margin improvement ambitions, the **Profit Margin** is forecasted to rise towards **2.0% to 2.5%** by next year.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- Tesco\u2019s **increase in ROE** is driven strongly by both rising **Asset Turnover** (efficiency) and a turnaround in **Profit Margin** from negative to positive, indicating a robust operational improvement.  \n- The company\u2019s focus on cost-cutting, improved supplier relationships, and enhanced product offerings is strengthening margins while asset utilization is becoming more effective.  \n- With its strategic merger with Booker and ongoing cost-saving initiatives, Tesco is well-positioned to continue improving both efficiency and profitability, supporting further ROE growth.",
        "Detailed Analysis of Risk": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Are risks increasing or declining?**  \n  The **NLP financial risk** has increased from **1.05** to **1.16**, and **NLP legal risk** has also risen notably from **0.07** to **0.20**. However, **NLP tax risk** has slightly declined from **0.72** to **0.69**. Overall, the company's risks are **increasing**, especially in financial and legal categories.\n\n- **Is the number and severity of risks higher than competitors/industry?**  \n  Without explicit competitor data, the increase in **financial** and **legal risks** suggests that Tesco may be facing relatively higher or growing risk exposure compared to peers, particularly given the notable rise in legal risk. The company's proactive approach to compliance and governance, as described in the report, may moderate these risks but the increase still signals caution.\n\n- **Is sentiment increasing or declining?**  \n  Sentiment data is indirectly reflected via **NLP sentence length** and **sentence depth** which slightly decreased (sentence length from **28.28** to **27.08**, sentence depth from **6.53** to **6.45**). This suggests a **mild decline in sentiment or cautious tone** in risk disclosures.\n\n- **Is specificity increasing or declining?**  \n  **NLP specificity** has slightly increased from **0.09698** to **0.09717**, indicating a marginal improvement in the **precision and clarity** of risk disclosures.\n\n- **Are complexity measures increasing or declining?**  \n  The slight decrease in both **sentence length** and **sentence depth** indicates a modest decline in complexity, implying that the company may be making risk disclosures more **concise and easier to understand**.\n\n- **How are sentiment, specificity, and complexity compared to competitors?**  \n  Without direct competitor benchmarks, Tesco shows a trend towards **more specific and slightly less complex disclosures** but with a **somewhat cautious or declining sentiment**. This balance suggests an effort to improve transparency while acknowledging increased risks.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Is Gearing expected to increase next year?**  \n  Given the significant reduction in gearing from **4.48** to **2.52**, and the company\u2019s continued focus on debt reduction and balance sheet strengthening, **Gearing is expected to decrease or stabilize, not increase**.\n\n- **Is Current Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The current ratio has slightly declined from **0.79** to **0.71**, but considering the company\u2019s strong cash generation and improved operating profit, it is **likely to improve or stabilize** next year.\n\n- **Is Quick Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The quick ratio declined from **0.37** to **0.27**, reflecting tight liquidity, but with strong cash flows and better working capital management, an **increase or stabilization in quick ratio is expected**.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- Tesco is experiencing an **increase in financial and legal risks**, while tax risk shows slight improvement.  \n- Risk disclosures have become **more specific and less complex**, enhancing transparency, but sentiment around risks has slightly declined, reflecting caution.  \n- Key financial indicators show **positive trends with gearing significantly reduced**, but liquidity ratios have slightly weakened, though are expected to improve given strong cash flow.  \n- The company\u2019s focus on risk management, balance sheet strengthening, and transparency positions it well, despite the increased risk environment.  \n- Overall, Tesco demonstrates **improved financial stability and evolving risk communication**, balancing increased risk exposure with clearer, more user-friendly disclosures.",
        "summary": "- Tesco has achieved a **strong turnaround in ROE**, moving from **-0.62%** to **9.45%**, signaling a significant return to profitability and efficient capital use.  \n- The increase in **ROE is driven by both improved Asset Turnover (4.23) and a positive Profit Margin (1.72%)**, reflecting enhanced operational efficiency and profitability.  \n- Strategic initiatives including the **\u00a31.5bn cost reductions** and the Booker merger are key drivers supporting sustained margin expansion and asset utilization improvements.  \n- Financial risk and legal risk indicators have **increased (NLP financial risk: 1.16, legal risk: 0.20)**, warranting investor attention despite strong risk management efforts.  \n- Liquidity ratios show some pressure with the **Current Ratio at 0.71 and Quick Ratio at 0.27**, but strong cash flow and working capital management are expected to stabilize these.  \n- Gearing has been **significantly reduced from 4.48 to 2.52**, enhancing balance sheet strength and lowering financial vulnerability.  \n- Risk disclosures have become **more specific and less complex**, improving transparency, though sentiment around risks has slightly declined, indicating a cautious outlook.  \n- Tesco\u2019s operational momentum, reflected in **nine consecutive quarters of sales growth** and a 28.4% rise in operating profit, supports confidence in continued performance improvement.  \n- **Expected ROE is projected to exceed 10% next year**, underpinned by ongoing synergy realization and margin expansion targets of 3.5%-4.0%.  \n- Despite competitive and inflationary challenges, Tesco\u2019s balance sheet strength, strategic focus, and return to dividend payments position it well for sustainable shareholder value creation."

We have taken important decisions to help our customers through the year - from reformulating thousands of products to reduce salt, fat and sugar, to launching great value exclusive food brands. Thanks to these efforts, our offer is more competitive, and more customers are shopping at Tesco as a result. At the same time, we are also focused on new opportunities for growth. Most significantly, our merger with Booker allows us to become the UK's leading food business. This report sets out what we have achieved in the year, and gives an update on our medium-term ambitions - our six strategic drivers. We are making strong progress, and firmly believe that by serving shoppers a little better every day, the momentum in our business will continue. Serving shoppers a little better every day. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 2 Introduction 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. Following completion of the merger, I am delighted to welcome two new Directors to the Board: Charles Wilson and Stewart Gilliland. Charles has been appointed to the role of CEO for our retail and wholesale operations in the UK & ROI, while Stewart has joined the Board as a Non-executive Director. Both Charles and Stewart bring substantial levels of experience and expertise, and I know that our business will benefit greatly from their talents. I would also like to take the opportunity here to welcome the very many new shareholders in Tesco, who took up our shares as part of the merger. I look forward to meeting many of you over the coming months, and to hearing your views. Throughout the year, the Board has dedicated significant time to overseeing the merger process, as well as continuing its close involvement in matters of strategy. The Board has also supported the development of our corporate responsibility strategy for the Group, which culminated in the launch of the Little Helps Plan in October 2017. The plan sets out how we will make a positive contribution to our colleagues, customers and communities - as a sustainable business that also takes a lead on issues of societal importance, such as health and tackling food waste. More details on the Little Helps Plan, and the commitments we have made, can be found starting on page 16 of the Strategic report. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to every colleague at Tesco. I firmly believe that the retail industry, and Tesco in particular, have an important role in helping people to develop fulfilling and successful careers. Almost a quarter of our most senior leaders began their careers in stores and, as I travel around our business, I am constantly impressed by the calibre and experience of the colleagues I meet, from a very diverse range of backgrounds. Tesco is a powerful engine of social mobility, and creating opportunities for colleagues to get on in their careers is a focus for us at every level of our business. It is our colleagues' dedication, and relentless focus on doing the right thing for our customers, that has enabled us to build the strong platform we have today. I am confident that the Board and management team have the right plans in place to build from that platform and continue to grow. That will be our collective focus for the coming year, and beyond, as we create long-term value for every stakeholder in our business. John Allan Non-executive Chairman We have made substantial progress this year, as we position our business for new growth. The management team has built solid foundations - and operating profit before exceptional items for the Group is up 28.4% to PS1,644m 2016 17: PS1,280m, with statutory profit before tax of PS1,298m 2016 17: PS145m. This greatly improved performance has also allowed us to make a return to paying dividends, for the first time since 2014. The decision to reinstate the dividend was a particularly important one, and reflects the conviction that the Board and I have in Dave and his team, and the progress we are seeing. So it is from this strong position that we also look ahead to the new opportunities presented by our merger with Booker Group. Shortly after the end of our financial year, and following regulatory and shareholder approval, we completed that merger. Work is already well underway to unlock the substantial synergies that are now available to the combined Group. Bringing together knowledge and skills from across retail and wholesale is both allowing us to trial innovative new concepts and to move faster with existing strategies, for example in rapidly growing the fresh food offer available to Booker's customers.

Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 3 Chairman's statement 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. This has been another significant year for our business. After three years of turnaround, the results we'five shared for this year show that we are firmly on track, and delivering on our commitments. I am pleased with the progress we have made, and excited by the opportunities ahead. We have seen nine consecutive quarters of sales growth in our core UK business, with Group sales up 2.3% for the year. Group operating profit before exceptional items is up 28.4% to PS1,644m 2016 17: PS1,280m, and we are generating more cash - with Retail operating cash flow up 21.7% to PS2.8bn 2016 17: PS2.3bn. We are also making good progress towards the margin ambition we set out in October 2016, with Group operating margin reaching 3.0% in the second half of the year. At the same time, we have strengthened our balance sheet, with Net debt down 29.6% to PS2.6bn 2016 17: PS3.7bn. The external environment remains challenging: consumers are feeling the impact of economic uncertainty, and the pressures I described in last year's Annual Report, such as business rates in the UK and competitive market conditions in Central Europe, have not eased. However, the journey we are on to simplify and grow our business puts us in a strong position to deal with these challenges. By keeping our focus, we are creating value for our customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders. Customers We are helping customers in the areas that matter most to them, and bringing them more sustainable, affordable, healthy food. As a result, our net promoter score has increased by 5 points as more customers recommend Tesco as a place to shop: loyalty is growing, and in the UK 260,000 more shoppers are shopping at Tesco. In the first half of the year, we took a strategic decision to protect our customers and hold back the inflationary pressure we were seeing in the rest of the UK market. We'five also looked at other ways to add value for our customers, with a series of little helps through the year, including: - covering the cost of the 'tampon tax' on women's sanitary products in the UK: - removing barriers to eating healthily with our 'little helps to healthier living' campaign in the UK, and taking 4,100 tonnes of sugar out of our Own Brand soft drinks in Central Europe: - launching our Clubcard app in Thailand, making it easier for customers to manage their points: - passing on an interest rate increase to savers at Tesco Bank, following the Bank of England's base rate rise in November: and - running regular 'Weekly Little Helps' in the UK, helping customers save money on everything from fresh food to fuel. As a business with food at our heart, improving our Own Brand food ranges is a particularly important part of our plans. This year we have relaunched many of these ranges - bringing our customers the best quality products at the very best prices. We have looked at each of the three tiers of our Own Brand offer - 'good', 'better' and 'best' - and are strengthening some brands, like our Tesco core range, and redesigning others, like Tesco finest. Where our customers want the best value, without any compromise on quality, we are adding to our range of entry-level brands that are exclusively available at Tesco. New brands we have launched for Tesco customers include prepared meals, pasta and sauces from the Hearty Food Co. and bakery products from H. W. Nevill's. As part of this work, we have already relaunched 1,300 products in the year, with thousands more to follow - and our brand perception measures of quality and value have both increased. Colleagues The improvements we are making to our business are driven by our colleagues, as they serve our shoppers a little better every day. This year, we announced a 10.5% increase in hourly pay for our UK store colleagues over the next two years, and our Colleague Bonus Plan continues to reward colleagues in the UK for their contribution to our turnaround. ' I'm pleased with the progress we have made, and excited by the opportunities ahead. ' Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive Delivering on our commitments. com ar2018 to hear more from Dave Lewis. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 4 Group Chief Executive's statement 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. indb 4 20 04 2018 15:42 Some of the changes we have made to simplify our business have had a significant impact on colleagues, including the closure of our Customer Engagement Centre in Cardiff, and changes to our operational structures in stores, and I am grateful for the professionalism and integrity of our colleagues at these difficult times. Over the summer, we also began to move to a new service model in our offices in the UK, followed by similar changes in Central Europe, in order to simplify the way we organise ourselves, reduce duplication and cost, and invest in serving shoppers better. In a simpler business, it's particularly important that we still do everything we can to help colleagues develop their careers as they wish, and this year we have continued our apprenticeship programme in the UK, as well as running a Career Academy in our Thai business, for around 150 students. We're also committed to building a team which is diverse, and reflects the communities we serve. We continue to develop an inclusive culture at every level of our organisation, helping our colleagues with the flexibility, skills and reward they need to get on. Suppliers With our suppliers, we are building even closer partnerships, working together to deliver great quality products for our customers and grow our mutual businesses. Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 5 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. indb 5 20 04 2018 15:42 In our most recent anonymous Supplier Viewpoint survey, 83% of our UK & ROI suppliers say they are treated fairly, and 94% say we pay promptly - and for the second year running, we topped the independently-run supplier Advantage Survey. By growing our business with our closest product partners, we have been able to launch new and exclusive products for our customers, and support our suppliers to invest in innovation. This year we have worked with our partners to launch new products including our Wicked Kitchen vegan range in the UK, Eat Fresh produce brand in Malaysia, and an extended Free From range in Central Europe. One example of particularly close partnership is our Tesco Sustainable Dairy Group, which has now paid an extra PS300m to farmers above the market price of milk since it launched - helping them to manage the volatility in milk price experienced by the dairy industry. The group also incentivises our farmers to focus on quality, sustainability and productivity - and following this success, we have set up similar groups for other agricultural products including potatoes, lamb, poultry and eggs. I'm also pleased that 25 of our largest food suppliers have agreed to join us in tackling food waste, by committing to targets on waste, publishing their data, and acting to stop good food going to waste. Shareholders With our business growing again, we resumed the payment of dividends to our shareholders this year - after a three-year absence while we stabilised our business. We remain firmly on track to deliver the mediumterm ambitions we set out in October 2016: to reduce our costs by PS1.5bn, generate PS9bn of retail cash from operations and improve operating margins to between 3.5% and 4.0% by 2019 20. By maintaining a disciplined approach to capital, and further reducing our debt - already down from PS 8.5 bn in 2014 15 to PS 2.6 bn today - we can continue to strengthen our balance sheet and return to investment grade credit metrics. Our underlying philosophy for creating sustainable value for shareholders places increasing focus on cash profitability, free cash flow and earnings growth. An important driver of this growth will come from the benefits of our merger with Booker, which we completed on 5 March 2018. The combined business allows us to access new growth areas, and provide food wherever it is prepared or eaten - 'in home' or 'out of home'. As a result of the merger, I am also delighted to welcome Charles Wilson to the Executive team and Board as our UK & ROI CEO, responsible for both retail and wholesale. A sustainable business It is critically important that as our business delivers growth, we do so in a way which is sustainable. In October 2017, we published our Little Helps Plan, which sets out how we will: - create a business where colleagues can get on, whatever their background: - help our customers make healthier choices and enjoy good quality, sustainable products, at affordable prices: and - help make sure no food that could be eaten is wasted, anywhere in our supply chain. More detail on our performance, including statutory results, can be found in our Financial review on page 12. UK food market: food consumed 'in home' PS110bn UK food market: food consumed 'out of home' PS85bn Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 6 Group Chief Executive's statement continued 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. indb 6 20 04 2018 15:42 We have made good progress in all of these areas this year, and you can read more on pages 16 to 21 of this report. I'm particularly proud of our efforts to stop good food going to waste - in the UK we have donated 19 million meals from surplus this year to help feed people in need, with a further 2 million and 25 million meals from our businesses in the Republic of Ireland and Central Europe respectively. Looking ahead With our business focused on growth, we will continue to deliver on the same plans for Tesco - our six strategic drivers - that have served us well in our turnaround so far. At the same time, we will begin to deliver the substantial synergies that our merger with Booker unlocks: bringing benefits to consumers and colleagues, creating a wider market opportunity for our suppliers and new career opportunities for our colleagues - as well as accelerating the growth of our combined business for shareholders. In what has been a very significant year, I am grateful to every colleague in our business for everything they have done to keep serving shoppers better. It is their dedication and talent which drives all of our plans, and I look forward to continuing our work together as we grow the UK's leading food business. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive For example, our trial of a new Chef Central format is well underway, with a first store in Bar Hill, Cambridge selling products in bulk to professional caterers and the public alongside our existing Tesco Extra store. And, where it's right for our customers, we are offering catering-format products in a number of Tesco stores too. These are just the early stages of the many exciting opportunities in front of us. As we look ahead, our combination of businesses uniquely positions us to better serve the large and growing food market in the UK. The combined Tesco and Booker business allows us to bring together the retail and wholesale expertise of our two businesses, and access new opportunities for growth. Together we employ over 310,000 colleagues in the UK, serve 117,000 independent retailers, 441,000 catering businesses, 641,000 small businesses, and work with over 7,000 suppliers. Through our merger, we will bring benefits to customers, suppliers, colleagues and shareholders: - We will delight consumers with better availability of quality food at attractive prices across retail and eating out locations, and serve better the faster growing 'out of home' food market. - We will help independent retailers, caterers and small businesses by further improving choice, price and service, with enhanced digital and delivery service options. - And for our suppliers, we will create a broader market opportunity, with strong growth prospects and a clear opportunity to develop better own brand and fresh ranges. As our two businesses join forces, we are already beginning to deliver benefits. Importantly, there is no lengthy integration process, as we want to keep the complementary skills of retail and wholesale in our business, and start accessing growth opportunities as quickly as possible. Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 7 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. A differentiated brand A strong and differentiated brand creates long-term value for every stakeholder in our business. Our purpose, to serve shoppers a little better every day, is at the heart of what our brand stands for. Over the last year, we have continued to build trust, and have seen a 5 point improvement in customer recommendations of our brand. We continue to focus on products and services which make the Tesco offer unique, and this year we have relaunched our core and finest food ranges, as well as introducing new brands which are exclusive to Tesco, such as our Hearty Food Co. ready meals, and our Fox & Ivy homeware. Food quality is a particularly powerful driver of supermarket choice, so strengthening customer perceptions of our food is a priority. Our Food Love Stories campaign has continued this year, celebrating the food our customers love to make, for the people they love - and helping increase customer perceptions of quality at Tesco, up 2.7 points year-on-year. But the way customers feel about our brand is defined by more than just our products: it's also about how we respond to the issues that matter to them, from healthy eating to reducing plastic packaging - and the value that Tesco creates for society. In May 2017, we held our first ever health month for colleagues and customers, including helpful 'little swaps' with products that are lower in saturated fat, salt and sugar, and recorded our highest ever score for customers saying that Tesco helps them lead healthier lives. Reduce operating costs by PS1.5bn We continue to simplify our business and reduce costs, with in-year savings of PS594m - and PS820m of savings to date towards our PS1.5bn ambition. We have reviewed every aspect of our operation to identify opportunities for savings - with a particular focus on our store operating model, where we have delivered PS541m of savings: logistics and distribution, with PS104m of savings: and goods not for resale, where we have made savings of PS174m. We continue to encourage a cost-conscious culture, finding savings so that we can reinvest for the benefit of customers. We have also simplified the shopping experience for customers, at the same time as reducing costs, for example by increasing availability of our Scan As You Shop self-scan handsets - now in over 500 UK stores and beginning to roll out in Central Europe - and making till receipts optional in our smaller stores, which has generated savings of around PS3m. We have also made strong progress in reducing the costs of procuring goods and services not for resale, finding synergies across the Group. In particular, we have improved our services in facilities management, freight and media services, while also delivering savings of PS50m. Generate PS9bn cash from operations Our focus on free cash generation continues, and Retail cash generated from operations increased by PS495m to PS2,773m this year, driven by improved profitability and strong working capital management. One example of our work is in reducing stockholding, by improving the way we receive deliveries from our suppliers. To minimise our environmental impact, and reduce transport costs, we order full trucks of products from suppliers whenever we can - which sometimes means 'rounding up' an order. However, by analysing our orders forensically, we have been able to sort stock between trucks and identify where we can eliminate a truck. This removes unnecessary journeys for our suppliers, and allows us to take out unnecessary 'rounded' stock. Because we are ordering only what's needed to ensure great availability, our customers can buy what they want, and we can order less. Our six strategic drivers will create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. An update on our six strategic drivers. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 8 The six strategic drivers 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. Maximise the mix to achieve a 3.5% - 4.0% margin To achieve our 3.5% - 4.0% margin ambition by our 2019 20 financial year, we continue to build sustainable profitability across our businesses, channels and product ranges. By carefully managing the combination of volume, mix and cost-effectiveness in our business, Group operating margin for this year was 2.9% - up 57 basis points. In Asia, our margin has grown to 6.0%, as we have stepped back from unprofitable bulk selling in Thailand. This was a deliberate decision that we took at the start of the year, allowing us to focus on serving our core retail customers better, and increase profitability. In our online business, we are improving the economics of our offer, while giving customers greater choice and flexibility. For example, we have extended our delivery saver subscription service, to introduce new monthly plans - offering a great value option to our most loyal customers. We have also extended our Click & Collect options - including same-day collection - with slots at a range of prices so that customers can choose the service most convenient to them. Maximise value from property Our property portfolio across the Group is significant, and we are looking at opportunities to better use our space for the benefit of customers, while also releasing value where it's the right thing to do for our business. Over the last three years, we have released a cumulative PS1.4bn of value from property proceeds, at the same time as increasing our proportion of freehold property in the UK & ROI from 41% to 52%. In the UK, we are exploring a small number of opportunities to work with a third-party to re-develop our store sites in high-value locations. Our Hackney store in London is one such example, where we have sold the site for a mixed-use development - allowing us to release value, while still retaining a store on the new site and with continuity of trade throughout. We can also create value for our customers by using space in new ways, as we repurpose space in our larger stores - and this year, we have repurposed 1.1m sq. In Central Europe, we have worked with partners to bring a new offer to customers in a number of our stores - and this year, across the region, we opened ten shop units with H&M, and three with Decathlon. Innovation To serve our shoppers a little better every day, it's important we listen and respond to their needs, with innovation across every aspect of our offer, and a strong pipeline of ideas to come to market. We have innovated in our product ranges - for example, with the launch of our exclusive Wicked Kitchen range of plant-based dishes, including new ingredients and exotic preparations such as carrot 'pastrami' and eryngii mushroom 'bolognese'. The range responds to increasing demand for vegetarian and vegan food, and since its January launch has proved extremely popular with customers. As customers look for increasingly convenient options to do their shopping, this year we became the first retailer in the UK to offer same-day grocery deliveries nationwide, and in London - through our Tesco Now app - we can deliver within an hour. And at Tesco Bank, our award-winning Tesco Pay digital wallet continues to prove popular with customers, with over 450,000 downloads of the app. 9 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic report 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. Customers Tesco exists to serve customers - listening to them and acting on what is most important, however they choose to shop with us. Product We build close and mutually-beneficial relationships with our supplier partners, to source the best possible products that meet and anticipate customers' needs. Reinvest Our focus is always on making Tesco the best it can be for our customers. The better a job we do for customers, the more we will improve sales: the more our sales improve, the more we can reinvest in further improving the shopping trip. Channels To bring the best products to customers we work through a range of channels - from small shops to large shops, and our online business.

A detailed analysis of discontinued operations can be found in Note 7. This was another strong performance for Tesco with results ahead of expectations. We grew sales by 0.6%, excluding VAT, excluding fuel, at constant exchange rates and experienced like-for-like sales growth of 0.7%. Group operating profit before exceptional items was PS1,644m, up 28.4% on last year as we significantly strengthened our profitability, remaining firmly on track to deliver our medium-term ambitions. Our statutory profit before tax increased to PS1,298m including PS155m of exceptional items. We generated retail operating cash flow of PS2.8bn, up 21.7% on last year, driven by the strong improvement in our operating profit. We reduced net debt excluding Tesco Bank by 29.6% to PS 2.6 bn. We are well placed to deliver our ambition of a Group operating margin of 3.5%-4.0% by the 2019 20 financial year. This ambition is underpinned by six strategic drivers, including the PS1.5bn operating cost reductions which we are on track to secure, having delivered cumulative savings of PS820m to date. Reflecting our improved performance and confidence in future prospects, the Board has proposed the payment of a 2.0 pence per share final dividend following on from the interim dividend of 1.0 pence per share. We expect dividends to grow towards a target cover of around two times earnings per share over the medium term.

In the UK, like-for-like sales growth of 2.2% includes our ninth consecutive quarter of positive performance, despite an ongoing drag of 0.4 % from general merchandise as we take action to fide-emphasise certain categories. We delivered a consistently strong performance in fresh food, outperforming the market in volume terms. During the fourth quarter we experienced some distribution-related disruption, following the administration of Palmer & Harvey, resulting in lost tobacco sales across December. Despite these challenges, which are now behind us, we continued to deliver positive sales momentum through the fourth quarter. Market conditions have remained challenging with continued cost price inflation. We have worked hard with our supplier partners throughout the year to mitigate price increases wherever possible, and made a significant investment in the first half to further hold back inflation and protect customers. We have continued to reduce promotional participation over the year, focusing instead on consistently offering the best value for customers on all of our products. Our own brand ranges have performed very well, with like-for-like sales growing 4.2% year-on-year. We have embarked on a re-launch of over 10,000 own brand products, across our entry, core and finest ranges, with the initial focus on ready meals and Italian products. Our new, exclusive Hearty Food Co. range of ready meals and improved core Tesco products have proved particularly popular, contributing to an increase in overall own brand participation of nearly one percent. We have continued to refine our general merchandise range, reducing SKUs by 16%, as we focus on categories with more sustainable profitability. We have delivered 2.7% sales growth in our home category, following the launch of our new own brand Go Cook and Fox & Ivy ranges. These new brands have driven a 14% and 20% increase in customers to our cook and homeware ranges, respectively. Clothing performed well during the year with like-for-like sales growth of 2.6%, reflecting the strength of the F&F brand and quality of our range. All store formats and channels have achieved like-for-like growth, with our large store business growing at 1.9% and our online grocery sales growing 5.1% with both higher order numbers and increased average basket size. In ROI, like-for-like sales grew by 2.7%, improving steadily throughout the year as customers responded well to an even more competitive price position. The main driver of growth was a 4.2% increase in volume, ahead of market volume growth. Fresh food volumes were particularly strong, growing by 5.2% year-on-year.

Our efforts to reduce operating costs and improve efficiencies across our store estate and head office have delivered a significant increase in profitability, particularly during the second half when our operating margin reached 2.5%, up 67 basis points year-on-year. Further progress on maximising the mix within our business and driving volume more selectively, particularly in general merchandise, has aided margin expansion.

Our focus on improving the quality and breadth of the range in our stores has delivered positive results with fresh food sales growth of 1.2%. However, this growth was held back by declines in general merchandise and clothing. Our convenience formats delivered positive like-for-like growth across all countries. We have continued to exit from unprofitable stores in the region, with 28 store closures contributing to an overall sales reduction of 1.6 % at constant exchange rates. Legislative changes in the region are affecting our business, with Poland phasing in a gradual ban on Sunday trading from March 2018, which takes complete effect by 2020. Central Europe operating profit before exceptional items was PS119m, up PS61m year-on-year at actual exchange rates. We have made continued progress towards operating the four markets we serve as one combined region, helping to improve our customer offer. In the first half of the year we opened a new distribution centre in Galanta, Slovakia serving all four countries and benefiting from the best local practices in the region. The resulting benefits of more effective stock management combined with our other efforts on cost savings have more than offset the impact of inflation on the cost base and enabled us to improve profitability.

Adjusting for this impact, underlying like-for-like sales in the region were down 1.0 %, largely reflecting the deflationary effect of lowering our fresh food prices for customers. Asia operating profit before exceptional items was PS299m, up 7.6% at constant exchange rates and up 14.1% at actual exchange rates. This improvement has been driven by refocusing on our core retail offer and continuing to reduce our cost base as part of the Group's overall cost savings programme. Tesco Bank 2017 18 2016 17 Year-on-year change Revenue PS1,051m PS1,012m 3.9% Operating profit before exceptional items PS173m PS157m 10.2% Operating profit PS149m PS77m 93.5% Lending to customers PS11,522m PS9,961m 15.7% Customer deposits PS9,245m PS8,463m 9.2% Net interest margin 3.9% 4.0% 0.1 % Risk asset ratio 19.3% 20.0% 0.7 % Tesco Bank celebrated twenty years of serving Tesco shoppers this year. Throughout the year, the Bank has continued to strengthen its product and service offering to customers, delivering growth of 4.1% in active customer account numbers across its primary products. During the year, we completed the roll-out of Tesco Pay, the Group's digital wallet offering, to every one of our stores in the UK. In July 2017, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of the launch of our mortgage product, which has now reached PS3.0bn in balances. Operating profit before exceptional items increased by 10.2% year-on-year to PS173m. Lending growth in the year has been strong, driven by secured mortgage lending which now comprises 26% of the lending portfolio, versus 22% last year. In addition, Money Services products such as our Travel Money offer have performed well overall as the Group continues to enhance the product range and expand the customer base. Exceptional items of PS 24 m relating to Tesco Bank include an increase in the provision for customer redress and a credit received following the conclusion of negotiations with a third party in respect of previously recognised customer redress. The balance sheet remains strong and well-positioned to support future lending growth from both a liquidity and capital perspective with a risk asset ratio of 19.3%.

In the current year, the net effect of exceptional items on operating profit is PS193m. Net restructuring and redundancy charges of PS 102 m relate principally to structural changes to our business to simplify our operating model within stores and head office. The net impairment reversal of non-current assets and onerous lease provisions of PS53m includes a net reversal of PS185m in property, plant and equipment and investment property, a net PS 24 m charge in software and other intangible assets and a net charge of PS 108 m of onerous lease provisions. Provision for customer redress of PS 24 m relating to Tesco Bank, includes an increase of PS 35 m in the provision for Payment Protection Insurance PPI, partially offset by a PS1m Consumer Credit Act CCA provision release and a credit of PS10m received following the conclusion of negotiations with a third party in respect of previously recognised customer redress. The investment disposal profit of PS124m reflects the sale of our remaining minority stake in the Lazada e-commerce platform, completed during the first half. The sale of our opticians business in the UK & ROI to Vision Express resulted in a PS38m gain on disposal. 13 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic report 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. indb 13 20 04 2018 15:42 Two property-related transactions completed in the UK in the first half of the year account for the majority of the PS79m property transactions within exceptional items. In the prior year, we took an exceptional charge of PS 235 m in respect of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement DPA between Tesco Stores Limited and the UK Serious Fraud Office SFO regarding historic accounting practices and an agreement with the UK Financial Conduct Authority FCA of a finding of market abuse in relation to the Tesco PLC trading statement announced on 29 August 2014. Included in this charge was PS 85 m for the Shareholder Compensation Scheme. With the Compensation Scheme now being closed to new claimants, we have released PS25m of the amounts provided. Outstanding claims submitted before the 22 February 2018 deadline are still being processed. Joint ventures and associates, interest and tax Joint ventures and associates Our share of post-tax losses from joint ventures and associates before exceptional items was PS 6 m, an improvement of PS24m year-on-year due to reduced losses recognised in Gain Land, our joint venture in China. There were no exceptional items this year relating to our share of post-tax losses from joint ventures and associates. Finance income and costs 2017 18 2016 17 Interest payable on medium term notes, loans and bonds PS 363 m PS 434 m Interest receivable on associated derivatives PS31m PS6m Net interest on medium term notes, loans and bonds PS 332 m PS 428 m Other interest receivable and similar income PS44m PS42m Other finance charges and interest payable PS 70 m PS 89 m Capitalised interest PS2m PS6m Net finance cost before exceptional charges, IAS 19 net pension finance costs and IAS 39 fair value remeasurements PS 356 m PS 469 m IAS 39 fair value remeasurements PS23m PS61m IAS 19 net pension finance costs PS 162 m PS 113 m Exceptional charge - translation of Korea proceeds PS 38 m PS 244 m Net finance costs PS 533 m PS 765 m Net finance costs before exceptional charges, IAS 19 net pension finance costs and IAS 39 fair value remeasurements reduced by PS113m year-on-year to PS 356 m. This 24.1% decline year-on-year was mainly driven by a net PS96m reduction in interest on interest-bearing liabilities. Debt maturities totalled PS1.4bn during the year and we also undertook PS1.3bn of bond tenders in two separate liability management exercises. These bond tenders during the year contributed to PS23m lower interest costs and we expect an associated reduction in interest payable of c. PS50m on an annualised basis. In cash interest terms, we were helped by a favourable timing benefit of PS55m on our largest sterling-denominated bond, for which no annual coupon payment was made during the year owing to the timing of our year-end date. Net finance costs, which include non-cash items, were around 30% lower year-on-year. Fair value remeasurements are largely driven by changes in the market assessment of credit risk and various market indices which can fluctuate significantly. Net pension finance costs increased by PS 49 m year-on-year driven by a higher opening pension deficit part offset by a lower opening discount rate. Net pension finance costs are calculated by multiplying the opening deficit by the opening discount rate each year. For 2018 19, they are expected to decrease to c. PS 95 m as the impact of a higher opening discount rate is more than offset by the year-on-year reduction in deficit. The exceptional charge of PS 38 m relating to the translation of the remaining proceeds from the sale of our business in Korea will not arise again since the funds have now been moved to a Sterling denominated entity within the Group. The proceeds had been held in GBP money market funds in a non-Sterling denominated subsidiary and the translation effect represents no economic cost to the Group. Group tax Tax on profit before exceptional items was PS 286 m, with an effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items for the Group of 25.0%. As previously indicated, this tax rate is higher than the UK statutory rate primarily due to the depreciation of assets that do not qualify for tax relief and the impact of the 8% supplementary tax surcharge on bank profits. We expect the impact of these items on the effective tax rate to reduce as our overall level of profitability continues to increase, and therefore we expect the effective tax rate to reduce to around 20% in the medium term. The effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items for the 2018 19 financial year is expected to be around 24%. Earnings per share on a continuing operations basis Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items were 11.88p, nearly 63% higher year-on-year principally due to our stronger profit performance. Statutory basic earnings per share from continuing operations were 12.12p, up from 0.81p last year. Summary of total indebtedness 2017 18 2016 17 Movement Net debt excludes Tesco Bank PS 2,625 m PS 3,729 m PS1,104m Discounted operating lease commitments PS 6,931 m PS 7,440 m PS509m Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax PS 2,728 m PS 5,504 m PS2,776m Total indebtedness PS 12,284 m PS 16,673 m PS4,389m Retail net debt reduced by PS1.1bn to PS 2.6 bn as retail operating cash flow and disposal proceeds were greater than capital expenditure and other charges. Within net debt, we used surplus cash to prepay PS1.3bn of the Group's long-dated bonds as part of an ongoing focus to strengthen the balance sheet. We have a strong funding and liquidity profile underpinned by PS4.2bn committed facilities and our key credit metrics, fixed charge cover and total indebtedness EBITDAR, have improved to 2.7 times and 3.3 times respectively. Discounted operating lease commitments have reduced by PS509m, including the benefit from the buyback of 17 stores in the UK during the year. We anticipate rental savings of PS26m on an annualised basis as a result of these property purchases. On an IAS 19 basis, the pension deficit measure net of deferred tax has reduced from PS5.5bn last year to PS2.7bn at the end of the current year. The movement during the year was partly driven by an increase in yields on corporate bonds, which drive the discount rate used for accounting purposes and our decision at the half-year stage to update the discount rate model in line with developing market practice and following actuarial advice. In the Group's view, it now more appropriately reflects expected yields on corporate bonds over the life of the scheme's liabilities. At the same time, the application of latest industry life expectancy tables and favourable actual scheme experience have also contributed to the reduction. During the year, the triennial pension review was concluded, with the business and the Trustees agreeing that annual contributions will increase by PS15m to PS285m per annum from April 2018, with our framework for the long-term funding of the scheme unchanged. As at 31 March 2017, the actuarial deficit was PS3.0bn, an increase of c. PS0.25bn since the last triennial valuation. Overall, total indebtedness has reduced by PS4.4bn in the year. Net debt has reduced by almost PS6bn over the last three years. Summary retail cash flow Retail operating cash flow increased by PS495m to PS2,773m in the year. This increase of 21.7% year-on-year, was mainly driven by improved Group profitability. Further improvements in working capital of PS499m also contributed to the improvement in cash flow, although this includes PS102m of timing benefits principally as a consequence of the failure of a supplier towards the end of the year. Exceptional cash items increased year-on-year, largely driven by a cash outflow of PS149m relating to payment of the SFO fine and initial Shareholder Compensation Scheme payments. We expect a further cash outflow of c. PS60m relating to such claims. Other cash exceptional items totalling PS169m include a PS160m VAT refund from HMRC regarding the treatment of VAT on Clubcard rewards, which HMRC have appealed. This has no net effect in the Group income statement. Cash capital expenditure of PS 1.2 bn was up year-on-year due to the timing of payments relating to commitments made towards the end of the last financial year. Combined net cash interest and tax of PS 428 m was PS113m lower than last year largely as a result of debt maturities and bond tenders. We generated PS253m of proceeds from property sales and completed the buyback of 17 stores during the year, for a cash consideration of PS393m.

Finally, cash inflows of PS362m relating to disposals and dividends received includes consideration of PS196m from the sale of our remaining minority stake in the Lazada online business, a dividend of PS50m from Tesco Bank, and proceeds of PS45m relating to the disposal of our opticians business in the UK to Vision Express, in addition to a number of smaller transactions. Retail free cash flow of PS1,377m is up 7.0% year-on-year. This is lower than the rate of growth in retail operating cash flow principally due to timing of cash capital expenditure and lower property proceeds. Capital expenditure 2017 18 2016 17 UK & ROI PS676m PS731m Central Europe PS133m PS141m Asia PS239m PS261m Tesco Bank PS50m PS46m Group PS1,098m PS1,179m On an accrued basis, capital expenditure excluding buybacks of PS1.1bn was PS0.1bn lower than last year reflecting our disciplined approach to capital spending and focus on delivering attractive returns. Our capital expenditure in the UK focused on maintaining and replacing essential assets, alongside programmes to refresh and repurpose the estate, enhancing our store operations. New store capex has mainly been allocated to our new store opening programme in Thailand, with a limited number of Express store openings and a net gain of one new superstore in the UK. Our capital expenditure in Central Europe relates mainly to repurposing of existing stores. We expect capital expenditure to remain within a range of PS1.1bn-PS1.4bn. There was a net reduction of 1.2 m square feet, including 1.1 m square feet of space repurposed to a range of complementary partners such as Arcadia Group and H&M. Across the Group, our repurposing programme has focused on improving the ease and relevance of our large-store shopping trip for customers. In the UK & ROI, we have repurposed 75,000 square feet across 20 stores. Within the year, we opened over 50 concessions within our stores including Arcadia Group, Holland & Barrett, Dixons Carphone and Next. A brand new Booker 'Chef Central' concept store was also opened within the Tesco Extra store at Bar Hill, Cambridge in February 2018. The store primarily serves professional caterers but is open to all customers. In Central Europe, we have primarily been partnering with other clothing brands in repurposed store space including H&M and Decathlon. In Asia, we have worked with a range of different partners across a variety of brands including MR. DIY and Major Cineplex. Property The estimated market value of our fully owned property has increased by PS0.8bn to PS20.7bn, with a surplus of PS2.5bn over the net book value NBV. Our Group freehold property ownership percentage, by value, has increased to 58% from 57% last year, driven by the UK & ROI. We regained ownership of 17 stores in the UK during the year, increasing our proportion of freehold ownership by value in the UK & ROI to 52%. This repurchase of stores will result in an annualised rental saving of PS26m. We continue to seek opportunities to further reduce our exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift rent inflation where the economics are attractive. Dividend We propose to pay a final dividend of 2.0 pence per ordinary share. The proposed final dividend was approved by the Board of Directors on 10 April 2018 and is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 15 June 2018. This takes the total dividend for the year to 3.0 pence per ordinary share following the payment of an interim dividend of 1.0 pence per ordinary share in November 2017. We anticipate a split of broadly one-third to two-thirds between next year's interim and final dividends and intend to reach our targeted cover of around two times earnings in the medium term. Merger with Booker Group We completed our merger with Booker Group on 5 March 2018, after the end of the Tesco financial year. Our ' Joining Forces' integration programme is well underway and we are focused on delivering the PS200m recurring run-rate synergies identified during the merger process by the end of the third year post-completion. Booker Q4 results show a continued strong performance, with customer satisfaction up 0.3% to 85.7% and like-for-like sales up 9.9%. While Booker's full year results are still subject to audit approval, operating profit before exceptional items for the financial year to 30 March 2018 is c. PS195m and net cash is c. PS120m. Transaction costs of PS 26 m relating to our merger with Booker were included in Tesco's UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items in the 2016 17 financial year. Further costs and fees of PS 21 m arising in the 2017 18 financial year have been treated in a consistent fashion. A similar amount, consisting of stamp duty costs directly arising from the completion of the merger, will be charged to underlying profit in the 2018 19 financial year. As outlined in our merger prospectus, we anticipate up to PS 145 m of integration costs over three years, which will be treated as exceptional. Looking ahead We remain firmly on track to deliver the medium-term ambitions we set out in October 2016: to reduce our costs by PS1.5bn, to generate PS9bn of retail cash from operations and to improve operating margins to between 3.5% and 4.0% by 2019 20. In addition, by further reducing debt and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital we can continue to strengthen the balance sheet and generate an increasing level of free cash flow. Our intention remains to return to an investment grade credit rating, with our key metrics being fixed charge cover and total indebtedness EBITDAR. The integration of Booker is well underway and we are focused on delivering the identified synergies to create value for all stakeholders. We anticipate a synergy benefit of c. PS60m in the first year, growing to a cumulative c. PS140m in the second year and reaching a recurring run-rate of c. PS200m per year by the end of the third year. As we look to capitalise on the enhanced opportunities for growth available to the combined Group, we will place increasing focus on growth in earnings and free cash flow generation, in order to deliver strong, sustainable returns for shareholders.

The Little Helps Plan outlines how Tesco works in partnership with others, including suppliers, NGOs, governments and other retailers, to make a positive contribution and work towards shared global ambitions. The plan builds on the progress we have made so far and covers three areas core to the long-term success of our business: people, products and places. In October 2017, we shared targets and actions under each of these three pillars. More information on these can be found at www. The Little Helps Plan covers our retail businesses in the UK, Republic of Ireland, Central Europe and Asia. However, with the majority of our customers being in the UK, implementation of the plan and reporting will begin with the UK business. We have committed to sharing our progress along the way and will next update in October 2018. Accountability for the Little Helps Plan is led at an Executive level by Jane Lawrie, Group Communications Director, and at the Board level by Dave Lewis, Group Chief Executive. Our Corporate Responsibility Committee, chaired by Lindsey Pownall, Non-executive Director, governs the plan. More information on the activities of the Corporate Responsibility Committee can be found in the Corporate governance report on page 39. Our approach 'Every little help makes a big difference' is our third value and emphasises our belief that small actions can add up to make a big difference. Our Little Helps Plan identifies the most pressing social and environmental challenges facing the business, our customers and our communities, and outlines our commitments to help tackle these. People The 440,000 colleagues who work for us around the world are at the forefront of serving our shoppers better every day. We want to give them a great experience of working at Tesco and be a place where everyone can get on, whatever their ambitions. To do this, we are investing in training so colleagues are supported to develop their careers and to build skills for their future. We are committed to building an inclusive culture and ensuring these opportunities are available to all colleagues. We are also trialling a number of innovative solutions that will offer colleagues greater flexibility over their own work schedules. Our target To help our colleagues succeed by providing them with the flexibility, skills and reward they need to get on. For the full list of our targets and actions see our Little Helps Plan at www.

Building strong, trusted relationships with our suppliers plays a key role in achieving this. Health Our customers and colleagues tell us that they want to make healthier choices, but sometimes it can be difficult. We want to make it easier to lead a healthier life and we are focused on offering simple, practical actions that lead to sustainable changes. Packaging We know packaging plays an important role in preserving and protecting products but we are taking action to reduce its overall impact on the environment. We are working with the industry to develop a closed loop system which can be applied to all key packaging materials. Food waste We have a responsibility and commitment to lead reduction of food waste from farm to fork. Through our Group Chief Executive's Chairmanship of the international Champions 12.3 coalition, we are committed to accelerating progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal target to halve per capita global food waste by 2030. Our targets To help make sustainable products accessible and affordable for all. To support all of our colleagues to live healthier lives and help our customers make healthier food choices every time they shop with us. To ensure we never use more packaging than is needed, and that what we do use is from sustainable sources and goes on to be reused or recycled. To help halve global food waste, farm to fork, by 2030. Places We are proud to be a valued part of over 6,000 communities around the world and want to help them thrive. We bring social and economic benefits through the local people we employ, the local businesses we work with and the local projects we support. We support causes important to colleagues and customers. We deliver this through our community donation programmes, strategic partnerships with charities and support for food banks. Our target To help our local communities thrive by positively contributing both socially and economically. Foundations Underpinning all the pillars of the Little Helps Plan are a number of areas where it is vital to do the right thing. It remains a priority for us to ensure our products are safe, that we have a strong health and safety culture for customers and colleagues, and that we stay on track with our ambitious plan to become a zero-carbon business. We recognise that these areas and strong corporate governance are equally important to ensuring our business is having a positive impact on society. They are core expectations and are embedded in the way we do business. 17 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic report 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. indb 17 20 04 2018 15:43 shopping baskets outside of seasonal changes. For colleagues we have given out free fruit and offered mini health checks throughout our health events. In 2017 18 we also made mental wellbeing training available for all colleagues and brought together a group of colleague Health Heroes to share their stories and inspire others to make healthier choices. In January 2018, we announced a groundbreaking new five-year strategic partnership with the British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK and Diabetes UK. The aim of the partnership is to help reduce the risk of heart and circulatory disease, cancer and diabetes. The partnership will support colleagues, customers and their families to make sustainable lifestyle changes and adopt healthier habits. For more information visit www. Packaging We continue to make changes to our packaging to help reduce our impact on the environment. 87% of our Own Brand packaging by weight is currently widely recyclable. We have made significant changes to the packaging of our wet wipes, resulting in a 20% reduction in the material used and thereby removing 57 tonnes of plastic. This material saving is enough to make over 10 million more packs. We recognise that we can do more in partnership with government and industry to help establish a robust, closed loop approach to recover and reuse all key packaging materials. We have three strategic priorities to help reduce packaging waste and boost recycling across the UK: 1. Materials and design: In collaboration with our suppliers we are reducing packaging and restricting the number of materials we accept so that less packaging is used and packaging is easier to recycle. Recovery and recycling: We believe a holistic approach is required to create an integrated national recovery and recycling system. We support developing a cost-effective Deposit Return System DRS as one aspect of this approach. Changing customer behaviour: Once consistent recycling infrastructure is in place, we can help customers recycle more with simple, clear information. Tackling food waste Five years ago, we made a commitment to lead on reducing global food waste in our own operation, supply chains, and in our customers' homes. Food waste is a global challenge and through our international markets and Dave Lewis's Chairmanship of the international Champions 12.3 coalition, we are committed to driving progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal target to halve per capita global food waste by 2030. Products Sourcing with care In our UK supply chains, we are prioritising the environmental and social risks associated with 20 of our most important products and ingredients - from beef and coffee, to wild fish and cotton. To view the full top 20 list and some of the actions we are taking, visit www. Collaboration with suppliers, industry organisations, government bodies and civil society is vital for us to make progress. For example, we know that soil degradation is a key issue facing agricultural products and the environment. We analysed the most vulnerable regions we sourced from and in 2017 we started a new project in partnership with the Broads Authority and with the support of the Rivers Trust, National Farmers Union NFU and the Environment Agency. To raise awareness of the impact of water run-off with potato growers in East Anglia, we tested new technologies that help retain valuable top soil and reduce the amount of fertiliser entering local waterways. Working with partners, we will share the learnings in other key sourcing regions. This year, as part of our human rights due diligence approach, we have engaged stakeholders and other businesses to further understand the risks of forced labour in palm oil supply chains. 100% of the palm oil used in our Own Brand products in the UK is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil but we want to take further action to mitigate the social challenges associated with palm oil production. Our engagement has helped us identify and understand the areas of greatest risk, and we are working collaboratively through the Consumer Goods Forum to tackle this challenge as an industry. com sourcing for more information and www. com modernslavery for our latest Modern Slavery Statement. A healthier place to work and shop For many years we'five worked hard to help colleagues and customers make healthier food choices. We are also continuing to work with our suppliers to reduce the amount of sugar, fat and salt in thousands of products. In Central Europe in 2017 we reviewed 120 Own Brand soft drinks and introduced a new standard to limit the sugar to less than 1 teaspoon per 100ml. This follows the UK business which, by November 2016, had reduced the sugar in all Own Brand soft drinks to below the threshold for the government levy. We'five also helped increase consumption of fruit and vegetables by introducing new, great value ranges such as Farm Brands and Perfectly Imperfect. Our Free Fruit for Kids initiative remains popular in the UK and since 2016, we have given out 50 million pieces of free fruit in 800 stores. In May 2017 we held our first ever in-store health event in the UK. As part of this we reduced the price of 200 healthier products and highlighted in-store and online products which are lower in sugar, fat or salt. As a result, we saw the biggest monthly improvement in the health of our customers' In 2017 18, the 10 million tonnes of food sold in the UK retail operations generated 73,340 tonnes 0.7% of surplus. 53,126 tonnes 0.5% was wasted, which we sent for energy recovery. Of this, just 19,898 tonnes 0.2% was safe for human consumption. In September 2017 we also shared our 2016 17 food waste data for the Republic of Ireland and Central Europe for the first time. The page opposite gives a breakdown on our food surplus and waste in all these markets for 2017 18. In 2016, we made the commitment that no food that is safe for human consumption will go to waste from our UK retail operations by the end of 2017 18. We have worked hard to deliver our target through the launch of new industry leading initiatives. Surplus food safe for humans is offered to local charities through Community Food Connection. Food not taken by charities is offered to colleagues through our 'colleague shops' which have been rolled out to all stores. We send any suitable remaining surplus to animal feed. We have achieved huge progress in ensuring more good food goes to charity and we are now introducing a further programme of work to ensure no food safe for human consumption goes to waste. Our other markets share the same ambition and food redistribution programmes are now in all stores in the Republic of Ireland and all hypermarkets in Bangkok and Malaysia. In Central Europe over 600 stores out of a total 961 are already donating surplus food and all remaining stores will be donating by 2020. We are also working in partnership with our suppliers to offer customers the food they love with less waste. In 2017 18, we introduced resealable salad bags across our most popular salad lines and became the first UK supermarket to start selling perfectly ripe green satsumas and clementines that stay fresher for longer. In Central Europe, we introduced our Perfectly Imperfect range which has helped save over 6,000 tonnes of 'wonky' fruit and vegetables from going to waste. With 25 of our largest suppliers, we have announced a joint commitment to adopt UN Sustainable Development Goal target 12.3, measure and publish food waste data for their own operations and act to reduce food waste farm to fork. We are planning to build on this work over the coming year across more of our supply chains and communicate with customers on how they can reduce food waste in the home.

' Urszula Wisniewska Manager of Mozesz wiecej Poland beneficiary People Colleagues have told us how important flexibility and certainty are in order for them to reach their ambitions both inside and outside of work. In 2017 18 we started to trial a new app in the UK that allows colleagues to see their shifts, manage overtime and request holiday. In time the app will also give the option to swap shifts, request shift changes and even take shifts in different stores - providing them with genuine flexibility and control over their hours. We have committed to rolling out this app in all our markets and have already started to introduce a simplified version in our Asian stores. Our UK apprenticeship programme aims to give over 1,000 colleagues, of all ages and all levels of experience, the opportunity to continue their education and build skills for their future. With technology transforming society, we are also developing a training programme to ensure that all our colleagues have the digital competence and confidence to succeed. Inclusivity and creating a culture where everyone has equal opportunity remains integral to our business. In January 2018 we pledged support to the UN standards promoting the rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex LGBTI people. More recently we signed up to the 30% Club, demonstrating our commitment to having strong female representation within our senior leadership team by 2020. The ratio of male to female colleagues at 2017 18 year-end is outlined in the table below. Further analysis of our gender pay gap can also be found in the Corporate governance report on page 47 or online. Places In 2017 18 we have continued to support communities through our community donation initiatives. We have established programmes in the UK Bags of Help, Republic of Ireland Community Fund and Central Europe You Choose, We Help. All of these programmes put the power in the hands of our customers to choose the local projects that Tesco supports financially. In Central Europe one in every four customers voted in 'You Choose, We Help'. Through these programmes we have distributed over PS51m and supported more than 24,000 local projects to date. Wherever we operate we also work closely with food banks and local charities to help feed people in need in local communities. In 2017 18 we donated the equivalent of 46 million meals to help feed people in need across the UK, Republic of Ireland, and Central Europe through our food surplus redistribution programmes. In January 2018, all our stores in Malaysia also participated in a campaign which enabled customers to donate food to 100 local charities supporting vulnerable families and homeless people. In Thailand, customer fundraising meant that underprivileged children were able to have nutritious lunches throughout February 2018.

The location-method impact is provided for disclosure only and all intensity, net and gross emissions shown are calculated using the market-based method. Foundations Climate change In May 2017, we announced the new science-based targets on the right, which are aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement recommendation of a 1.5 degree global warming trajectory. They will also enable us to meet our ambition to become a zero-carbon business by 2050. Our carbon footprint is calculated according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and our net carbon footprint in 2017 18 was 3.4 million tonnes of CO 2 e. For our own operations absolute carbon emissions we achieved a 13% reduction compared to last year and 26% compared to 2015 16. To help us achieve our new targets, we have committed to source 100% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. In 2017 18, 55% of our electricity across the Group was from renewable sources and in the UK we have already switched to 100% renewable purchased electricity, supported by renewable energy certificates. This, in addition to investments in energy efficiency, has enabled us to reduce our net carbon intensity per sq. ft. of retail and distribution floor space by 6% compared with last year, and 15% since 2015 16. Our targets Reduce absolute carbon emissions from our operations from 2015 16 levels: 35% by 2020, 60% by 2025 and 100% by 2050. Source 65% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2020 and 100% by 2030. Anti-bribery and fraud We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethics and integrity in the way we do business around the world. We adopt a zero tolerance approach to bribery and fraud at Tesco and expect our business partners to do the same. Our Code of Business Conduct outlines our most important legal obligations and the policies that guide the conduct of all our colleagues in areas including health and safety, information security, bribery and fraud. In February 2018, we refreshed all our communications on the Code and held an internal campaign to encourage colleagues to speak up if they have any concerns the Code is not being followed. To support this culture, we also provide an independent and confidential whistleblowing service - Protector Line - that enables our colleagues, suppliers and their staff around the world to raise concerns. We use e-learning to support compliance with the Code and anti-bribery and anti-fraud training is included in our annual refresher training for all relevant colleagues. Everyone in the business must comply with the Code and we have implemented annual Code compliance declarations which are reviewed by our Group Risk and Compliance Committee. 21 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic report 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR.",

        "Detailed Analysis of ROE": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is ROE increasing or declining?**  \n  The **Return on Equity (ROE)** has declined from **0.015998** (1.6%) in the previous year to **-0.006213** (-0.62%) in the current year, indicating a negative trend and deterioration in the company's ability to generate returns on shareholders' equity.\n\n- **Is growth in ROE higher than that of competitors and the industry?**  \n  The report does not provide explicit competitor or industry ROE data. However, the decline into negative territory suggests Tesco is underperforming relative to typical industry standards, especially given the historic improvements in operating profit and cash flow noted in the report.\n\n- **Is growth persistent or temporary?**  \n  The decline appears to be influenced by **exceptional items** including provisions related to historic accounting practices, restructuring costs, and customer redress, which negatively impacted statutory profits. While underlying operational improvements (like a 29.9% increase in operating profit before exceptional items and a reduction in net debt) show progress, the **negative ROE** suggests the recent drop may be partly **temporary**, linked to these exceptional charges and pension deficits, but risks remain due to ongoing external challenges.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected ROE next year:**  \n  Given the company's strategic focus on rebuilding profitability, cost reductions targeting **PS1.5bn** savings, and the intention to resume dividends from 2017-18, the **ROE is expected to improve** and potentially return to modest positive territory, but full recovery to prior levels may take 1-2 years depending on the resolution of exceptional costs and pension liabilities.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- Tesco's **ROE deteriorated from +1.6% to -0.62%**, mainly driven by significant **exceptional charges** and pension deficit increases despite operational profit growth.\n- Operational improvements such as a **29.9% increase in operating profit before exceptionals**, reduction in net debt by **27%**, and improving cash flows indicate a positive underlying business momentum.\n- The negative ROE reflects **temporary setbacks from historic issues and restructuring**, but the company\u2019s strategic plans and cost-saving initiatives provide a reasonable basis for recovery over the medium term.\n- Risks include continued external pressures such as **business rates, wage costs, competition, and pension liabilities**, which may constrain ROE recovery.\n- The company\u2019s **focus on shareholder returns**, including plans to recommence dividends, indicates confidence in stabilizing profitability and ROE improvement.",
        "Detailed Analysis of ROE Drivers": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?**  \n  The growth in ROE is not driven by increases in both measures. The **Assets Turnover** has slightly decreased from **3.67** to **3.63**, indicating a minor decline in efficiency. Meanwhile, the **Profit Margin** has sharply declined from a positive **0.0025** to a negative **-0.0007**, showing a deterioration in profitability. This suggests that neither efficiency nor margin is contributing positively to ROE growth, which is a concerning sign.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  Based on the textual report and the ratios, Tesco's **Assets Turnover** remains relatively high, reflecting strong asset utilization. However, the negative **Profit Margin** indicates operational or exceptional cost pressures that have severely dampened profitability. Given the industry context of challenging external factors and increased costs (e.g., business rates, National Living Wage), Tesco\u2019s margin is likely below industry averages, which is not a good sign.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year:** Given the slight decline and Tesco's strategic focus on efficiency, the **Assets Turnover** is expected to stabilize or slightly improve to around **3.65** next year as operational efficiencies take hold.  \n- **Expected Profit Margin next year:** With ongoing cost reduction efforts targeted at PS1.5bn savings and margin improvement plans, the **Profit Margin** is forecasted to recover to a positive level, potentially around **0.0015 - 0.0020**, although still below historical highs.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- Tesco\u2019s **Assets Turnover** remains relatively stable but shows a marginal decline, indicating a modest drop in asset efficiency.  \n- The **Profit Margin** has deteriorated significantly to a negative value, reflecting increased costs, exceptional charges, and operational challenges despite revenue growth.  \n- The **margin** is the weaker driver of ROE, but Tesco\u2019s strategic initiatives focused on cost reduction and profitability suggest a potential margin recovery in the near future.",
        "Detailed Analysis of Risk": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Are risks increasing or declining?**  \n  Overall, risks appear to be **declining**, as shown by the decrease in **NLP financial risk** from **1.2** to **1.05** and a significant drop in **NLP legal risk** from **0.61** to **0.07**. However, **NLP tax risk** has increased moderately from **0.55** to **0.72**, indicating some emerging concerns in tax-related areas.\n\n- **Is the number and severity of risks higher than competitors/industry?**  \n  The textual report highlights challenges such as business rates, historic accounting issues, and regulatory scrutiny, but also notes strong progress on governance and risk management. Without direct competitor data, the **declining legal and financial risk** metrics suggest the company is improving relative to typical industry risks.\n\n- **Is sentiment increasing or declining?**  \n  Sentiment, as implied by the risk-related NLP scores and report tone, is **improving**. The company expresses confidence in progress and future plans, and risk-related sentiment indicators like **NLP legal risk** have sharply reduced, showing a more positive outlook.\n\n- **Is specificity increasing or declining?**  \n  **Specificity is increasing**, with the **NLP specificity** rising from **0.0819** to **0.0970**, indicating more detailed and precise risk disclosures, which enhances transparency.\n\n- **Are complexity measures increasing or declining?**  \n  Complexity has **increased slightly**, with average **sentence length** rising from **26.74** to **28.28** words and **sentence depth** increasing marginally from **6.47** to **6.53**. This suggests more complex language is used in risk disclosures, potentially reflecting more nuanced discussions.\n\n- **How are sentiment, specificity, and complexity compared to competitors?**  \n  While direct competitor comparison is unavailable, the combination of **improving sentiment**, **increased specificity**, and **slightly higher complexity** suggests the company is moving toward **enhanced transparency** and more robust risk communication, likely positioning it favorably within the industry.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Is Gearing expected to increase next year?**  \n  **Yes.** Gearing increased from **3.53** to **4.48**, indicating rising leverage. Given ongoing investments and stable debt levels, gearing is likely to continue increasing unless offset by significant debt reduction.\n\n- **Is Current Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  **Yes.** The current ratio improved slightly from **0.75** to **0.79**, suggesting a marginally better short-term liquidity position, a trend expected to continue with improved cash flow management.\n\n- **Is Quick Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  **Yes.** Quick ratio rose from **0.34** to **0.37**, indicating incremental improvement in liquid asset coverage of current liabilities, likely to continue with ongoing operational improvements.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The company demonstrates **declining financial and legal risks**, indicating effective risk management and resolution of past issues.  \n- There is **increased transparency and precision** in risk disclosures, with **higher specificity** balanced by slightly more complex language, reflecting detailed and nuanced risk communication.  \n- Financially, while **leverage (gearing) is increasing**, short-term liquidity ratios (**current and quick ratios**) show modest improvement, suggesting a cautiously improving liquidity profile amid ongoing investments.  \n- The rising **tax risk** signals an area requiring attention, but overall risk sentiment is positive and improving.  \n- The company\u2019s risk profile and disclosure practices suggest it is **progressing well compared to typical industry challenges**, with a clear focus on strengthening governance and operational resilience.",

Having focused on our three turnaround priorities, we are competitive in the UK again, our balance sheet is more secure, and we continue to rebuild trust by operating with transparency. At the same time, feedback from our customers, colleagues, supplier partners and shareholders continues to improve. We have stabilised our business, and now we are rebuilding profitability. But there is much more we want to do. We must keep listening and innovating: we want to offer truly helpful service: and we need to keep unlocking the power and potential of our colleagues. So we have shared our plans to do that. Our six strategic drivers are not new: they have been guiding our efforts throughout much of the last three years. But taken together, they set a clear direction. Our intention is to become even more competitive for customers, simpler for colleagues, and an even better partner for suppliers, while creating long-term value for our shareholders. At the centre of everything is our purpose: to serve shoppers a little better every day. If we keep putting the customer at the heart of our business, and ask ourselves how we can help serve them a little better every day, we can build on the momentum we are showing. There is still work to do, but this year's performance has demonstrated that every little help really can make a big difference at Tesco. Serving shoppers a little better every day. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 2 Introduction This year has been a significant one for Tesco, where, against a challenging external environment, we have continued to make progress against our purpose: to serve shoppers a little better every day. I am grateful to the management team and Tesco colleagues for all that they have done to deliver this. In October, we shared our plans to create long-term value for stakeholders, and in November, Dave Lewis and the management team invited investors, supplier partners and analysts to Tesco's offices in Welwyn Garden City to hear more about the six strategic drivers at the heart of those plans. This report sets out the progress we are making against each of those drivers and tells the story of how we are building on the strong foundations we laid down in the last few years. Although the business has continued to make significant progress this year, across many of our markets we continue to face a challenging operating environment. In the UK, business rates in particular continue to be a considerable burden, and are the biggest tax we have paid this year. John Allan Non-executive Chairman Building on strong foundations. \" I am very pleased to report another strong year of improvement at Tesco. \" We welcome the fact that the UK Government has committed to reviewing the tax framework and look forward to working with them on this. In terms of the Board's support for Tesco's agenda, we have focused on three areas: 1. corporate governance: 2. helping the business to benefit from the expertise of our Board: and 3. exploring opportunities for future growth. Throughout the year, we have continued to focus on strengthened corporate governance. In July, we appointed a new Non-executive Director, Steve Golsby, who brings a deep knowledge of Asia - in particular Thailand, our largest international market. In January, we were pleased that Deanna Oppenheimer accepted the Board's invitation to become Senior Independent Director. Deanna has a wealth of experience, and succeeds Richard Cousins, who decided to step down from the Board. I would like to thank Richard for his strong contributions to Board deliberations and wish him well for the future. Our emphasis on strong governance also extends to issues we have faced within our business. Last November, our Tesco Bank debit cards were the subject of an online fraudulent attack. We acted quickly to ensure customers' accounts were protected and there was no data loss or breach of systems. Shortly after the end of our 2016 17 financial year, we announced that our subsidiary business, Tesco Stores Limited, had reached an agreement on a Deferred Prosecution Agreement in relation to historic accounting practices, and that we had agreed with the UK Financial Conduct Authority to a finding of market abuse. This brings towards a close a challenging time in Tesco's history. The Board will continue to support Dave and the management team in their efforts to restore trust in the Tesco business and brand. Our second focus has been helping the business to benefit from the expertise of our Board. We have had in-depth reviews of our six strategic drivers and risk management, and we have supported the leadership team on talent development and corporate responsibility. Throughout the year, the Board has considered how Tesco can continue to create long-term value for our stakeholders. That included completing a portfolio review. As a result, we have sold Kipa, our retail business in Turkey: garden centre chain Dobbies: Euphorium bakery: Giraffe restaurants: and Harris Hoole coffee shops. All of these businesses have different strengths and potential, but the sales have allowed Tesco's management team to focus on the areas where Tesco can build on its core competencies and unique strengths to create future growth. This focus has allowed us to announce, in January, a proposed merger with Booker Group. This merger builds on Tesco's core strength as a food business and allows both Tesco and Booker to unlock growth in the UK food market in a way that neither would be able to do alone - in particular by focusing on the fast-growing 'out of home' and 'on the go' food markets, to create the UK's leading food business. Reflecting our improved performance and the Board's confidence in Tesco's future prospects, I am pleased to confirm that we intend to recommence paying dividends in respect of the 2017 18 financial year. We expect dividends to grow progressively from that financial year. We are conscious that the Tesco turnaround is a significant project, but I am confident that with the clear plans and superb talent we have in Dave and the whole Tesco team, there is a huge amount of potential to create sustainable, long-term value for all our stakeholders. John Allan Non-executive Chairman Watch our videos Visit www. com ar2017 to hear more from John Allan. 3 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Chairman's statement Whilst our business continues to face significant external challenges, such as the increasing burden of business rates, National Living Wage and the Apprenticeship Levy in the UK, and greater competitive intensity in Poland, we are making good progress. The energy and commitment of our 460,000 colleagues has enabled us to make further significant improvements to the way we serve our customers, and we have done this at the same time as increasing operating profit before exceptional items by 30% for the Group. In October 2014, we set out our three turnaround priorities and, in 2016, we shared the detail of the six strategic drivers which are driving our mediumand long-term decisions. This Annual Report gives a high-level overview of those six drivers. The strategic drivers are designed to create sustainable value for our four stakeholders in our business: customers, colleagues, supplier partners, and our shareholders. Customers At the heart of everything we do are our customers. In every decision we take, and every plan we develop, we ask ourselves one simple question: will it help serve shoppers a little better every day? In the year, we'five done a lot to strengthen our customer offer. We're continuing to see a sustained improvement in the feedback we're getting from customers on price, service, quality and availability. We continuously innovate to serve our customers better, and this year we have developed 2,422 new products with our supplier partners, as well as reformulating hundreds more products to make them healthier. We'five also made shopping easier for parents by offering free fruit for children in our large stores. Our prices are lower, with a typical basket of products in the UK costing 6% less than in September 2014. We'five also made our offer simpler, for example by cutting multi-buy promotions by a further 24%. At the same time, we have worked hard to remove reasons for customers to shop elsewhere by introducing seven exclusive fresh food brands, alongside our existing Brand Guarantee. Colleagues Every day, our colleagues go the extra mile to help our customers and it is really encouraging to see this coming through in customer feedback, with a continued increase in ratings of colleague helpfulness through the year. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive \" In every decision, we ask ourselves: how will this help serve shoppers a little better?\" Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 4 Group Chief Executive's statement A strong performance. This has been achieved while at the same time changing the way we serve our customers across our channels, as shopping habits change. Many colleagues have been impacted by the changes we have made to management structures and shift routines, including the move from night-time to day-time replenishment. This makes the feedback from customers even more humbling, and a credit to the unwavering commitment of our colleagues in serving shoppers a little better every day. Creating opportunities for colleagues to get on has been a big focus and will continue to be as our business evolves. This year 4,000 colleagues have been promoted or moved to broader roles across the business. We have welcomed over 100 graduates and supported 1,200 apprenticeships and work placements. Supplier partners Strong partnerships with our suppliers mean we can serve our customers better, invest in innovation and grow our businesses together for the long term. This year we have relaunched our online Supplier Network, which now has over 5,000 members. Reflecting the strength of our partnerships, for the first time we topped the independent supplier survey run by Advantage in October, and our own internal Supplier Viewpoint survey shows that 77% of suppliers are positive about their relationship with us. We were also pleased to be recognised by supply chain body GS1 UK, for leading the industry in supporting small British suppliers. Shareholders In order to share more fully our investment case, we have set out more detail on our medium-term ambitions. In particular, we shared our ambition to deliver a Group operating margin of between 3.5% - 4.0% by our 2019 20 financial year, and we have made good progress towards that ambition this year, with a step up from 1.8% to 2.3% in Group operating margin before exceptionals. We have also announced our intention to recommence paying dividends in respect of the 2017 18 financial year, to return value to shareholders in a way which is sustainable for our business. Governance Following the year-end, we announced a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the UK Serious Fraud Office in relation to historic accounting practices, and an agreement with the UK Financial Conduct Authority to a finding of market abuse. Over the last two and a half years, we have fully cooperated with this investigation, while at the same time taking steps to transform our business. What happened in 2014 is a huge source of regret for all of us, and we are determined to maintain and strengthen the changes we have been making to rebuild trust in our business and brand. As well as bringing this matter towards a conclusion, we have made good progress on wider issues of corporate responsibility. We have made a commitment that by the end of 2017, no food that is safe for human consumption will go to waste from our UK retail operations - and this year we have seen a 148% increase in the amount of surplus food donated to people in need. Future growth In January, we announced a proposed merger with Booker Group, to create the UK's leading food business. Bringing together the complementary skills of retail and wholesale businesses will allow us to unlock new opportunities and to better serve customers with a wide range of high-quality affordable food where they want it, when they want it. I'd like to thank all of my colleagues for everything they have done for our customers and our business this year. We have been through some tough years in rebuilding our business, and I'm continually grateful for everything they do. Our goal now is to go even further together. Over the last year we have turned a corner but, as always, we have more to do. We will keep putting the customer at the heart of the business, and we will continue to work openly and transparently with our supplier partners, our colleagues and every shareholder in our business. We will continue to strive to serve our shoppers a little better every day. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive 5 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Our six strategic drivers set out the plans and aspirations which will create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Maximise the mix to achieve a 3.5% - 4.0% Group margin Building sustainable profitability across our businesses, channels and product ranges. A differentiated brand A strong brand creates long-term value. Our purpose, to serve shoppers a little better every day, is at the heart of what our brand stands for. Maximise value from property Our property strategy is about releasing value from our estate, and repurposing space to enhance our customer offer. Reduce operating costs by PS1.5bn We have undertaken a thorough review of our entire cost base, to identify further opportunities for meaningful savings. Innovation Our innovation strategy is driven by expertise and insight in our three differentiating capabilities: Product, Channel and Customer. Generate PS9bn cash from operations Cash is the lifeblood of our business, and we have set a three-year target to generate PS9bn of cumulative retail cash from operations. 7 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Reduce operating costs by PS1.5bn We'five identified PS1.5bn of potential savings for the years to 2019 20, with particular opportunities to simplify the way we run our stores, modernise our distribution and fulfilment networks, and more efficiently procure goods and services not for resale. This year we have generated PS455m of cost savings, of which PS226m contributes to our PS1.5bn target. Goods not for resale - c. PS500m In our day-to-day operations we purchase a wide range of goods and services not for resale, covering everything from marketing to haulage and consumables. Consolidating our spend with our most important supplier partners has allowed us to make substantial savings - for example by reducing our number of haulage partners in Central Europe from 10 down to three, working across the region. Logistics and distribution - c. PS450m Improving stock flow and increasing the efficiency of our supply chains reduces our costs, and also helps us get products to customers faster - so they benefit from fresher food too. As part of this work, we're changing our distribution network - announcing the closure of our distribution centres in Welham Green and Chesterfield - to ensure that the way we distribute food and goods within our business is as simple and cost-effective as possible. Store operating model - c. PS550m Continuing to improve service in store is our absolute priority, and by recalibrating the way we serve customers we have identified opportunities to increase customer satisfaction while also reducing costs. In our UK stores, we have worked with colleagues to ensure that we schedule hours for when our customers need them most, reducing our night operations and moving replenishment to the daytime. A differentiated brand We are on a journey to rebuild trust in our brand, and we have made significant progress. As the brand strengthens, we invest more in those things that make the Tesco brand and experience unique. Our opportunity is to differentiate through our products and services - with great quality at affordable prices, and a unique Tesco offer - and through customer experience, for example by simplifying our systems for ordering online, and delivering consistently great service in store. With our Brand Guarantee, customers don't have to worry about the price of branded products - which they could get from other retailers - and our own-label products become the point of differentiation, with a unique and helpful offer which gives customers a reason to choose Tesco. We take pride in the quality of our food, and that's reflected in our 'Food Love Stories brought to you by Tesco' campaign, which aims to set out our food quality credentials and celebrate the passion and care that goes into the meals we all love. The six strategic drivers continued Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 8 Our world-class store ordering systems have allowed us to simplify backroom procedures in stores - increasing the amount of stock that goes straight from a delivery onto shelves. This ensures great availability for customers, while also reducing the residual stockholding in store and allowing our colleagues to more efficiently manage stock by only handling a product once. Our 88,000 square feet store in Surat Thani was too large, with an overly-broad range that made the shopping trip harder for customers. We took out around 20% of the retail space, creating room for tenants such as Boots and KFC. These bring new income and attract more customers, with a halo effect on our core retail offer and a resulting increase in retail sales density. Maximise the mix to achieve a 3.5% - 4.0% Group margin By improving profitability and optimising working capital, we will generate positive cash from our retail operations. Cash from operations is the biggest contributor to free cash flow, but working capital is a significant opportunity - with better forecasting, and a tighter assortment of products in our distribution centres, we can reduce stock holding and drive working capital benefits. We are also focused on capital discipline to improve free cash flow and have set rigorous hurdle rates for capital allocation, with a focus on payback periods and maximising returns, in order to balance longer-term investments with projects that will more quickly deliver cash. Maximising the mix means looking at the full picture of everything we do to ensure we are delivering great service for our customers, and driving growth in areas which deliver sustainable profits - in order to achieve a 3.5% - 4.0% Group operating margin by our 2019 20 financial year. We serve shoppers through a wide range of channels and services. To ensure we can deliver these sustainably, we work hard to build long-term profitability - by investing in new areas, and by improving the economics of more recent channels, such as Grocery Home Shopping. We follow this approach in all parts of our business, from choosing how we allocate space in our large stores, to looking at the promotional mix we offer to our online customers. 9 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report We have innovated in our ranges, bringing customers great quality meat and produce at affordable prices through our exclusive fresh food brands. Our innovative Free From range also includes many of the products our customers miss most - like our award-winning Free From Garlic Baguette. In March 2017, we were named Free From Retailer of the Year for the third year running. Maximise value from property We have a significant property portfolio, combining both freehold and leasehold assets. We look closely at opportunities to insulate the business from future rental increases, by carefully optimising our freehold and leasehold mix. Repurposing space - in our stores, malls or car parks - allows us to improve sales densities in our larger stores, while also improving our offer for customers. In the UK we have worked with other leading brands to open 49 concessions in our stores this year, with partners including Arcadia Group and Holland & Barrett. We are also exploring opportunities to release value by selling 'air rights' above a small number of our stores in urban areas - working with a developer to build residential properties above or alongside our stores, without capital investment from Tesco. Innovation By listening to shoppers, and looking at broader customer trends, we can drive innovation in both the products we sell, and the channels through which we sell them. Innovation touches everything we do, from the launch of our PayQwiq digital wallet, making the checkout process easier for customers, to our work on reformulation - taking hundreds of tonnes of salt, sugar and fat out of our own-label products to help customers live healthier lives. The strength of the partnerships we have with our suppliers plays an important role in innovation. By building our businesses together, we also give suppliers the confidence to invest in innovative products and solutions for the benefit of our mutual customers. The six strategic drivers continued Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 10 Our business is organised around the three pillars of Customers, Product and Channels. We place customers at the centre of everything we do to deliver our purpose - serving shoppers a little better every day. Reinvest Our focus is always on making Tesco the best it can be for our customers. The better a job we do for customers, the more we will improve sales: the more our sales improve, the more we can reinvest in further improving the shopping trip. Customers Tesco exists to serve customers - listening to them and acting on what is most important to deliver the best possible shopping trip. Product We build close and mutually-beneficial relationships with our supplier partners, to source the best-possible products that meet and anticipate customers' needs. Channels To bring the best products to customers we work through a range of channels - from small shops to large shops, and our growing online business. 11 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Our business model Sales Profit Cash flow PS49.9bn Group sales exc. fuel a 2015 16: PS47.9bn Increasing volume is key to the success of our business model and both volumes and transactions are increasing as customers are buying more products, more often at Tesco.

A detailed analysis of discontinued operations can be found in Note 7. This was a strong performance for Tesco where we delivered results ahead of expectations. We grew sales, excluding VAT, excluding fuel, by 1.1% at constant rates and we saw positive volume growth in both the UK & ROI and International segments. Group operating profit before exceptional items was PS1,280m, up 29.9% on last year as we continue to rebuild profitability whilst investing in the customer offer. Our statutory profit before tax was down 28.2 % to PS145m including PS 263 m of exceptional costs. We generated retail operating cash flow of PS2.3bn, up 9.1% on last year, including a PS387m improvement pre-exceptionals in working capital, and we also reduced net debt excluding Tesco Bank by 27% to PS 3.7 bn. Now that our business has stabilised we have also shared more detail about our clear plans for the coming years. We are well-placed to deliver our ambition of a Group operating margin of 3.5% - 4.0% by the 2019 20 financial year. This ambition is underpinned by six strategic drivers, including the PS1.5bn operating cost reductions which we are on track to secure over the next three years. Reflecting our improved performance and confidence in future prospects, the Board has reviewed our dividend policy. We intend to recommence paying dividends in respect of the financial year 2017 18. We expect dividends to grow progressively from that financial year with the aim of achieving a target cover of around two times earnings per share over the medium term. \" This was a strong performance for Tesco where we delivered results ahead of expectations. \" com ar2017 to find PDF and Excel downloads of our financial statements. Alan Stewart Chief Financial Officer Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 14 Profit recovery continues. In the UK and the Republic of Ireland ROI, we have now seen five consecutive quarters of like-for-like sales growth. In the UK, volumes grew 1.6% and transactions grew 1.7% as we continued to make fundamental improvements to all aspects of our offer. We saw annual positive like-for-like growth for the first time in seven years and outperformed the market across all categories on a volume basis. Volume outperformance was particularly strong in fresh food, where the exclusive brands we launched in March 2016 have helped to significantly strengthen our value proposition. Significant product cost deflation in the first half of the year eased in the second half. In collaboration with our supplier partners, we have worked hard to minimise the impact of emerging inflationary cost pressures. Despite some inflation in a number of categories, the price of a typical customer basket remains around 6% cheaper than in September 2014 and promotional participation has fallen to 32% as we made a conscious decision to focus our investments on sustainable improvements rather than on short-term couponing and promotions. We achieved improvements in all key customer metrics, including colleague helpfulness and availability, where performance reached record levels. In the Republic of Ireland, like-for-like sales fell by 0.1 % as we continued to invest in lowering prices. We have a leading position in the market in volume terms and have further grown volume share by making improvements across our customer offer, with a focus on fresh produce, meat and bakery. Our full-year UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items was PS803m, up 60% on last year, with margin growth of 68 basis points year-on-year. This improvement includes the impact of investments we have made in all aspects of our offer, particularly in lowering core prices and in the quality and price of the exclusive fresh food brands which we launched in March 2016. These investments enabled us to drive volume growth, generating positive operational leverage. In addition to managing costs more effectively year-on-year, we are also optimising the mix of our offer across channels and products. For example, within our beers, wines and spirits category we have focused on improving the relevance and profitability of our offer by broadening our range of speciality beers, increasing the prominence of own brand products and maintaining a strong, stable core price position in an extremely promotional market.

International sales growth weakened in the second half due to an increasingly competitive environment in Europe, particularly Poland, and as we annualised a strong performance last year in Asia. In the year, we grew like-for-like sales strongly in Thailand as we invested in both lowering prices and improving our fresh food proposition. We grew market share and were pleased to retain our number one position for customers for brand and trust a. In Malaysia, top-line sales growth was held back by weak consumer spending across the market and a trend away from large stores towards convenience shopping, where we are currently under-represented. In Central Europe, like-for-like sales grew in all markets apart from Poland which remains intensely competitive. Positive volume growth in the region was driven by a strong performance in fresh food where we improved quality and inspired customers with new ranges and events.

Whilst we continued to invest in our offer in all of our markets, our response to intense competition in Poland weighed on profitability in Central Europe. We continued to focus on improving our store economics across the region, including simplifying management structures, reducing store administration and closing unprofitable store counters. We also opened a new distribution centre at Poznan in Poland, reducing transport costs for the country by 20%. From April 2017, we have separated the management of our international business, creating two new Executive Committee roles leading Asia and Central Europe, giving greater focus to each region. The introduction of a new retail tax in Poland remains suspended pending the outcome of the European Commission's investigation. We continue to be cautious about potential legislative changes in our European markets. Tesco Bank 2016 17 2015 16 Year-on-year change Revenue PS1,012m PS955m 6.0% Operating profit before exceptional items PS157m PS162m 3.1 % Operating profit PS77m PS161m 52.2 % Lending to customers PS9,961m PS8,542m 16.6% Customer deposits PS8,463m PS7,397m 14.4% Net interest margin 4.0% 4.2% 0.2 % Risk asset ratio 20.0% 20.0% - Tesco Bank continues to provide a simple and transparent product offer to serve the banking and insurance needs of Tesco customers. Active customer account numbers grew by 3.5%, with particularly strong growth in current accounts. We have continued to improve our customer offer by introducing a new premium credit card, simplifying the loan application process by introducing digital signatures, giving interest rate guarantees on current accounts for new and existing customers and through a national roll-out of PayQwiq to all large stores, a digital wallet app that allows customers to pay with their phone in our shops. Operating profit before exceptional items reduced by 3.1 % to PS157m. This decline was due to the full year effect of the introduction of European Commission caps on interchange income which first came into effect in December 2015. Adjusting for this impact, we saw strong profit growth driven primarily by lending income. Exceptional items of PS 80 m relating to Tesco Bank include an increase in the provision for customer redress and a restructuring charge. Risk-weighted assets have risen in line with lending and the Core Tier 1 ratio has improved to 16.7%. The balance sheet remains strong and well-positioned to support future lending growth from both a liquidity and capital perspective. Exceptional items in operating profit 2016 17 2015 16 Net impairment of non-current assets and onerous lease provisions PS 6 m PS 423 m Net restructuring and redundancy costs PS 199 m PS 126 m Provision for customer redress PS 45 m - Interchange settlement PS57m - Property transactions PS165m PS156m Provision for SFO and FCA obligations PS 235 m - Past service credit and associated costs arising on UK defined benefit pension scheme closure - PS480m Total exceptional items in operating profit PS 263 m PS87m Exceptional items are excluded from our headline performance measures by virtue of their size and nature, in order to reflect management's view of the performance of the Group. In the current year, the net effect of exceptional items on operating profit is PS 263 m. Our annual impairment testing resulted in a net charge of PS 6 m. This comprises a net PS103m provision release relating to property, a net increase of PS 56 m in onerous lease provisions and a net PS 53 m impairment charge in goodwill and intangible assets, principally relating to dunnhumby subsidiary, Sociomantic. Net restructuring and redundancy charges of PS 199 m relate principally to changes to our distribution network and store colleague structures and working practices in the UK & ROI, and also includes a PS 35 m charge relating to Tesco Bank business simplification. The provision for customer redress of PS 45 m was recognised in Tesco Bank in the first half, following updated guidance published by the Financial Conduct Authority, proposing an extension to the Payment Protection Insurance settlement deadline which is now set at August 2019. Exceptional items include a credit of PS57m in relation to a legal settlement in respect of interchange fees. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 16 Financial review continued We generated net profits pre-tax of PS165m from property transactions in the year, of which PS91m related to the sale of the Letnany Shopping Mall and Liberec Forum Shopping Centre in the Czech Republic. We also sold a number of properties and development sites in the UK & ROI business. An exceptional charge of PS 235 m has been recorded as an adjusting post balance sheet event, following judicial approval on 10 April 2017 of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement between Tesco Stores Limited and the UK Serious Fraud Office regarding historic accounting practices and an agreement with the UK Financial Conduct Authority of a finding of market abuse in relation to the Tesco PLC trading statement announced on 29 August 2014. Joint ventures and associates, interest and tax Joint ventures and associates Losses from joint ventures and associates before exceptional items increased by PS 9 m to PS 30 m, due to lower profits recognised in our UK property joint ventures. After exceptional items, including an impairment of investment property within Gain Land, our associate in China, and an adjustment in insurance reserves in Tesco Underwriting, our share of post-tax losses from joint ventures and associates rose to PS 107 m from PS 21 m last year. Finance income and costs 2016 17 2015 16 Interest receivable and similar income PS48m PS29m IAS 32 and 39 'Financial instruments' - fair value remeasurements PS61m - Finance income PS109m PS29m Interest payable PS 523 m PS 490 m Capitalised interest PS6m PS6m IAS 32 and 39 'Financial instruments' - fair value remeasurements - PS 19 m IAS 19 net pension finance costs PS 113 m PS 155 m Finance costs PS 630 m PS 658 m Exceptional charge: Translation of Korea proceeds PS 244 m PS 220 m Statutory finance costs PS 874 m PS 878 m Finance income rose to PS109m, mainly due to the favourable effect of marking-to-market financial instruments. These are non-cash adjustments driven by changes in the market's assessment of credit and debt risk. Interest payable increased to PS 523 m due to debt acquired as part of our February 2016 agreement to regain sole ownership of 49 stores and two distribution centres. The impact of this was partially offset by a PS26m reduction in interest following the repayment of debt in the year. Net pension finance costs of PS 113 m reduced in line with the reduction in the opening IAS 19 pension deficit at the start of the 2016 17 financial year. Net pension finance costs are calculated by multiplying the opening net deficit by the opening discount rate each year. For 2017 18, they are expected to increase to c. PS 165 m. An exceptional non-cash loss of PS 244 m arose on the translation of the proceeds from the sale of our Homeplus business in Korea which were held in GBP money market funds in a non-Sterling denominated subsidiary. This does not represent any economic cost to the Group. Group tax Tax on profit before exceptional items was PS 185 m with an effective rate of tax for the Group of 25%. This tax rate is higher than the UK statutory rate primarily due to the impact of the 8% supplementary tax surcharge on bank profits, introduced in January 2016, and depreciation of assets that does not qualify for tax relief. The tax rate benefited from the impact on deferred tax of the expected reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% in 2020. On a statutory basis, including an exceptional credit of PS98m principally relating to a lower book value than tax value of property disposals and tax relief on exceptional impairment and restructuring costs, the tax charge was PS 87 m. The effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items for the 2017 18 financial year is expected to be similar to this year, at around 25%. Earnings per share on a continuing operations basis Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items and net pension finance costs were 7.90p, 41% higher year-on-year principally due to our stronger profit performance. Statutory basic earnings per share from continuing operations were 0.81p, lower than last year driven by higher net exceptional costs. 17 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Summary of total indebtedness 2016 17 2015 16 Movement Net debt excludes Tesco Bank PS 3,729 m PS 5,110 m PS1,381m Discounted operating lease commitments PS 7,440 m PS 7,814 m PS374m Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax PS 5,504 m PS 2,612 m PS 2,892 m Total indebtedness PS 16,673 m PS 15,536 m PS 1,137 m Net debt excluding Tesco Bank reduced by PS1.4bn to PS 3.7 bn, as our retail operating cash flow and property and business disposal proceeds were greater than capital expenditure and other charges. We have a strong funding and liquidity profile underpinned by PS4.4bn committed facilities and our key credit metrics fixed charge cover, net debt EBITDA and total indebtedness ratio have improved over the year. Discounted operating lease commitments The reduction in discounted operating lease commitments includes a benefit from the buybacks we have completed in the UK. In the year, we regained sole ownership of 16 superstores from a number of different vendors, resulting in an annual rent saving of PS22m. Pension The IAS 19 pension deficit measure, which relates to our closed UK defined benefit scheme, increased by PS 2.9 bn to PS 5.5 bn due to the reduction in bond yields. Despite this increase in the IAS 19 measure of our liabilities, the actual pension payments that are payable to members in the future have not changed. During the year, we completed a fide-risking programme which has reduced the future volatility of the scheme's long-term funding. At the last triennial valuation, the Trustee and the Company agreed a long-term funding plan where the Company is paying contributions of PS270m a year to the UK defined benefit scheme. The next triennial actuarial valuation is effective as at 31 March 2017 and work is already underway. The Trustee is aiming to conclude the valuation as soon as is reasonably possible. Summary retail cash flow 2016 17 2015 16 Cash flow from continuing operations excluding working capital PS1,695m PS2,033m Increase decrease in working capital underlying decrease in working capital PS387m PS377m impact from exceptional items PS197m PS 91 m cash impact of new approach to supplier payments - PS 231 m Cash generated from operations - continuing operations PS2,279m PS2,088m Cash generated from operations - discontinued operations PS 1 m PS493m Cash generated from operations PS2,278m PS2,581m Interest paid PS 518 m PS 422 m Corporation tax paid received PS 64 m PS125m Net cash generated from retail operating activities PS1,696m PS2,284m Cash capital expenditure PS 1,328 m PS 1,004 m Free cash flow PS368m PS1,280m Other investing activities PS1,620m PS543m Net cash used in from financing activities and intra-Group funding and intercompany transactions PS 1,342 m PS 854 m Net increase in cash and cash equivalents PS646m PS969m Include exclude cash movements in debt items PS1,114m PS4,219m Fair value and other non-cash movements PS 379 m PS 1,817 m Movement in net debt PS1,381m PS3,371m On an underlying basis, working capital improved by PS387m driven by growing sales volumes, initiatives to reduce stockholding and the timing effect of a fuel payment. The reported total reduction in working capital also includes the net impact of exceptional items. Excluding working capital, we generated PS1.7bn of cash from continuing retail operations. The decrease of PS 0.3 bn on the previous year primarily reflects the payment of a turnaround bonus to colleagues in cash rather than shares and higher net exceptional costs than last year. Interest paid was PS 96 m higher than last year due to the debt acquired as part of our February 2016 agreement to regain sole ownership of 49 stores and two distribution centres. The impact of this was partially offset by PS1.2bn of debt we redeemed in September 2016 and a further PS0.7bn of debt we redeemed in January 2017. The cash tax outflow of PS 64 m reflects payments by our international businesses which more than offset a refund of taxes already paid in the UK, as we continue to agree and close historic enquiries into tax returns. Cash movements of PS1.1bn in debt items primarily reflect the redemption of three medium-term notes on their maturity. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 18 Financial review continued Capital expenditure 2016 17 2015 16 UK & ROI PS731m PS676m International PS403m PS254m Tesco Bank PS46m PS40m Group PS1,180m PS970m Capital expenditure excluding buybacks of PS1.2bn was PS0.2bn higher than last year reflecting our planned increase in spend to refresh more than 200 stores in the UK and to accelerate the store opening programme in Thailand. We now expect Group capital expenditure to be around PS1.25bn in 2017 18. This is around PS250m below our original estimate, as we continue to focus on capital spend that delivers attractive returns and move more of our planned technology spend to cloud-based services. There was a net reduction of 2.2 m square feet, which includes 1.7 m square feet related to the disposal of Dobbies garden centres with the balance being net closures of space. In Asia we opened 114 stores, primarily in our convenience format in Thailand. In Europe we closed 23 stores. This year we repurposed just over 1.0m square feet across the Group, improving the ease and relevance of the shopping trip for customers. This included 0.5m square feet in Thailand repurposed for new and existing partners, including five new branches of Decathlon Sports, exclusive in the market to Tesco Lotus, and four new cinemas. In the UK, we repurposed 0.1m square feet in 14 stores, introducing brands such as Miss Selfridge, Wallis and Holland & Barrett. Property 2016 17 2015 16 UK & ROI International Group UK & ROI International Group Property a - fully owned Estimated market value PS13.1bn PS6.7bn PS19.9bn PS13.3bn PS6.4bn PS19.7bn Net book value b PS12.6bn PS5.1bn PS17.8bn PS12.6bn PS5.0bn PS17.6bn % net selling space owned 52% 74% 63% 52% 71% 61% % total property owned - by value c 50% 78% 57% 47% 75% 54% a Stores, malls, investment property, offices, distribution centres, fixtures and fittings and work-in-progress. b Property, plant and equipment excluding vehicles. The estimated market value of our fully owned property has increased by PS0.2bn to PS19.9bn, retaining a surplus of PS2.1bn over the net book value, as the repurchase of 16 stores in the UK and a foreign exchange translation effect more than offset the impact of the sale of Turkey and Dobbies garden centres. Our Group freehold property ownership percentage, by value, has increased from 54% to 57% year-on-year, driven by both the UK & ROI and International. In International, the effect of the sale of our business in Turkey more than offset the impact of the sale of two large freehold shopping centres in the Czech Republic on the mix of freehold to leasehold. In April 2017, we regained ownership of a further seven large stores in the UK with a freehold valuation of PS219m in a transaction with British Land. Including the effect of this transaction, we have now increased our proportion of freehold ownership by value in the UK & ROI to 51%, up by 10% over two years. The repurchase of stores to date has resulted in an annualised saving of PS152m rent, predominantly in relation to fixed-uplift and index-linked rental agreements. The Group operating lease charge reduced by 9% in the year to PS1.0bn. We continue to seek opportunities to further reduce our exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift rent inflation where the economics are attractive. Looking ahead We made good progress over the last year, further strengthening our customer offer and delivering an improvement in profitability a little ahead of expectations. We are confident in the plans we have shared and in the progress we will make this year, including further steps towards reducing our costs by PS1.5bn, generating PS9bn retail cash from operations and improving Group operating margin to between 3.5% and 4.0% by 2019 20. With a much more competitive offer and supplier partnerships as strong as they have ever been, we are much better positioned to navigate challenging market conditions. In January, we announced that we had agreed the terms of a proposed merger with Booker, focused on unlocking new growth, particularly in the faster-growing 'out of home' food market. We are continuing to engage as planned with the Competition and Markets Authority in advance of seeking shareholder approval for the transaction, anticipated in late 2017 early 2018.

This dual improvement indicates a very positive development, reflecting enhanced operational efficiency alongside improved profitability.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  While the textual report does not provide explicit competitor or industry benchmarks, Tesco\u2019s continued sales growth, improved operating margins, and increased cash flow generation imply that their **efficiency** and **margin** improvements are competitive within the retail sector. The improvement in asset turnover suggests better utilization of assets compared to prior periods, which is favorable in a highly competitive retail market.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year:** Given the ongoing focus on operational efficiency, store optimization, and digital channels, it is reasonable to forecast a further modest increase in **Asset Turnover** to approximately **5.3**.\n- **Expected Profit Margin next year:** With continued cost reductions, focus on profitable sales mix, and margin expansion in key markets, the **Profit Margin** is expected to improve further to around **2.2%**.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- Tesco\u2019s ROE growth is strongly supported by improvements in both **Asset Turnover** and **Profit Margin**, representing an effective balance between operational efficiency and profitability enhancement.\n- The increase in **Asset Turnover** from **4.23** to **5.08** indicates better asset utilization, which is particularly important given the retail industry's capital intensity.\n- The improved **Profit Margin** from **1.72%** to **2.07%** reflects successful cost savings, better sales mix, and ongoing turnaround initiatives.\n- Tesco\u2019s strategic decisions, such as store format optimization, expansion of Own Brand products, and cost base reduction, are driving these positive trends.\n- The company\u2019s ability to generate strong retail operating cash flow (PS2.5bn) and reduce indebtedness further supports sustainable margin and efficiency gains.\n- Continued innovation and market repositioning in the UK and international segments underpin the forecasted growth in both efficiency and profitability.\n- Risks remain from external factors such as Brexit and competitive pressures, but Tesco\u2019s focus on long-term value creation mitigates these.\n- Overall, Tesco is positioned to maintain and possibly accelerate improvements in ROE drivers, enhancing shareholder value.\n- The stronger driver currently appears to be **Asset Turnover**, supported by strategic operational efficiency initiatives.\n- Profit Margin improvements complement efficiency gains, positioning Tesco well for continued financial performance improvements.",

Retail has changed a lot in that time, and so has our business. \" Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive Group Chief Executive's review This year has been an important milestone for Tesco. In 2019, we are celebrating 100 years since Jack Cohen first set up his East London market stall - and reiterating our commitments to great value for customers. It's also an important milestone in the turnaround that we began in 2015, and which we are successfully delivering - and I'm confident we will finish the job in 2019 20. After four years of turnaround, we have made significant progress. We have transformed the Tesco brand: significantly reduced our cost base: generated PS2.5bn of retail operating cash this year, and achieved a Group operating margin for the full year of 3.45% - reaching 3.96% in the second half of the year. We have also released PS1.7bn of value from our property portfolio since the start of our turnaround, and built a culture of innovation. Our balance sheet is stronger too, with total indebtedness of PS 22 bn in 2015 reduced to PS 12 bn at the end of this year. Importantly, the progress we are making is broad-based. In the UK, we have rebuilt the competitiveness of our offer: in Central Europe, we have simplified our business and delivered a significant cost reduction programme: and in Asia, we have successfully renegotiated terms with our suppliers, supporting our profit recovery. This strong financial performance is driven by a strategic decision to manage our business with a long-term focus on four key metrics: customer satisfaction, cash profitability, free cash flow and earnings growth. It also reflects the plans we have delivered this year to create value for each of our key stakeholders - our customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders. We have continued our focus on providing customers with quality products at great prices. Our customers' perceptions of quality and value have continued to improve throughout our turnaround, and more customers are recommending Tesco as a place to shop. Our customer offer is stronger, with almost 10,000 Own Brand products relaunched in the UK. Importantly, this includes completing the roll-out of our entry-level product tier in the UK, introducing eight new 'Exclusively at Tesco' brands. These products offer exceptional value and customers are responding very positively. In Asia, we have launched almost 600 new Own Brand products, with positive customer feedback and an increase in Own Brand sales participation in both Thailand and Malaysia. We continue to help our customers who want to make healthier choices and in September, through our health event in UK stores - our first in partnership with Jamie Oliver - we offered a basket of 'helpful little swaps' which was 12% cheaper than a standard basket. As part of our centenary celebrations, we have also launched a new store format in the UK, Jack's - which proudly supports Britain's food producing communities, with eight out of ten Jack's branded food and drink products grown, reared or made in Britain - and offers customers a no-fuss approach, with a low-cost business model. In Central Europe, we have launched 'Star Lines', with more than 600 products benchmarked on quality and price against the market, so that customers can shop with confidence. We have also continued our Food Love Stories campaign, sharing our passion for food and showcasing the quality of our products. And at Tesco Bank, we have launched new technology to simplify banking for customers, including an improved mobile app, which is now the preferred method of account access for 1.2 million customers. com ar2019 to hear more from Dave Lewis. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 3 Strategic report Colleagues. We want Tesco to be a great place to work for all of our colleagues, and to make it easier for them to do what they do best - serving our shoppers. In November, we implemented the final stage of a 10.5% pay increase for our hourly-paid UK store colleagues. We have a consistent principle that we aim to pay all colleagues competitively against the relevant pay benchmark. Last year, we launched our National Charity Partnership, bringing together three of the UK's leading health charities: Cancer Research UK, the British Heart Foundation and Diabetes UK. Through that partnership, we are helping our colleagues to lead healthier lives, and this year we conducted the UK's largest ever workplace health survey, with more than 8,000 colleagues taking part. More than 20,000 colleagues have also benefited from e-learning to support mental wellbeing. We are committed to offering good career opportunities, and this year over 1,000 colleagues took part in one of our apprenticeship programmes, supporting existing Tesco colleagues to develop new skills and helping young people start their career. In Ireland, we were particularly pleased to be independently recognised as a top Irish workplace for a second year, as well as being named one of the best workplaces for women, reflecting our aim to give everyone an equal opportunity to get on. Tesco continues to be a place where people can develop, and access a huge breadth of opportunity. However, this has also been a significant year of change for our business, which has had an impact on our colleagues. These changes are necessary as we respond to changes in the way that customers shop with us, and will ensure that we are operating our business sustainably. Whenever we make any change in our business, our priority is always to support our colleagues, and to stay true to our values. No one tries harder for customers We treat people how they want to be treated Every little help makes a big difference Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 4 Suppliers. We continue to strengthen the partnerships we have with our suppliers. For a third successive year, we ranked first in the independent supplier Advantage survey, and our Supplier Viewpoint measure for the Group reached a high of 77.5% in the second half of the year. Our close, trusted partnerships with suppliers allow us to deliver great quality products to our customers, at great value. We are committing to long-term strategic relationships with our closest supplier partners, supporting them to invest in improving the value and quality of our products, and increasing the efficiency of our supply chain. This year we have also worked together with our suppliers to make sensible preparations for Brexit, seeking to protect service and availability for our customers. As we grow our business, that presents an opportunity for our partners to grow with us too. Through our merger with Booker, suppliers can access the combined growth of a Group which serves not just the retail market, but also wholesale and food eaten 'out of home'. Our alliance with Carrefour presents a further opportunity for growth, covering the strategic relationship with global suppliers, the joint purchasing of Own Brand products and goods not for resale. We're also working with suppliers to make products healthier and more sustainable. In Thailand, we became the first retailer to bring all our Own Brand soft drinks below 6g of sugar per 100ml and we have removed trans fats from all Tesco bakery items. In the UK, we have worked with our suppliers to remove more than 2,900 tonnes of hard to recycle materials from our Own Brand products. 358 suppliers worked with us to develop 1,800 products for our new Jack's brand Alternative performance measures referred to in this statement are defined in the Glossary on pages 178 to 181. 5 Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 Group Chief Executive's review continued Shareholders. We continue to create long-term, sustainable value for shareholders, investing in our competitiveness in all of our markets and being more selective in the mix of products we sell, moving away from loss-making categories. We have made a number of key decisions to support this, including the closure of Tesco Direct, stepping back from unprofitable general merchandise sales in Central Europe, and an accelerated transformation plan in Asia. We are delivering the synergies from our merger with Booker, with PS79m realised in this first year, and we are well on track to meet our target recurring run-rate of around PS200m per year by the end of the third year. Our Joining Forces programme continues at pace, with top Booker products now available in 70 Tesco stores and, for Booker customers, a significant improvement in the quality of the top 20 fastest-selling retail fruit and vegetable lines. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, reducing total indebtedness and lowering our interest costs. Reflecting our strong underlying financial performance, we are also proposing a final dividend of 4.10 pence, taking the full-year dividend to 5.77 pence, an increase of 92.3% year-on-year. We now expect to reach a dividend cover level of around two times earnings on a post-IFRS 16 basis in the 2019 20 financial year. It has been a strong year for Tesco, and the strategic decisions we have made are allowing us to grow our business sustainably. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our colleagues in delivering our plans, we have already met the vast majority of our turnaround objectives. This puts us in a good position to further invest in our competitiveness, and to face into challenging conditions in each of our markets, including: - the unlevel playing field created by the business rates system in the UK, which continues to place a significant burden on the retail industry, with our own bill at around PS700m each year: - changes to Sunday trading regulations in Poland which have impacted sales for Central Europe, contributing to a 2.3 % sales decline: and - the market in Thailand - which is highly competitive and challenging - and the issuance of government welfare cards, which had an impact of 1.2 % on Asia sales this year, although this had eased by the end of the fourth quarter. While these and other headwinds will continue, we will succeed by staying true to what we have always done best throughout our 100-year history: being a champion for customers. 6 More detail on our performance, including statutory results, can be found in our Financial review on pages 18 to 23. That means offering great value, the best quality, and helpful service. Jack Cohen did exactly that when he first set out his market stall, and the same spirit still drives Tesco today. It also means creating value in a wider sense, for communities and for society. We are committed to tackling the issues that matter - setting targets and measuring our progress against them. This year we have: - achieved 81% of our target that no food that is safe for human consumption should go to waste in our UK business: - donated the equivalent of 62.7 million meals to local charities and community groups in the UK, Ireland, Central Europe and Asia, and also launched a training programme with a goal to help more than 1,000 community cooks in the UK make the most of the donations they receive: - increased sales of healthy products by 17% year-on-year in our September 2018 'helpful little swaps' event: and - begun trials of a 'reverse vending' scheme for plastic bottles in the UK and Thailand. We are also partnering with external organisations, working together with shared ambitions. This year we have launched a new partnership with WWF, with the aim of reducing the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket by 50%. We are making good progress in each of the areas of our Little Helps Plan, and we want to go even further to achieve our goal of providing customers with affordable, healthy, sustainable food. One hundred years of great value. Over the last 100 years, Tesco has been an innovator, a disruptor, and above all it has listened to customers - meeting their needs better than anybody else. Retail has changed a lot in that time, and so has our business. From bringing self-service supermarkets to the UK, fighting against Resale Price Maintenance, delivering the first-ever online food shop or rewarding loyalty through Clubcard, Tesco has always been at its best when we are doing the right thing for customers. That has been the guiding principle of our four years of turnaround, and it continues to guide every decision we make today. As we celebrate our centenary, we are in a strong position. It's a moment to reflect on our past - but also to look ahead to the future. And as we do so, our focus is clear: to create long-term, sustainable value for every stakeholder in our business, for many years to come. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 7 Strategic report Jack's first store: In 1929, Jack set up shop in North London under the Tesco name. Tesco comes from the initials 'TES' of T. E. Stockwell, a tea supplier and partner of Jack's, as well as the 'CO' from Jack's surname. 1920s Celebrating 100 years of great value A born entrepreneur: Jack Cohen founded Tesco in 1919. Jack took his PS30 demob money at the end of the First World War, bought some surplus army food and got himself a pitch. By the end of that first morning he'd taken PS4, of which PS1 was his own. And he worked hard to give customers what they needed. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 8 A lot has changed since Jack Cohen set up his market stall in 1919, but not our commitment to great value. We're proud to be celebrating our centenary, promising great value for customers, colleagues and communities. 9 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 Strategic report Celebrating 100 years of great value. Fighting for customers: When Britain went to war in 1939, this time Jack fought on the home front, for fair food rationing. He worked with Government on a simple points system, where everyone was treated equally, rich or poor. Checkout at Tesco: We closed our stores and took the competition by surprise with the launch of a major price-cutting initiative called 'Checkout at Tesco'. Our simple, low prices were an overnight success. Value at the pumps and a legacy to remember: We changed the rules of fuel retailing, as we opened our first Tesco petrol stations - giving customers another great reason to shop with us. But it was also the end of an era, as Jack Cohen passed away in 1979. Something for nothing: We introduced Green Shield stamps in 1963, and they soon became a national phenomenon. These stamps could be exchanged for a range of goods in our Green Shield catalogue, giving customers even better value at Tesco. 1930s 1970s 1977 1960s Jack is back: We unveiled a new brand and stores, inspired by and named after Jack Cohen. Jack's brings customers great-tasting food at the lowest possible prices. Our centenary: We celebrate one hundred years of great value. Life in Britain has changed a lot since Jack made his first sale but today, serving shoppers better still starts with selling great quality food at affordable prices. In our centenary year, we're doing that in more ways than ever with exceptional deals that take customers back. More ways to shop: By 2000, technology had moved on a lot since our first home delivery in 1984 - and so had our business. com, which today serves millions of customers every month. In the same decade, we also launched our F&F clothing brand and Tesco Bank. The game changers: We launched our iconic 'Every Little Helps' strapline, in a decade full of little helps for our customers - from the introduction of Clubcard, to the launch of our first Express and Extra stores, making it even more convenient for customers to shop with us. We also launched our Tesco Value range, offering our customers a wider choice of products at great prices. 1990s 2018 2000s 2019 UK & ROI Central Europe Asia Tesco Bank 79% 11% 8% 2% Group sales PS56,883m We're passionate about serving shoppers a little better every day, in store and online.

A strong and differentiated brand creates long-term value for every stakeholder in our business. Our purpose, to serve shoppers a little better every day, is at the heart of what our brand stands for. As we celebrate our centenary year, we are looking back to the ethos of our founder, Jack Cohen, and what made Tesco unique: his unwavering, simple commitment to great value. That same commitment remains true today, and throughout 2019 we are doing that in more ways than ever before, with exceptional deals that take customers back, through our 'One Hundred Years of Great Value' campaign. This year we have made further progress in our relaunch of more than 10,000 Own Brand products - the largest launch of its kind in our 100-year history - bringing our customers great quality products at the very best prices. We have also continued our awardwinning Food Love Stories campaign, highlighting the quality of our food and showcasing the care that goes into every one of our products. Encouragingly, customers and stakeholders continue to recognise our efforts, and this year our YouGov BrandIndex score reached its highest rating since October 2011. To ensure that our business remains sustainable for the long term, we continue to simplify the way we operate and reduce our costs. We delivered in-year cost savings of PS532m, with PS1.4bn of savings to date towards our PS1.5bn ambition. Reducing our costs is particularly important as we face into challenging conditions in each of our markets across the Group, so that we can be even more competitive, and offer customers the value, quality and service that they expect. We are simplifying our store operations, improving stock flow, and further improving our forecasting to reduce waste. In our Express stores, we have optimised our distribution and replenishment by adjusting case sizes, reducing handling and transport costs. We have also taken the difficult decision to close around 90 of our fresh food counters in the UK, with the remaining 700 trading with either a full or flexible offer. This reflects changes to the way customers shop in these stores, and will allow us to operate more sustainably for the long term. In Central Europe, we have reduced costs by simplifying work for colleagues in stores - for example by reducing the number of price changes by almost a third. We maintain a strategic focus on generating free cash flow, and this year generated PS2.5bn of retail operating cash, driven by improved profitability. Strong working capital management is also a key component of our cash generation. Retail operating cash flow for this year is reported after a c. PS 490 m working capital timing impact year-on-year. This includes a year-on-year timing impact of PS 278 m relating to delayed payments following the failure of a key supplier, Palmer & Harvey, at the end of the last financial year. A further PS 210 m impact relates to decisions made in the second half of the year. Most significantly, the delayed implementation of a new general ledger system in the UK & ROI postponed the collection of some receivables into the beginning of the 2019 20 financial year. In addition, a focus on safeguarding availability and service levels for customers at a time of political uncertainty meant we deprioritised certain ongoing working capital initiatives. Over the last three years we have generated PS8.6bn of retail operating cash. Reduce operating costs by PS1.5bn Generate PS9bn cash from operations Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 14 4. Across the Group, we are working on mix - making our business more sustainable, and stepping back from unprofitable sales. Group operating margin for the year was 3.45%, up 59 basis points. In the second half of the year, on the same basis as our ambition excluding Booker, Group operating margin was 3.79%. We have taken some significant decisions to strengthen our mix, including the closure of our loss-making general merchandise website, Tesco Direct, where we saw no route to profitability. In Central Europe, we remain focused on building a more sustainable business. In Poland, we closed 62 unprofitable stores in the year, and we are reducing the costs of operating our business as we focus on profitable sales. We have also introduced more than 600 'Star Lines' for customers across our four Central European markets, giving more space on the shelf to the most popular products, at sharper prices. In Asia, we have repositioned our customer offer in Thailand, with significant changes to our sales mix and promotional strategy, as well as accelerating changes to our operating model, which are helping to underpin our profit recovery. We will continue to look at opportunities to improve our mix, allowing us to become more competitive for customers, and to deliver strong, sustainable returns for shareholders. This year we released a further PS285m of value from our property portfolio across the Group. In the UK, we are continuing to explore a small number of opportunities to work with a third-party to redevelop our store sites in high-value locations. For example, this year, working with a selected development partner, we have created a plan which will transform our store in Kennington, London. As well as making better use of the space to create hundreds of new homes, the project will also deliver a brand new Tesco store, further commercial space and will open up the site, bringing communities in the local area closer together. We continue to repurpose space in some of our larger stores, introducing thirdparty concessions from popular brands, as well as services like barbers. In Central Europe, we have simplified our property portfolio as we exit our department store format. We have also repurposed space in 14 of our hypermarkets, and introduced 22 new anchor tenants into our malls. We completed three property buybacks in the year in the UK, and our proportion of freehold property across the Group has remained stable year-on-year at 58%. A continuous pipeline of innovation ensures that we can keep serving shoppers better - anticipating and responding to their needs better than anybody else. Creating a culture of innovation across our business remains a priority and, to support this, we opened a new facility this year at our Welwyn Garden City campus. The 'Heart' building brings together our capabilities in product development, customer insight, colleague learning and retail technology - including a state of the art Express store, and kitchens where our colleagues and supplier partners can develop new products together. We're also innovating to make our products healthier, and more sustainable. When we reformulate products, wherever possible we make them healthier, without compromising on taste. This year we have added extra fibre to chilled breads and savouries, and reduced the sugar in our core Own Brand baked beans by 20%. We'five launched new packaging to reduce our impact on the environment and prevent waste, like our avocado packs, which now stay fresher for two days longer. As the way people shop continues to change, we are also innovating in the way we serve them. We'five launched a new brand in the UK - Jack's - as part of our centenary celebrations. In Thailand, we have also launched a new convenience proposition, to better meet our customers' needs.

Sustainable growth in sales is important to our business model. A strong, growing business also creates opportunities for our suppliers to grow with us too. Group sales is a measure of revenue excluding sales made at petrol filling stations. It demonstrates the Group's underlying performance in the core retail and financial services businesses by removing the volatilities associated with the movement in fuel prices. Group sales grew by 11.3% at constant exchange rates to PS56.9bn, and this year was our third consecutive year of sales growth. Booker was consolidated into the Group for 51 weeks from 5 March, contributing 11.4% to Group sales growth. Our key performance indicators Our Big 6 KPIs. We have six simple key performance measures for the whole business. Recovering our profitability has been key to our turnaround, building a platform for long-term growth and creating value for all stakeholders. Group operating profit, before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles. It is the headline measure of the Group's performance. Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was PS2,206m, up 33.5% at constant exchange rates. We have reduced our operating costs, and continued our focus on delivering profitable growth and improving the quality of our sales. Strong cash generation is an important part of our underlying philosophy as we manage our business. Retail operating cash flow is the cash generated from operations of continuing operations, excluding the effects of Tesco Bank's cash flows. It is a measure of the cash generation and working capital efficiency by the Retail business, recognising that Tesco Bank is run and regulated independently from the Retail operations. We generated retail operating cash of PS2,502m, down 9.8 %. This is reported after a c. PS 490 m working capital timing impact year-on-year, including a timing impact of PS 278 m following the failure of a key supplier, Palmer & Harvey, at the end of the last financial year. A further PS 210 m impact relates most significantly to the delay of the implementation of a new general ledger system in the UK & ROI, and additionally the deprioritisation of some ongoing working capital initiatives at a time of political uncertainty.

Our supplier satisfaction measure reflects the percentage of suppliers across the Group who responded positively when asked \"Overall how satisfied are you with your experience of working with Tesco? \", in our Supplier Viewpoint survey. Overall supplier satisfaction was 77.5%, up 2.6pts, the highest ever score recorded for the Group.

Results this year include the consolidation of Booker for 51 weeks since our merger completed on 5 March 2018. Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was up 34.0% to PS2,206m, as we continue to simplify the business and reduce costs, and we achieved a second half operating margin of 3.96% 3.79% excluding Booker. Our statutory profit before tax increased to PS2,153m including PS 53 m of exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles. We delivered a strong performance on net debt excluding Tesco Bank which was PS 2.9 bn, after PS 766 m of Booker cash consideration. We are continuing to focus on customer satisfaction, cash profitability, free cash flow and earnings growth and are using these measures to inform our decisions as we look to create sustainable value for shareholders. Reflecting our continued improved performance and confidence in ongoing cash generation, the Board has proposed the payment of a 4.10 pence per share final dividend following on from the interim dividend of 1.67 pence per share. This takes the total dividend for the year to 5.77 pence per share, up 92.3% year on year.

Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 18 Tesco' contributed to our overall UK market sales and volume outperformance during the fourth quarter. In general merchandise, we continue to focus on sustainable categories that complement the grocery shop. We are driving growth in those categories by differentiating our offer. For example, our Fox & Ivy and Go Cook ranges contributed to like-for-like sales growth of 4.2% in our Home category. Our clothing like-for-like sales grew by 3.0% and in February 2019 we launched selected F&F Womenswear items on Next. We closed Tesco Direct from 9 July, with our like-for-like sales performance removing the impact of this closure. All store formats and channels delivered like-for-like sales growth, with particularly strong performance in our convenience business, including One Stop, where we launched a further 100 Own Brand products, offering excellent quality and value to customers. Our online grocery sales grew by 2.8% year-on-year including our biggest ever sales week at Christmas with nearly 51 million items delivered and 776,000 orders. We have seen a strong response to the launch of Jack's - our new brand and store format - with a net promoter score of 53% and very high levels of customer awareness. Booker's like-for-like sales grew by 11.1% 10.8% excluding tobacco during the year, including a strong performance from symbol group stores. Sales growth in the fourth quarter eased as we started to annualise contract wins secured in the prior year. We are continuing to unlock the benefits of Joining Forces for Booker's customers, with greater choice, lower prices and better quality. In ROI, like-for-like sales grew by 1.3%. In a competitive market, we have continued to make good progress during the year, growing volumes across all food categories. UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was PS1,537m, up 45.1%, with operating margin growth of 62 basis points year-on-year. During the year, our cost savings programme progressed well and we further simplified what we do and how we serve customers in our store operations and in head office. Our strategic ambition to maximise the mix led to our focus on more sustainable general merchandise categories, including closing Tesco Direct in July. The operating loss relating to Tesco Direct was PS 94 m in the 2017 18 financial year. UK & ROI operating profit also includes a benefit of PS52m relating to a change in Clubcard accounting estimates. The change follows a detailed review of our accounting treatment ahead of the implementation of IFRS 15 and results in a more precise match between the redemption value per point and the historic issuance value. Booker contributed PS196m to operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles for the 51 weeks consolidated since completion of our merger on 5 March 2018. We delivered PS79m of the synergies identified in the Booker merger process - ahead of our initial expectation of PS60m in the first year - and are well on track to deliver our target of c. PS200m synergies per annum by the end of the third year. We now anticipate that exceptional integration costs over the three years will total PS 50 m-PS 75 m, lower than the PS 145 m which had been originally planned. Excluding Booker operating profit and synergies, UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was up 19.2%, with margin expansion of 39bps. In Central Europe, overall like-for-like sales declined by 2.3 %. A planned reduction of unprofitable general merchandise sales, including a decision not to participate in Black Friday promotions, impacted like-for-like sales performance by 1.2 % for the full year. In addition, changes to Sunday trading regulations in Poland resulted in 25 fewer trading days in the year which, in addition to a public holiday announced at short notice, impacted like-for-like sales in the region by 1.3 %. Sunday trading regulations effective from January 2019 mean that our stores in Poland are now only able to open on the last Sunday of each month, compared with two Sundays per month previously. In the second half, we saw a strong customer response as we launched our 'Star Lines' initiative across the region, reducing the price of more than 600 key products. VAT, inc. fuel PS6,298m PS6,585m Revenue includes: fuel PS268m PS242m Operating profit before exceptional items PS186m PS119m 56.3% 56.3% Operating profit margin before exceptional items 2.95% 1.81% 113bps 115bps Statutory operating profit PS232m PS212m Central Europe operating profit before exceptional items was PS186m, up 56.3% year-on-year at actual exchange rates. We are improving the quality of our business by focusing on more sustainable product categories and reducing less profitable ranges, such as electricals. In addition, operating costs are being reduced across the region as we simplify the store service model, for example, we reduced the number of price changes by 28% in the year. In Poland, we closed 62 loss-making stores which contributed to Poland making a small profit in the second half. VAT, inc. fuel PS4,873m PS4,947m Revenue includes: fuel - - Operating profit before exceptional items PS286m PS299m 6.7 % 4.3 % Operating profit margin before exceptional items 5.87% 6.04% 17 bps 17 bps Statutory operating profit PS219m PS277m Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 19 Strategic report Financial review continued Overall like-for-like sales performance in Asia was 6.2 % for the year, including the impact of significant changes to our sales mix and promotional strategy, particularly in the first half. Like-for-like sales performance improved to 3.0 % in the fourth quarter. For the year, we saw an impact of 1.2 % from the issuance of government welfare cards in Thailand but this had eased by the end of the fourth quarter. Asia operating profit before exceptional items was PS286m. In the first half, profit was impacted by the combined effect of sales deleverage, price investment and repositioning of promotional investment in Thailand. Performance improved significantly during the second half as we successfully concluded renegotiations with our suppliers and accelerated plans to restructure our store and office operations in Thailand. As a result, we have been able to recover our operating margin more fully and quickly than we had anticipated at the half-year stage. 2018 19 2017 18 Year-on-year change Revenue PS1,097m PS1,047m 4.7% Operating profit before exceptional items PS197m PS169m 16.6% Statutory operating profit PS167m PS145m 15.2% Lending to customers PS12,426m PS11,522m 7.8% Customer deposits PS10,465m PS9,245m 13.2% Net interest margin 3.8% 3.9% 0.1 % Risk asset ratio 18.4% 19.4% 1.0 % Tesco Bank has continued to focus on delivering a positive experience for our banking and insurance customers. We have made significant improvements to the online credit card journey and relaunched a Banking app, making it easier for customers to self-serve. In a difficult and competitive insurance market, investment has been focused on retention of existing customers. Overall, active customer numbers have reduced by 1.0 % year-onyear with growth in banking offset by a reduction in insurance. Operating profit before exceptional items increased by 16.6% year-on-year to PS197m, including strong retail banking performance with both cards and loans continuing to perform well. The insurance contribution has fallen year-on-year, impacted by competitive market conditions, albeit partly offset by a PS13m one-off benefit relating to upfront recognition of insurance renewals following a Contact renewal with our third party insurance provider. Exceptional items of PS 30 m relating to Tesco Bank include a payment of PS 16 m in relation to a settlement agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority FCA following an online fraudulent attack on Tesco Bank in November 2016 and a Payment Protection Insurance PPI charge of PS 16 m recognised in the year. On an underlying basis, the cost-to-income ratio has improved to 56.2% from 60.0%. Lending balances rose 7.8% year-on-year to PS12.4bn, comprising PS3.8bn secured lending up 25% and PS8.7bn unsecured lending up 1.8%. The balance sheet remains strong and well positioned to support future lending growth from both a liquidity and capital perspective with a risk asset ratio of 18.4%. The Group has adopted IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' for the period ending 24 February 2019. IFRS 9 has been applied retrospectively at 25 February 2018 by adjusting the opening balance sheet at that date. For Tesco Bank, the adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in a decrease in opening total assets of PS223m, with a related deferred tax asset of PS57m. The overall impact on opening equity was therefore a reduction of PS166m. Exceptional items in operating profit. Exceptional items are excluded from our headline performance measures by virtue of their size and nature in order to reflect management's view of the underlying performance of the Group. Restructuring and redundancy costs of PS 220 m relate to the simplification of our business and working practices across the Group. These include charges of PS 38 m incurred as a result of the closure of our loss-making online general merchandise business, Tesco Direct. Provision for customer redress of PS 16 m relating to Tesco Bank, reflects additional costs in respect of PPI as a result of higher claim rates than previously estimated. PPI compensation claims must be made before the deadline of 29 August 2019. 2018 19 2017 18 Net restructuring and redundancy costs PS 220 m PS 102 m Provision for customer redress PS 16 m PS 24 m FCA obligations PS37m PS25m Property transactions PS105m PS79m Tesco Bank FCA charge PS 16 m - Booker integration costs PS 15 m - Release of provision relating to HMRC VAT appeal PS176m - Guaranteed minimum pensions GMP equalisation PS 43 m - Net impairment reversal of non-current assets and onerous lease provision PS10m PS53m Sale of Lazada PS7m PS124m Disposal of opticians business - PS38m Total exceptional items in statutory operating profit PS25m PS193m Amortisation of acquired intangible assets PS 78 m - Total exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles in statutory operating profit PS 53 m PS193m There is an exceptional credit of PS37m in relation to the Shareholder Compensation Scheme which comprises a provision release of PS17m as we have now processed all outstanding claims and an insurance recovery of PS20m. Exceptional profits on property transactions of PS105m have arisen from disposals within the UK and Central Europe. We have incurred a charge of PS 16 m relating to a settlement payment agreed with the FCA following an online fraudulent attack on Tesco Bank in November 2016. Booker integration costs of PS 15 m relate to costs incurred in integrating Booker within the Tesco Group, mainly focused on aligning distribution networks and operating platforms. In 2017 18, we recovered PS160m of VAT from HMRC following a favourable court ruling regarding the treatment of VAT on Clubcard rewards. We subsequently recognised a provision of PS176m for VAT and interest as HMRC appealed the court decision. Following HMRC's decision not to appeal a further court judgement in our favour in January this year, this provision has now been released. Following a recent High Court ruling on equalisation of guaranteed minimum pensions GMP, we have recognised a PS 43 m non-cash charge in respect of the Group's defined benefit pension liability. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 20 Net impairment reversal of non-current assets and onerous lease provision totals PS10m. This includes a net reversal of PS69m in property, plant and equipment, a charge of PS 14 m in software and intangible assets and a net charge of PS 44 m in onerous property provisions. Amortisation of acquired intangible assets is excluded from our headline performance measures. Our combination with Booker resulted in the recognition of goodwill of PS3,093m and a PS755m intangible asset, driving amortisation of acquired intangible assets of PS 78 m for the full year. The net effect of exceptional items and acquired intangibles amortisation on operating profit during the year was PS 53 m. This compares to a net PS193m last year, which includes PS124m profit on the sale of Lazada in June 2017. Joint ventures and associates, interest and tax. Our share of post-tax profits from joint ventures and associates before exceptional items was PS24m, an increase of PS30m year-onyear due to a further reduction in losses recognised in Gain Land, our associate in China. An exceptional gain of PS11m was also recognised on our share of profits from a mall disposal in Gain Land. 2018 19 2017 18 Interest payable on medium-term notes, loans and bonds PS 256 m PS 363 m Interest receivable on associated derivatives PS18m PS31m Net interest on medium-term notes, loans and bonds PS 238 m PS 332 m Other interest receivable and similar income PS22m PS44m Other finance charges and interest payable PS 57 m PS 70 m Capitalised interest PS1m PS2m Net finance cost before exceptional charges, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments PS 272 m PS 356 m Fair value remeasurements of financial instruments PS 153 m PS23m Net pension finance costs PS 89 m PS 162 m Exceptional charge - translation of Korea proceeds - PS 38 m Net finance costs PS 514 m PS 533 m Net finance costs before exceptional charges, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments reduced by PS84m year-on-year to PS 272 m. This improvement was mainly driven by a lower level of gross debt. We saw a PS94m reduction in net interest on medium-term notes, loans and bonds from PS 332 m to PS 238 m as a result of debt maturities and bond tenders. We undertook two bond tenders during the year which reduced interest payable by PS34m and we expect an annualised benefit of PS52m. Net finance costs of PS 514 m were PS19m lower year-on-year. Within net finance costs, fair value remeasurements includes PS 121 m relating to the premium paid on the repurchase of long-dated bonds. Net pension finance costs decreased by PS73m year-on-year to PS 89 m, driven by a lower opening pension deficit, partly offset by a higher discount rate. For 2019 20, net pension finance costs are expected to decrease to c. PS 72 m. Last year, an exceptional loss of PS 38 m arose on the translation of the proceeds from the sale of our Homeplus business in Korea. This translation effect did not represent an economic cost to the Group. Tax on Group profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was PS 413 m. The effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles for the year is 24.1%. This tax rate is higher than the UK statutory rate, primarily due to the impact of the 8% supplementary tax surcharge on bank profits and depreciation of assets that do not qualify for tax relief. We expect the impact of these items on the effective tax rate to reduce as our overall level of profitability continues to increase. Therefore, along with the additional impact from the UK corporation tax rate reducing by 2% from April 2020, we expect the effective tax rate to reduce to around 20% in the medium-term. The effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items for the 2019 20 financial year is expected to be around 22%. On a statutory basis, the total tax charge is PS 354 m which includes a PS59m credit relating to exceptional items. Cash tax paid in the year was PS370m up PS194m year-on-year including PS232m of corporate tax paid in the UK up PS157m year-on-year. This increase principally reflects our improved profitability and the benefit last year from utilising remaining UK tax losses. Earnings per share on a continuing operations basis. Our diluted earnings per share before exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments was 15.40p, 29.4% higher year-on-year principally due to our stronger profit performance. Statutory basic earnings per share from continuing operations were 13.65p, 12.3% higher year-on-year. 2018 19 2017 18 Movement Net debt excludes Tesco Bank PS 2,863 m PS 2,625 m PS 238 m Discounted operating lease commitments PS 6,999 m PS 6,931 m PS 68 m Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax PS 2,338 m PS 2,728 m PS390m Total indebtedness PS 12,200 m PS 12,284 m PS84m Overall, total indebtedness has decreased by PS84m year-on-year. Retail net debt increased by PS 0.2 bn to PS 2.9 bn, after the cash outflow of PS 0.8 bn relating to our combination with Booker. Discounted operating lease commitments increased by PS 68 m, including the consolidation of PS 0.4 bn Booker lease commitments. On 13 September 2018, we exercised our option to buy back the 50% equity holding in the Tesco Atrato Limited Partnership held by our property joint venture partner. The acquisition is scheduled to complete in September 2019, and will lead to a reduction in discounted lease commitments of PS400m undiscounted PS790m, and consolidation of the debt held by the joint venture. On an IAS 19 basis, our pension deficit net of deferred tax has reduced from PS2.7bn last year to PS2.3bn at the end of the current year. The movement during the year is primarily attributable to continued deficit contributions in addition to strong asset performance. Our key credit metrics, which are fixed charge cover and total indebtedness EBITDAR, have further improved since the end of the last financial year, from 2.7 to 3.2 times and from 3.3 to 2.8 times, respectively. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 21 Strategic report Summary retail cash flow. Retail operating cash flow of PS2,502m reflects a strong underlying improvement in cash profitability offset by a c. PS 490 m working capital timing impact year-on-year, driven by two factors. First, this year's working capital net outflow of PS 312 m includes payments of PS 139 m which were delayed from the last financial year following the failure of a key supplier Palmer & Harvey. Together with the corresponding benefit in last year's working capital net inflow, this creates a PS 278 m year-on-year timing impact. Second, a further PS 210 m impact within working capital relates to decisions made in the second half of 2018 19. The most significant of these relates to a decision to delay the implementation of a new general ledger system in the UK & ROI by a few months, which resulted in some receipts being postponed into the beginning of the 2019 20 financial year. In addition, we chose to deprioritise some ongoing working capital initiatives in order to safeguard availability and service levels for customers at a time of political uncertainty. 2018 19 2017 18 Operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles PS2,206m PS1,646m Less: Tesco Bank operating profit before exceptional items PS 197 m PS 169 m Retail operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles PS2,009m PS1,477m Add back: Depreciation and amortisation PS1,214m PS1,212m Other reconciling items PS94m PS28m Pension deficit contribution PS 266 m PS 245 m Underlying increase decrease in working capital PS 312 m PS493m Retail cash generated from operations before exceptional items PS2,739m PS2,965m Exceptional cash items: PS 237 m PS 192 m Relating to prior years: - Shareholder Compensation Scheme Payments and SFO Fine PS 43 m PS 149 m - Utilisation of onerous lease provisions PS 81 m PS 92 m - Restructuring payments PS 60 m PS 53 m Relating to current year: - Restructuring payments PS 68 m PS 67 m Other PS15m PS169m Retail operating cash flow PS2,502m PS2,773m Cash capex PS 1,126 m PS 1,190 m Net interest PS 283 m PS 297 m Tax PS 302 m PS 131 m Property proceeds PS285m PS253m Property purchases - store buybacks PS 136 m PS 393 m Market purchases of shares net of proceeds PS 146 m PS11m Acquisitions & disposals and dividends received PS 635 m PS362m Add back: Booker acquisition costs included in Acquisition & disposals above a PS747m - Retail free cash flow b PS906m PS1,388m a The cost of major acquisitions and disposals are removed from the Group's definition of free cash flow. b Retail free cash flow includes PS146m market purchases of shares net of proceeds in relation to share schemes. Last year's retail free cash flow has been restated by PS11m to reflect this. Financial review continued In addition to the working capital timing impacts, the lower level of retail free cash flow year-on-year principally reflects two factors. First, a higher tax charge as our profitability continues to improve and second, a net cash outflow of PS 146 m relating to the market purchase of shares. The market purchase follows our commitment to offset any dilution from the issuance of new shares to satisfy the requirements of share schemes. We expect to utilise a similar amount of cash in future years in line with this commitment, with the exact amount dependent on performance. Other items include an exceptional cash outflow of PS 43 m relating to final payments under the Shareholder Compensation Scheme which have now been processed. Exceptional cash items also include the utilisation of PS 81 m of our exceptional onerous lease provision in the year, of which PS 23 m related to one-off costs to surrender leases and PS 58 m related to ongoing lease agreements. We reduced cash capital expenditure by 5.3% year-on-year to PS 1.1 bn reflecting our disciplined approach to capital investment. In net cash interest, the benefit of lower interest paid was partially offset by the timing of PS55m of interest payable on our largest sterling-denominated bond. The timing of our year-end date has meant that last year's annual coupon payment on this bond was made in this financial year. Retail cash tax paid in the year was PS 302 m, higher than last year reflecting our improved profitability and the benefit last year from utilising remaining UK tax losses. We generated PS285m of proceeds from property sales including PS129m relating to Kennington and a number of small disposals in the UK, PS92m relating to three retail sites in Central Europe and PS58m relating to two Booker properties. We completed the buyback of Stroud superstore in the first half and Cirencester Extra and Shepton Mallet superstore in the second half. 2018 19 2017 18 UK & ROI PS709m PS676m Central Europe PS130m PS133m Asia PS235m PS239m Tesco Bank PS31m PS50m Group PS1,105m PS1,098m Capital expenditure shown in the table above reflects expenditure on ongoing business activities across the Group. Our capital expenditure for the year was PS1.1bn, a similar level to last year and lower than we originally anticipated for this year as we continue to exercise discipline in our investment decisions. In the UK & ROI, spend was focused on maintaining and refreshing our stores, alongside convenience store openings in the UK. Capital spend in Central Europe and Asia has remained at a broadly similar level as last year. The focus of spend in Central Europe was on repurposing our existing store estate and in Asia, spend primarily related to our new store opening programme in Thailand. Going forward, we expect our annual capital expenditure to remain within a range of PS1.1bn to PS1.4bn. Statutory capital expenditure of PS1.2bn includes PS136m relating to the three UK property buybacks. We reduced the total amount of retailing selling space across the Group by just under 1.7 million square feet in the year. Across Central Europe and Asia, our repurposing programme has Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 22 contributed a net reduction of 1.0 million square feet. In Central Europe, we have repurposed 669,000 square feet across 14 stores, partnering with H&M, Reserved, Decathlon and Rossman. In Asia, we have repurposed 26 stores, mainly in Thailand where we have partnered with Mr. DIY home improvement and additional leisure partners including cinemas and play centres. In the UK & ROI, we opened 24 new stores in the period, including 13 in our convenience formats in the UK and eight Jack's stores. We closed a further 20 stores in the UK, including two Booker stores. Our net reduction of 66 stores in Central Europe during the year was driven primarily by the closure of 62 stores in Poland. In Asia, we opened 72 stores including 70 in Thailand, principally in our convenience format. We closed a further 56 stores in Thailand as we optimise our convenience store network. The estimated market value of our fully owned property has increased by PS0.6bn to PS21.3bn, with PS0.2bn of this increase resulting from our merger with Booker. The market value of PS21.3bn represents a surplus of PS2.7bn over the net book value NBV. Our Group freehold property ownership percentage, by value, has remained stable at 58% year-on-year. In addition to an increase in market value of existing properties, we regained ownership of three stores in the UK. This was offset by the impact of consolidating Booker's 183 leasehold properties. The repurchase of the three UK stores will result in an annualised rental saving of PS7m. We continue to seek opportunities to further reduce our exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift rent inflation where the economics are attractive. Reflecting the continued improvement in the business and our confidence in ongoing cash generation, we propose to pay a final dividend of 4.10 pence per ordinary share. This takes the total dividend for the year to 5.77 pence per ordinary share, up 92.3% year-on-year, following the payment of an interim dividend of 1.67 pence per ordinary share in November 2018. We would then expect to maintain this level going forward, expressed as an earnings pay-out ratio of around 50%, with an anticipated split of broadly one-third to two-thirds between interim and final dividends in any given year. The proposed final dividend was approved by the Board of Directors on 9 April 2019 and is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 13 June 2019. The final dividend will be paid on 21 June 2019 to shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on 17 May 2019 the Record Date. Shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividend in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan DRIP. The last date for receipt of DRIP elections and revocations will be 31 May 2019. We are confident that we will meet the remaining goals in our turnaround plan in 2019 20 and deliver a level of profitability pre-IFRS 16 and excluding Booker within the 3.5%-4.0% margin range. Whilst the market remains uncertain, our performance to date is strong, leaving us well positioned to invest in our competitiveness as we continue to celebrate 100 years of great value for customers. We remain comfortable with consensus profit expectations for 2019 20. Tesco is introducing IFRS 16, the new financial reporting standard on accounting for leases, for its 2019 20 financial year. IFRS 16 has no economic impact on the Group. It has no effect on how the business is run, nor on cash flows for the Group. It does however have a significant impact on the way the assets, liabilities and the income statement for the Group are presented, as well as the classification of cash flows relating to lease contracts. The Group will adopt the standard fully retrospectively. Detail on the impact of IFRS 16 on our 2018 19 financial statements can be found in Note 36. The introduction of IFRS 16 has no bearing on the plans or financial ambitions Tesco has shared with the market. As a result of the progress we are making strengthening the balance sheet and delivering free cash flow, we now expect to reach a dividend cover level of around two times earnings in the 2019 20 financial year. We will maintain our focus on balance sheet strength, targeting a leverage range of 3 times to 2.5 times total indebtedness to EBITDAR on a post-IFRS 16 basis.

For the past 100 years we have been a business with a strong community spirit and a desire to do the right thing. We believe we can make a positive contribution to our colleagues, customers and communities through small actions that can add up to make a big difference. One of our values, 'Every little help makes a big difference', inspired our Little Helps Plan, which we launched two years ago. It aims to pull together all of our efforts and refocus our activities on the social and environmental challenges that matter most to our customers, colleagues, suppliers and stakeholders. Every week we serve nearly 80 million customers across eight countries and they tell us they want us to provide affordable, healthy, sustainable products. They also want us to look after our colleagues and the communities where we operate. We have listened to their views, and identified three pillars where we could make the biggest difference: our people, our products and our places. Underpinning these pillars are areas where we are committed to doing the right thing. These include important issues such as health and safety, cyber security and anti-bribery. We call these our foundations, as they are the bedrock of a responsible business and are fundamental to the way we operate. For more information on how we identified the pillars, visit: www. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 24 Embedding the Little Helps Plan. The Little Helps Plan is integral to our business strategy, helping us to serve our customers a little better every day and contributing directly to our strategic drivers. By addressing the key issues that we know matter to our customers, colleagues, suppliers and stakeholders, we are able to bring to life the meaning behind our value 'Every little help makes a big difference' and build a differentiated brand. Our ambitious targets are helping to stimulate innovation within the business - for example driving us to expand our range of innovative plant-based products or encouraging us to trial cutting edge technologies to help our customers recycle more. The Plan is also delivering real reductions in operating costs, such as through our work to reduce our carbon footprint. Our investment in energy efficiency between 2015 16 and 2017 18 has delivered PS37m in savings to date. To further embed the Little Helps Plan into our business and to measure our progress, we have introduced KPIs for each action set out in the Plan. We monitor these regularly to help guide our work. We first published progress against these in November 2018 and a further update can be found in our full Little Helps Plan report. This year we have realigned when we report progress against the Little Helps Plan - reporting at the same time as the Annual Report. Going forward we will continue to publish annual updates alongside the Annual Report. We have a robust governance framework in place to support us in delivering the Little Helps Plan and integrating it into our business strategy. This establishes clear responsibility and accountability for our performance, and ensures effective decision-making. Implementation begins in the UK. We then share learnings with our international markets to enable them to develop country-specific plans. Each pillar of the Plan is owned by a director within the relevant business function. These owners, in each country or region, are responsible for the day-to-day delivery of the Plan as well as tracking progress against the relevant KPIs. Each country or region has developed a three-year roadmap which is reviewed annually, with key priorities and deliverables set out for the year ahead. Our Corporate Responsibility Committee CRC is responsible for ensuring the Board devotes sufficient attention to corporate responsibility in its widest sense. The Committee has been on a number of visits in 2018 19 to see how our policies and programmes are working on the ground. For more information on the Committee and its activities, see page 55.

We cannot achieve our ambitions alone. Our relationships with our suppliers and expert partners are fundamental to the success of both our business and our implementation of the Little Helps Plan. For example, our Sustainable Farming Groups are essential in helping to secure the future of farming and building long-term relationships with our farmers. This year, we have established a four-year strategic partnership with WWF to help us tackle some of the environmental challenges we cannot address alone. Our overall goal is to halve the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket. We also continue to work with Cancer Research UK, Diabetes UK and the British Heart Foundation to promote healthier living to customers and colleagues. In line with UN Global Compact guidance, we have identified which of the UN Sustainable Development Goals SDGs are particularly relevant to us. com sdgs for more information on how our strategy supports the SDGs.

Our people make our business and we ensure Tesco is a place where everyone can get on, whatever their ambitions. To help our colleagues develop the skills they need to succeed, we offered 1,265 new UK apprenticeships last year, in areas such as Large Goods Vehicle LGV driving and food technology. Digital skills are increasingly important across our business, so we are working with the Makers Academy to offer colleagues opportunities to retrain as software development engineers. We are also training over 50 digital champions in our UK distribution centres to coach colleagues on practical digital skills and aim to start rolling this programme out to stores by the end of the year. 17,156 line managers have already attended our new manager training programme which covers how to support their colleagues in getting on. We are committed to helping the next generation. Last year, over 2,300 young people started their career or gained work experience with us through one of our early careers programmes. In the UK our Movement to Work programme has provided training and work placements for 629 unemployed young people and, through our partnership with the Prince's Trust and IGD, we have already helped over 6,500 school children develop employment skills. Our Business Service Centre in Bengaluru, India, has helped to open a new Career Development Centre for young people, offering nine vocational courses on areas such as digital literacy.

We have launched more ways to get active, free health checks, mental health support and a new financial wellbeing programme. Earlier this year we conducted the UK's largest ever workplace health survey, with our charity partners Cancer Research UK, Diabetes UK and the British Heart Foundation. 8,000 colleagues responded to the survey and it helped us identify new ways to support colleagues to live healthier lives, such as introducing a discounted gym pass. We want everyone to feel welcome and 84% of colleagues globally tell us there is an inclusive culture at Tesco. Our five established UK colleague networks play a big part in helping colleagues find support and mentoring. Our ambition for 2019 20 is to support our other markets to roll out networks relevant for their colleagues. We are members of the 30% Club and 31% of our Board is female. In the UK, we introduced a targeted career development community, which supported 80 talented female colleagues to drive their own career, build their network and grow as authentic leaders. We are committed to offering a fair and competitive total reward package and, in the last two years, have increased hourly rates for UK store colleagues by 10.5%. See page 65 for our gender pay analysis. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 26 Products. We believe that healthy, sustainable products should be affordable for everyone, regardless of their budget. This ambition guides our actions on health, sourcing, packaging and food waste. A healthier place to work and shop. Seven out of ten families say supermarkets should do more to help people make healthier choices, such as by making healthier alternatives more affordable and enjoyable. By gradually adjusting our products over a number of years, taking out a little fat, sugar and salt, or adding more vegetables or fibre, our customers can still buy their favourite foods every week while being a little healthier. In the UK over a third of our frozen and chilled ready meals now contain at least 1 of your 5 a day. In Thailand we are the first retailer to bring all our Own Brand soft drinks below 6g of sugar per 100ml and we have removed trans fats from all Tesco bakery items. To encourage customers to discover and try healthier alternatives that contain less fat, sugar or salt than standard products, we have now run three 'helpful little swaps' events in the UK. During our September 2018 health event, a basket of 'helpful little swaps' cost 12% less than a standard basket. Sales of these comparable products increased by 17% year on year. This was our first event fronted by Jamie Oliver since he joined Tesco as a health ambassador. To help colleagues and customers cook from scratch, he also created a series of healthier recipes and tips. As well as being delicious, we made sure they were affordable by reducing the costs of the main ingredients to encourage people to try them. Food production has a significant impact on our planet's natural resources. It also affects millions of livelihoods around the world. We want customers to feel reassured that our products have been sourced with respect for the environment and the people involved. We work in partnership with thousands of suppliers and producers to make sure that, as well as great quality, we offer the same ethical and environmental standards, across all our product ranges, at affordable prices. We have joined forces with WWF to make it easier for customers to buy affordable, healthy, sustainable food. Together, we will focus on helping customers eat more sustainably, restoring nature in food production and leading the food industry in eliminating food and packaging waste. One of the environments where we can make the biggest difference is forests. Global demand for food is putting significant pressure on these vital ecosystems. We have committed to achieving zero-net deforestation in our sourcing of agricultural raw materials by 2020. For Tesco, the most important of these materials is soy: a key ingredient in animal feed. We have taken a lead in the food industry in developing and implementing a soy sourcing programme that will ensure in the future 100% of the soy our suppliers use comes from zero-net deforestation sources. This follows our work on palm oil where all of the palm oil in our UK Own Brand products is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. We are also working towards all paper wood used in our UK Own Brand products being certified by the Forest Stewardship Council or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, or coming from a recycled source. In December 2018, we revised our human rights strategy to allow us to focus on the four issues that most affect the people in our supply chain. Work has already begun in each of these areas: Forced labour: Over 200 UK colleagues have received training to help them tackle modern day slavery risks in supply chains and our own operations. Gender equality: We have signed up to the UN's Women's Empowerment Principles and our partnership with the Ethical Tea Partnership and UNICEF in Assam has helped equip 35,000 adolescent girls with the knowledge and life skills to reduce their vulnerability to abuse and exploitation. Sustainable livelihoods: 5 pence from every pack of Tesco Extra Strong tea sold is donated to run community projects in two tea estates in Malawi. The first beneficiaries will be 10 Village Savings and Loan Associations which help increase incomes through simple savings and loan facilities. Worker representation: We are members of the 'ACT' agreement between global brands, retailers and trade unions to achieve living wages for garment workers through collective bargaining at industry level. 27 Strategic report Little Helps Plan continued Creating a closed loop for packaging. To make efficient use of valuable resources, and minimise environmental impact, we are committed to ensuring we never use more packaging than is needed, and what we do use is from sustainable sources and can go on to be reused or recycled. Our ambition is to create a closed loop for packaging across our UK operations, meaning no packaging will go to waste. To achieve this, government, industry and consumers all need to play a role and the UK recycling infrastructure has to be reformed. For our part, we have set three strategic priorities: simplifying materials and design to be fully recyclable, increasing recovery and recycling, and changing customer behaviour. Alongside our aim to halve packaging weight by 2025, we have committed to end the use of the hardest to recycle materials from our Own Brand packaging by the end of 2019. Thanks to the support of our suppliers, we are now over 60% towards meeting our commitment. In the past year we have donated surplus food equivalent to 62.7 million meals, across the UK, Ireland, Central Europe and Asia to local charities and community groups. All Tesco stores in the UK, Ireland and Malaysia offer surplus food as well as 747 stores in Central Europe and 40 stores in Thailand. We have also introduced 'colleague shops' in all our UK stores to help tackle food waste. Here we offer surplus food, not taken by local charities, to colleagues free of charge. Any remaining suitable bakery and produce is sent to animal feed. These combined initiatives have resulted in a 51% reduction in food safe for human consumption going to waste in the UK compared with last year. We have a shared responsibility to tackle food waste from farm to fork. The solution lies in working in partnership with our suppliers and helping customers reduce food waste in their homes. One example of this is that we have removed 'best before' dates from over 180 fruit and vegetable lines to help prevent perfectly edible items being thrown away too early. We are extending our approach and learnings to other markets. In Central Europe we have developed a tailored list of hard to recycle materials, taking into consideration local recycling infrastructure, and are working with suppliers there to eliminate these. In Thailand we have switched to recyclable thermoform plastic for our fresh meat and fruit-to-go products, reducing plastic waste by 12%. We are trialling a reverse vending scheme for plastic bottles in the UK and in Thailand, testing different rewards - such as vouchers and charity donations - to encourage people to get involved. We also have collection points in our large UK stores where customers can recycle plastic bags and polyethylene films that are not always accepted through kerbside collections, and are trialling a collection scheme in 10 stores for all bags, pouches, films and crisp packets to test a new recycling method. Every year, a third of the world's food goes to waste. As a food retailer, we have a responsibility to take action, which is why we have committed to helping halve food waste, from farm to fork, by 2030. This is in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goal target 12.3. Our Group Chief Executive, Dave Lewis, chairs a coalition of leaders from government, business, international organisations, research institutions, and civil society, called Champions 12.3, whose purpose is to encourage countries and food businesses globally to set targets, measure and publish their data, and act on the insights to tackle food waste. We were the first UK retailer to publish our food waste data and update it every year. This was followed by our businesses in Ireland and Central Europe, and now Booker. 27 of our largest Own Brand suppliers have published data on food waste in their own operations and 10 of our largest branded suppliers have committed to do the same, as well as take concrete steps to reduce food waste in the supply chain and in the homes of our customers. Our target is that no food that is safe for human consumption is wasted in our UK business. Over the last two years, as a result of our efforts, and in partnership with charities, we have reached 81% a of this target. Food that is damaged, or fresh food that cannot be frozen, is excluded from the scope of our target as we are unable to donate it to charities. 2,914 tonnes Hardest to recycle materials removed from our Own Brand packaging UK Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 28 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 29 Strategic report KPMG LLP was engaged to provide independent limited assurance over the selected food waste data highlighted in this report with a using the assurance standard ISAE 3000.

Method statements for each business are available at www. Little Helps Plan continued Places. Every week we serve nearly 80 million customers, in over 6,000 communities around the world. We are proud of the contribution we make through the jobs we provide, the businesses we work with and the local causes we support. In 2018 we published an independent report - Value in Your Town - to learn more about the socio-economic contribution we make to our communities in the UK and understand how we could better support them. In 2016 17 alone, we contributed an estimated PS37.3bn gross value added to the UK economy. We support causes and help address issues that colleagues and customers care about locally, such as food poverty. Wherever we operate, we work closely with food banks and local charities to help feed people in need in local communities. To increase the impact of our food redistribution scheme in the UK, we have launched the Tesco Community Cookery School programme to help community groups make the most of the surplus food that they receive from Tesco. Over 1,000 cooks will be given training and nutritious recipes, specially designed by Jamie Oliver and Tesco's food experts. We hope to expand the scheme to a train-the-trainer model, benefiting a further 5,000 community cooks. Another way we support communities is through our community grant programmes in the UK, Ireland and Central Europe. In the UK our Bags of Help scheme redistributes money raised from the sale of carrier bags to fund thousands of projects in local communities. To date PS70m has been invested in local communities, supporting over 23,000 projects chosen by customers - from improved outdoor spaces to training coaches or volunteers. Similarly, our Community Fund initiative in Ireland has donated EU3.7m to support over 13,000 selected local projects. For example, the Ballincollig Gymnastics Club in Cork has been able to buy a new fully sprung floor for the gym thanks to a donation from Tesco. Since the You Choose, We Help programme began in Central Europe, over 3,000 community groups have benefited. To offer further help to our causes in Central Europe, we trialled a volunteering scheme with colleagues at 40 stores. The programme is now being rolled out across the region with colleagues being encouraged to volunteer, during work hours, at the local organisations supported through You Choose, We Help. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 30 Foundations. Our Foundations are the things we take care of behind the scenes, on an ongoing basis, to make sure we remain a responsible, ethical business. They help us manage important evolving risks facing our business, from product safety to data security to health and safety. For information on how we are managing cyber security, product safety, and health and safety risks, see page 32. Business ethics. Our Code of Business Conduct sets down our minimum expectations for all colleagues, wherever they work and whatever their role. This includes important legal obligations and the policies that guide our conduct. It also lets colleagues know about Protector Line, a completely independent support service where they can raise concerns anonymously and confidentially. In October 2018, we updated our Code of Business Conduct to reflect changes to the law, our business and wider society that have taken place since the Code was written in 2015. We also set out clearer expectations about the conduct expected from all colleagues and from managers and senior leaders. Everyone in the business must comply with the Code and colleagues in office roles, along with store and distribution managers, are required to make an annual declaration of compliance. In 2019, more than 26,000 colleagues did so. We have a longstanding commitment to tackling climate change. We were the first FTSE 100 company to set ambitious sciencebased targets to become a zero-carbon business by 2050, in line with the 1.5-degree trajectory of the Paris Climate Agreement. We have also committed to source 100% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. In 2018 19 58% of our electricity, across the Group, was sourced this way. Our carbon footprint is calculated according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and our net carbon footprint in 2018 19 was 3.3 million tonnes of CO 2 e. For our own operations' absolute carbon emissions, we achieved a 9% reduction compared to last year and 31% compared to 2015 16. We are also supporting the move to a low-carbon economy. In November 2018 we announced the development of the largest UK retail electric vehicle charging network. In conjunction with Volkswagen, we will roll out over 2,400 EV charging bays across 600 Tesco stores within the next three years. As supporters of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures TCFD we are working to consider the impacts that climate change may have on our business. For more information, see page 177.

Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 31 Strategic report Principal risks and uncertainties A robust review. We have an established risk management process to identify, assess and monitor the principal risks that we face as a business. We have performed a robust review of the risks that we believe could seriously affect the Group's performance, future prospects, reputation or its ability to deliver against its priorities. This review included an assessment of risks we believe would threaten the Group's business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. We have reviewed our principal risks in line with our strategic drivers. The risks to the business, at a high level, remain unchanged from the previous year. We have reframed our customer risk definition to better reflect current circumstances, set out on page 33. The two shorter-term risks relating to Brexit as well as Booker synergy realisation and integration remain relevant. The risks associated with Brexit are increasing due to the possibility of a 'no deal' scenario and the potential for an abrupt departure from the EU. The Booker integration and synergy realisation risk is decreasing as good progress was made on the expected synergies. The risk management process relies on our assessment of the risk likelihood and impact and on the development and monitoring of appropriate internal controls. Our process for identifying and managing risk is set out in more detail on page 59. We maintain risk registers that discuss the principal risks faced by the Group and this is an important component of our governance framework and how we manage our business. As part of our risk management process, risks are reviewed as a top down and bottom up activity at the Group and the business unit level. The content of the risk registers are considered and discussed through regular meetings with senior management and reviewed by the Executive Committee. Each principal risk is discussed at least annually by the Board to provide oversight and ensure that they remain relevant. The table opposite sets out our principal risks, their link to our strategic drivers, their movement during the year, and a summary, of key controls and mitigating factors. The Board considers these to be the most significant Group risks that may impact the achievement of our six strategic drivers as set out on pages 14 and 15. They do not comprise all of the risks associated with the business and are not set out in priority order. Additional risks not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse effect on the business. The Board considers these to be the most significant risks faced by the Group that may impact the achievement of our six strategic drivers.

Uncertainties including Brexit and macro economic conditions squeeze our customers' budgets and force them to reappraise the concepts of value and loyalty in a way in which we are unable to respond. Ongoing fragmentation of our customer engagement channels exposes us to a risk of diluting customer experience and ability to differentiate our brand. We now have a more consistent approach to building impactful customer propositions, offering high-quality and competitive value while improving the customer experience. Propositions are now developed across channels and geographies to ensure consistency in the engagement with customers. Group-wide customer insight management is undertaken to understand and leverage customer behaviour, expectations and experience across the different parts of the business. We monitor the effectiveness of our processes by regularly tracking our business and competitors against measures that customers tell us are important to their shopping experience. We have well-established product development and quality management processes, which keep the needs of our customers central to our decision-making. Failure to achieve our transformation objectives due to poor prioritisation, ineffective change management and a failure to understand and deliver the technology required, resulting in an inability to progress sufficiently quickly to maintain or increase operating margin and generate sufficient cash to meet business objectives. Achieving our transformation goals continues to demand effort and investment, especially with regard to technology changes. We have multiple transformation programmes underway to simplify our business with clear market strategies and business plans in place which evolve as priorities or situations change. We have appropriate executive-level oversight for all the transformation activities to ensure programmes are adequately resourced and milestones achieved. Failure of our business performance to deliver cash as expected: access to funding markets or facilities being restricted: failures in operational liquidity and currency risk management: Tesco Bank cash call: or adverse changes to the pension deficit funding requirement: create calls on cash higher than anticipated, leading to impacts on financial performance, cash liquidity or the ability to continue to fund operations. We have a disciplined and policy-based approach to treasury management. We have reduced our debt levels and have improving debt metrics. We maintain an infrastructure of systems, policies and reports to ensure discipline and oversight on liquidity matters, including specific treasury and debt-related issues. Our treasury policies are communicated across the Group and are regularly reviewed by the Board, Executive Committee and management. The Group's funding strategy is approved annually by the Board and includes maintaining appropriate levels of working capital, undrawn committed facilities and access to the capital markets. The Audit Committee reviews and annually approves the viability and going concern statements and reports into the Board. There is a long-term funding framework in place for the pension deficit and there is ongoing communication and engagement with the Pension Trustees. Liquidity levels and sources of cash are regularly reviewed and the Group maintains access to committed credit facilities and debt capital markets. While recognising that Tesco Bank is financially separate from Tesco PLC, there is ongoing monitoring of the activities of Tesco Bank that could give rise to risks to Tesco PLC. Failure to deliver an effective, coherent and consistent strategy to respond to our competitors and changes in market conditions in the operating environment, resulting in a loss of market share and failure to improve profitability. We continue to face the ongoing challenge of a changing competitive landscape and price pressure across most of our markets. Our Board develops and regularly challenges the strategic direction of our business to enhance our ability to remain competitive on price, range and service. This activity includes development of our online channels and multiple formats to allow us to compete in different markets. Our Executive Committee and operational management regularly review markets, trading opportunities, competitor strategy and activity. We engage in market scanning and competitor analysis to refine our customer proposition. Indicates that the principal risk has been included as part of the longer term viability scenarios as detailed on page 37. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 33 Strategic report Principal risk Risk movement Key controls and mitigating factors Brand, reputation and trust. Failure to create brand reappraisal opportunities to improve quality, value and service perceptions thus failing to rebuild trust in our brand. We are leveraging the Tesco Centenary to celebrate 100 years of great value and reaffirm our position as the customer champion. We continue to implement a number of initiatives and activities, thereby helping reappraise the brand, increase trust and reputation, while improving our quality and value perception. Maintaining a differentiated brand is one of our strategic priorities. Our Group processes, policies and our Code of Business Conduct sets out how we can make the right decisions for our customers, colleagues, suppliers, communities and investors. We continue to develop communication and engagement programmes to listen to our customers and stakeholders and reflect their needs in our plans. This includes the Supplier Viewpoint and the integration of local community and local marketing programmes. We continue to maximise the value and impact of our brand with the advice of specialist external agencies and in-house marketing expertise. Our Corporate Responsibility Committee is in place to oversee all corporate responsibility activities and initiatives, ensuring alignment with customer priorities and our brand. Failure of our IT infrastructure or key IT systems result in loss of information, inability to operate effectively, financial or regulatory penalties, and negatively impacts our reputation. Further, failure to build resilience at the time of investing in and implementing new technology may result in potential loss of operating capability. Our dependency on technology continues to grow. Ongoing improvements and investment in disaster recovery and business continuity measures help to limit exposure to external threats. A multi-year programme is underway to enhance our technology infrastructure and resilience capabilities. This involves significant investment in our hosting strategy, partnering with cloud providers and re-engineering some of our legacy retail systems, while building redundancy for key business systems. Our technology security programme continues to build security capabilities to strengthen our infrastructure and Information Technology General Controls. Data security and data privacy. Failure to comply with legal or regulatory requirements relating to data security or data privacy in the course of our business activities, results in reputational damage, fines or other adverse consequences. This includes criminal penalties and consequential litigation which result in an adverse impact on our financial performance or unfavourable effects on our ability to do business. As a retail organisation we hold a large amount of customer and colleague personal data, and the threat landscape has been ever growing. The introduction of GDPR in May 2018 has meant an increase in individuals' awareness levels, as well as an increase in the financial penalties which can be levied by the data protection authorities. We put our customers and colleagues at the heart of all decisions we make in relation to the processing of personal data. Our multi-year technology security programme has been driving the enhancement of our security capabilities to improve data security. We have an established team to detect, report and respond to security incidents in a timely fashion. We have a third-party supplier assurance programme focusing on data security and privacy risks. We have made significant investment across the Group to ensure we comply with the requirements of GDPR in Europe, and any other relevant legislation globally. Our privacy compliance programme, which includes assessment and monitoring of risk, continues to drive compliance throughout our global business. There is regular reporting on progress of the security and privacy programmes to governance and oversight committees. Failure to comply with legal and other requirements as the regulatory environment becomes more restrictive, due to changes in the global political landscape, results in fines, criminal penalties for Tesco or colleagues, consequential litigation and an adverse impact on our reputation, financial results, and or our ability to do business. We continue to monitor and improve our controls to ensure we comply with legal and regulatory requirements across the Group. Long-term changes in the global political environment mean that in some markets there is a push towards greater regulation of foreign investors and a favouring of local companies. Wherever we operate, we aim to ensure that the impact of political and regulatory changes is incorporated in our strategic planning and policies. We manage regulatory risks through the use of our risk management framework and we have implemented compliance programmes and committees to manage our most important risks e. g. anti-bribery and competition law. Our compliance programmes ensure that sustainable controls are implemented to mitigate the risk and we conduct assurance activities for each risk area. Our Code of Business Conduct is supported by new starter and annual compliance training and other tools such as our whistleblowing hotline. The engagement of leadership and senior management is critical in the successful management of this risk area and leaders provide clear tone from the top for colleagues. Principal risks and uncertainties continued Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 34 Principal risk Risk movement Key controls and mitigating factors Health and safety. Failure to meet safety standards in relation to our workplace, resulting in death or injury to our customers, colleagues or third parties. We continue to focus our efforts on controls which ensure colleague and customer safety. We have a business-wide, risk-based safety framework which defines how we implement and report on safety controls to ensure that colleagues, contractors and customers have a safe place to work and shop. Each business is required to maintain a Safety Improvement Plan to document and track enhancements. Overall governance is provided by the Group Risk and Compliance Committee, with each business unit operating their own Health and Safety Committee. Our annual colleague survey results, alongside other inputs such as safety audits, informs the delivery of safety initiatives and targeted communications. Failure to attract and retain the required capability and continue to evolve our culture could impact delivery of our purpose and strategic drivers. Market competitiveness continues to affect our ability to attract and retain key specialist talent. There is continued impact arising from fast-changing and complex legislation. Talent planning and people development processes are well established across the Group. Talent and succession planning is discussed annually by the Board and three times a year at the Executive Committee and Nominations and Governance Committee. A Group Inclusion strategy is in place. An independent assessment of all promotions and external hires is conducted at leadership level to ensure capability, potential, leadership and values. The Remuneration Committee agrees objectives and remuneration arrangements for senior management. People risk mitigation plans are in place throughout the Group, supported by the Executive Committee. Responsible sourcing and supply chain. Failure to meet product safety standards resulting in death, injury or illness to customers. Failure to ensure that products are sourced responsibly and sustainably across supply chains including fair pay for workers, adhering to human rights, clean and safe working environments, and that all social and environmental standards are met, leading to breaches of regulations, illness, injury or death to workers and communities, and affecting our reputation. We continue to monitor and improve our controls to further reduce this risk. We have product standards, policies and guidance covering both food and non-food, as well as goods and services not for resale, ensuring that products are safe, legal and of the required quality. Measures include policies and guidance to help to ensure that the human rights of workers are respected and environmental impacts are managed responsibly. Refer to pages 24 to 31 for specific actions highlighted under our Little Helps Plan. Supplier audit programmes are in place to monitor product safety, traceability and integrity, human rights and environmental standards, including unannounced specification inspections of suppliers and facilities. We run colleague training programmes on food and product safety, responsible sourcing, hygiene controls, and also provide support for stores. We also provide targeted training for colleagues and suppliers dealing with specific challenges such as modern slavery. Booker synergy realisation and integration. Failure to successfully integrate Booker is dependent on a number of factors, leading to a risk to our planned synergy commitments and value creation. There has been good progress on the expected synergies. A detailed synergy realisation and integration plan was successfully executed during the financial year. Period-end reporting and tracking of targeted benefits and key performance indicators is embedded. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 35 Strategic report Principal risk Risk movement Key controls and mitigating factors Brexit. Failure to prepare for the UK's departure from the EU will cause disruption to and create uncertainty around our business, not least our ability to recruit and supply to our customers. Any disruption or uncertainty could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. Uncertainty around our departure from the EU has continued to grow as a result of the political deadlock. With the UK's future trading relationship with the EU still to be determined, we continue to contribute to important public policy discussion and engage with government, regulatory bodies and industry. During this process, we will continue to assess and monitor the potential risks and impacts on Tesco customers, colleagues and shareholders, while taking appropriate mitigation measures to address challenges including logistics, staff and supply. This year we put in place a detailed Brexit contingency plan against political and macro-economic changes that could have a material impact on our market and customer proposition. Tesco Bank is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are operational risk, regulatory risk, credit risk, funding and liquidity risk, market risk and business risk. The Bank continues to actively manage the risks to which it is exposed. The Bank has a defined risk appetite, which is approved and reviewed regularly by both the Bank's Board and the Tesco PLC Board. The risk appetite defines the type and amount of risk that the Group is prepared to accept to achieve its objectives, and forms a key link between the day-to-day risk management of the business and its strategic priorities, long-term plan, capital planning and liquidity management. Adherence to risk appetite is monitored through a series of ratios and limits. The Bank operates a risk management framework that is underpinned by governance, policies, processes and controls, reporting, assurance and stress testing. There is Bank Board risk reporting throughout the year, with updates to the Tesco PLC Audit Committee by the Bank's Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer and Audit Committee Chairman. A member of the Tesco PLC Board is also a member of the Bank's Board. Principal risks and uncertainties continued Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. The complex global challenges and uncertainties related to climate change and resource scarcity affect our business and our ambition of providing affordable, healthy and sustainable food. Our approach to these uncertainties is to work collaboratively to tackle both the risks and opportunities. Our Little Helps Plan integrates a number of initiatives across our business to manage some of these risks. Further details are included in the Little Helps Plan section on pages 24 to 31. Tesco has publicly committed to implementing the recommendations June 2017 of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD. As part of our ongoing TCFD assessment, we are using scenario analysis and looking at both short-term and long-term climate risks and opportunities for our UK business. Refer to page 177 for more detailed disclosures on TCFD. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 36 Longer term viability statement. Assessing the Group's longer term prospects and viability. The Directors have based their assessment of viability on the Group's current strategic plan, which is updated and approved annually by the Board and delivers the Group's purpose of 'serving shoppers a little better every day' underpinned by the six strategic drivers detailed on pages 14 and 15. The Group conducts an annual strategic planning process, comprising a comprehensive reassessment of progress against the Group's strategic objectives alongside a careful evaluation of the longer term opportunities and risks in each market in which the Group operates. The process for assessing the principal and emerging risks in each market is an important input to this process. The Group's Strategic Planning and Viability Statement are both considered over a three-year period, as this horizon most appropriately reflects the dynamic and changing retail environment in which the Group operates. The strategic planning process builds from the Group's current position and considers the evolution of the strategic objectives over the next three years. As part of this process, a longer-term assessment of the prospects of the Group is also considered. Significant progress has been made by the Group against the strategic objectives announced in October 2016, including: - Broad-based progress made in key customer, supplier and colleague metrics: - Strong profit growth and free cash generation reflect the Group's focus on delivering cost savings and profitable sales growth: - A clear strategy focusing on customer satisfaction, cash profitability, free cash flow and earnings growth: - Synergies realised from the Booker merger completed in March 2018 are tracking ahead of plan: and - The Group has operations across a diversified set of geographies and business areas Retail, Banking and Customer Data Science. Refer to the Group Chief Executive's review on page 3 and the financial review on page 18 for further detail regarding the Group's strategic and financial progress. The following factors are considered both in the formulation of the Group's Strategic Plan, and in the longer term assessment of the Group's prospects: - The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, as well as emerging risks as they are identified, and how these can be addressed: - The prevailing economic climate and global economy, competitor activity, market dynamics and changing customer behaviours: - The potential short and longer term economic impact of Brexit: - The structural challenges facing retail and how the Group can best position itself to address these: - The value opportunities presented by further cost reduction through operational simplification and untapped growth potential across the Group: and - The resilience afforded by the Group's operational scale. Assessing the Group's viability. The viability of the Company has been assessed, taking into account the Company's current financial position, including external funding in place over the assessment period, and after modelling the impact of certain scenarios arising from the principal risks, which have the greatest potential impact on viability in that period. Four scenarios have been modelled, considered severe but plausible, that encompass these identified risks. None of these scenarios individually threaten the viability of the Company, therefore the compound impact of these scenarios has been evaluated as the most severe stress scenario. Scenario Associated principal risks Description Competitive pressure - Brand, reputation and trust - Competition and markets - Customer Failure to respond to fierce competition and changes in the retail market drives sustained significant like-for-like volume decline in core food categories with no offsetting price inflation, putting pressure on margins. Data security or regulatory breach - Brand, reputation and trust - Data security and data privacy - Political, regulatory and compliance A serious data security or regulatory breach results in a significant monetary penalty and a loss of reputation among customers. The modelling of this scenario is approached through a 'reverse-stress test' given the inherent uncertainty of value. Brexit impact - Competition and markets - Political, regulatory and compliance - Brexit Assumes a no-deal Brexit scenario which results in an increase to cost of goods and overhead costs. A broad assessment of the potential impact has been modelled including: higher import tariffs, higher sourcing costs from a weaker sterling, higher labour costs and the potential cost of customs friction from border controls. Appropriate mitigation options open to the Group have also been considered within this scenario. Reduction in cost savings and cash generation - Transformation - Liquidity Failure to achieve the Group's transformation objectives, resulting in an inability to progress sufficiently quickly to maintain or increase operating margin and generate sufficient cash to meet business objectives. These scenarios assumed that external debt is repaid as it becomes due and committed facilities renewed as they become due. The scenarios above are hypothetical and purposefully severe with the aim of creating outcomes that have the ability to threaten the viability of the Group. In the case of these scenarios arising, various options are available to the Group in order to maintain liquidity so as to continue in operation such as: i accessing new external funding early: ii more radical short-term cost reduction actions: and iii reducing capital expenditure. None of these actions are assumed in our current scenario modelling. Based on these severe but plausible scenarios, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period considered. This Strategic report, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, has been approved and signed on behalf of the Board.

        "Detailed Analysis of ROE": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is ROE increasing or declining?**  \n  The **ROE** has sharply declined from **0.498** in the previous year to **0.096** in the current year, indicating a significant deterioration in the company's return on equity.\n\n- **Is growth in ROE higher than that of competitors and the industry?**  \n  Based on the textual report, there is no explicit comparison with competitors or industry averages for **ROE**. However, the steep decline suggests the company is likely underperforming relative to peers, especially considering the strong operational and profit growth reported.\n\n- **Is growth persistent or temporary?**  \n  The decline in **ROE** appears **temporary** and possibly influenced by non-operational factors. The company reported strong growth in sales (+6.0%), adjusted operating profit (+58.0%), and adjusted diluted EPS (+88.8%), alongside a reduction in net debt and strong free cash flow. However, the sharp fall in **ROE** suggests increased equity or changes in accounting that diluted returns. The report mentions share consolidation and changes in accounting policies, which may have impacted equity and thus **ROE**.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected ROE next year:**  \n  Given the positive operational momentum (strong sales growth, profit increases, and a progressive dividend policy), **ROE** is expected to recover moderately next year, potentially reaching around **12-15%**, assuming continued efficiency improvements and capital management.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The company\u2019s **ROE** declined significantly from **0.498** to **0.096**, signaling a material reduction in efficiency at generating shareholder returns.  \n- Despite this, operational performance was strong with double-digit growth in adjusted operating profit and EPS, supported by effective cost control and market share gains.  \n- The decline in **ROE** likely reflects temporary accounting or capital structure factors such as share consolidation and equity base changes rather than deteriorating business fundamentals.  \n- Strong cash flow generation and a commitment to capital returns through dividends and share buybacks support a positive outlook for improving **ROE**.  \n- Risks include inflationary pressures and economic uncertainties which could impact margins and capital efficiency.  \n- The company\u2019s strategic focus on value, convenience, and sustainability positions it well for medium-term growth, supporting a rebound in **ROE**.  \n- Adjusting items and one-off charges also impact statutory measures but are excluded from adjusted profitability, suggesting underlying core performance remains robust.  \n- The pension surplus and reduction in net debt improve financial stability, potentially lowering equity costs and enhancing returns in future periods.  \n- Continued investment in online growth and convenience formats should drive revenue and margin expansion, positively influencing **ROE**.  \n- Overall, the sharp current decline in **ROE** is an outlier relative to strong fundamental growth and cash flow metrics.",
        "Detailed Analysis of ROE Drivers": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?**  \n  The **Assets Turnover** ratio decreased from **5.674** in the previous year to **5.189** in the current year, indicating a slight decline in efficiency. Meanwhile, the **Profit Margin** dropped sharply from **10.6%** to **2.45%**. This suggests that the growth in ROE is not driven by either efficiency or margin improvements; in fact, both have deteriorated, with margin suffering a more severe decline.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  The text does not provide explicit competitor or industry benchmarks, but the drastic fall in **Profit Margin** from over 10% to below 2.5% signals a weakening profitability position, likely below industry norms. The slight decline in **Assets Turnover** also points to reduced asset utilization efficiency. Taken together, these are likely below average compared to peers.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year:** Given the company\u2019s investments in online expansion and convenience stores, but also the challenges noted in supply chain and inflationary pressures, a moderate rebound or stabilization around **5.2 to 5.3** is expected.\n- **Expected Profit Margin next year:** With inflationary pressures and cost increases continuing, but offset by value initiatives and cost-saving programs, a cautious forecast projects a modest increase to around **3% to 4%**, though still below historical levels.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The company\u2019s **ROE decline** is driven by a combination of declining **Profit Margin** and reduced **Assets Turnover**, with margin deterioration being the more significant factor.\n- Despite strong sales growth and operational improvements reported in the textual analysis, profitability margins have been heavily compressed, indicating cost inflation and margin pressure.\n- The outlook is cautiously optimistic for a marginal recovery in asset efficiency and profit margins, supported by strategic investments and cost-saving measures, but full margin restoration will take time amid inflationary and competitive pressures.",
        "Detailed Analysis of Risk": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Are risks increasing or declining?**  \n  The **NLP financial risk** has increased slightly from **1.22** to **1.31**, indicating a marginal rise in financial risk. However, **NLP legal risk** has sharply declined from **0.57** to **0.07**, and **NLP tax risk** has decreased from **0.87** to **0.81**, showing an overall decline in legal and tax risks.\n\n- **Is the number and severity of risks higher than competitors/industry?**  \n  The **NLP specificity** has increased from **0.0899** to **0.1071**, suggesting more precise risk disclosures. Without direct competitor data, the increase in specificity and reduction in legal and tax risks imply a relatively improved risk profile and potentially better standing than some peers.\n\n- **Is sentiment increasing or declining?**  \n  The report reflects positive operational and strategic progress, supported by improvements in key financial metrics. Given that **sentiment-related measures** (inferred through risk and specificity) are stable or improving, sentiment appears to be **improving**.\n\n- **Is specificity increasing or declining?**  \n  The **NLP specificity** has improved from **0.0899** to **0.1071**, indicating enhanced clarity and precision in risk disclosure, improving transparency.\n\n- **Are complexity measures increasing or declining?**  \n  The **NLP sentence length** remained stable (~26.7 words), and **sentence depth** slightly increased from **6.54** to **6.57**, suggesting marginally increased complexity in risk-related disclosures.\n\n- **How are sentiment, specificity, and complexity compared to competitors?**  \n  While competitor benchmarks are not provided, the improvements in **specificity**, reduction in **legal and tax risks**, and stable to slightly increased **complexity** suggest that the company is providing more detailed and transparent risk information, which typically reflects positively relative to peers.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Is Gearing expected to increase next year?**  \n  The **Gearing ratio** improved from **2.41** to **1.93**, indicating deleveraging. Given strong free cash flow and debt reduction efforts, **Gearing is expected to decrease or remain stable** rather than increase next year.\n\n- **Is Current Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The **Current Ratio** improved from **0.65** to **0.73**, reflecting better short-term liquidity. With ongoing operational improvements, the **Current Ratio is expected to continue increasing**.\n\n- **Is Quick Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The **Quick Ratio** increased from **0.24** to **0.29**, indicating improved liquidity excluding inventories. Given the trend, the **Quick Ratio is expected to increase further**.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The company shows a **decline in legal and tax risks** while financial risks have marginally increased, indicating a more balanced risk profile.  \n- Enhanced **risk disclosure specificity** reflects improved transparency and communication quality, supporting stakeholder confidence.  \n- Key liquidity measures, including **Current and Quick Ratios**, have improved, suggesting strengthened short-term financial health.  \n- The **Gearing ratio reduction** highlights effective debt management and deleveraging efforts.  \n- Slightly increased complexity in disclosures may reflect more detailed and sophisticated risk reporting.  \n- Overall, the company is positioning itself for sustainable growth with controlled risk exposure and improved financial stability.",

The Group has defined and outlined the purpose of its APMs in the Glossary starting on page 207. During the year, the operating profit and EPS APMs were renamed. 'Operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' has changed to 'Adjusted operating profit'. 'Diluted EPS before exceptional and other items' has changed to 'Adjusted diluted EPS'. The Retail free cash flow APM was amended in order to provide a more consistent and predictable view of free cash flow generated by the Group's retail operation. 'Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' within operating profit, along with net pension finance costs, fair value remeasurements of financial instruments, and the tax impact of such items below operating profit, are now called 'Adjusting items'. The policy for determining adjusting items, and the items adjusted for, are unchanged from the prior year and hence there is no impact on previously reported APMs. a Adjusted operating profit and Adjusted diluted EPS exclude the impact of adjusting items. b The share base used in Adjusted diluted EPS in the prior year is adjusted to capture the full impact of the share consolidation which followed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, as if it took place at the start of the 2020 21 financial year. As such, Adjusted diluted EPS adjusted for share consolidation is presented on a basis other than in accordance with IAS 33. c The Group has changed its accounting policy for property buybacks in light of an evolution of accepted practice in relation to the application of IFRS 16 'Leases' to such transactions.

Living our new purpose Having a strong purpose is essential to the running of our business: it is what drives us forward and guides the decisions we make. Reflecting our commitment to the communities we serve and the wider environment, it is right that we have evolved our purpose: serving our customers, communities and planet a little better every day. A recent example of this is in response to the war in Ukraine. It is deeply sad to see the impact on the people of Ukraine and our thoughts are with everyone affected. As a business, we responded quickly, leveraging our partnership with the British Red Cross to provide help where it was needed. Thanks to the generosity of our customers and colleagues, together we have raised almost PS4m to help the Red Cross get vital support to those affected. While Tesco has no direct operations in either Russia or Ukraine, we are keeping a close eye on the evolving situation and its effect on the wider global economy. Everyone plays an important role in delivering on this purpose. It guides the discussions we have as a Board and we have played an active role in supporting the work of the Executive team when it comes to key issues such as health and the environment. This year, we are introducing new remuneration performance targets specifically related to our progress on key sustainability measures. This means that 25% of the Performance Share Plan awards will depend on our progress on gender and ethnicity representation, carbon reduction and food waste reduction in our own operations, subject to approval at the AGM see more on pages 80 to 82. The Board continues to engage with stakeholders both inside and outside the business see more on pages 20 to 22. As a business, we have a deep understanding of our customers, and the expertise in our team to help drive progress. For example, our team of chefs and product developers have been working to improve the health profile of our products without affecting taste, as we work to increase the number of healthy products, as a proportion of sales, to 65% by 2025. A new chapter In October 2021, we set out the new strategic priorities and performance framework for the business see pages 14 and 15. In this next chapter, Tesco will focus on driving greater value for all stakeholders - doing the basics brilliantly and leveraging our many unique advantages across the Tesco Group to enhance competitiveness, accelerate growth and generate cash. We will also deliver ongoing capital returns to shareholders, through our progressive dividend policy and share buyback programme. We have set a full-year dividend of 10.90p and a commitment to repurchase shares worth PS750m over the next 12 months. Strong growth By remaining customer-focused at all times, Tesco has delivered a strong full-year performance, with Group sales increasing 2.5% at actual rates and adjusted operating profit reaching PS2.8bn. The work we have done in the UK last year means we are winning customers from our competitors, with overall customer perception of the brand stepping forward once again across value and quality. Our Brand index stepped forward by 9bps in the year, on top of exceptional growth last year. This year has demonstrated the resilience of our supply chains and strong partnerships we have built with suppliers. Many businesses experienced disruption in their supply chains including from COVID-19, labour shortages and post-Brexit restrictions. These have all impacted the way we work, but thanks to extensive planning and an agile response, we were able to protect availability for customers. Board changes In January, we announced that Steve Golsby and Simon Patterson will retire from the Board at this year's AGM. Both Steve and Simon have made valuable contributions to the Tesco team over many years and I wish them all the best in the future. Steve Golsby will also step down from his role as Chair of the Remuneration Committee and will be succeeded by Alison Platt. Looking ahead On behalf of myself and the Board, I would like to thank colleagues across the Group for their continued commitment and hard work over the past 12 months. We have overcome many obstacles together, and I am sure there will be more to come, but the new purpose and strategic priorities will steer us on the path of building a stronger and more sustainable business that we can continue to be proud of. John Allan CBE Non-executive Chairman 12 April 2022 Creating long-term sustainable value. Strategic report 9 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 The momentum in our business is strong and with a refreshed purpose and new strategic priorities, there is energy and drive to keep growing and innovating. Group Chief Executive's review This year, we have turned the pages on a new chapter. Our new purpose and strategic priorities will set us up to be even more competitive in the future, building on the fantastic work done to date. I want to thank the Tesco team for their hard work and for the way colleagues have supported each other through the challenges of the last year. The culture within Tesco is one of our unique strengths, guided by our values that no one tries harder for customers, we treat people how they want to be treated and every little help makes a big difference. Driven by our strengths As we developed the plans that will enable our next chapter, we wanted to truly understand what our strengths are, how the market is moving and what we need to do to better serve customers in the future. The result is a new set of strategic priorities for the Group and a performance framework to help track our progress over the coming years. We have the right plans in place, and our colleagues have embraced them wholeheartedly. Our new purpose Tesco is more than a supermarket to its customers, and colleagues agreed that we needed to broaden our purpose for a world where our customers still expect us to serve them as shoppers, but also as contributors to their community and to the wider world. We have therefore updated our purpose to be 'Serving our customers, communities and planet a little better every day'. The word 'customer' better encompasses how we serve people across the Tesco Group - from Tesco shoppers and Bank customers to Booker retail partners and dunnhumby's global clients. By acknowledging our communities and the planet within our purpose, we ensure they are factored into every decision we make. With the COP26 Climate Conference hosted in Glasgow in 2021, we set out our own Climate Manifesto Tesco PLC: A Better Basket. Tesco's journey on climate action started many years ago, but this year we have worked to be even more ambitious and accelerate our progress. Our UK target to be carbon neutral in our own operations by 2035 was this year extended to cover the whole Group and we committed to achieving net zero emissions across our entire value chain by 2050, including those generated by the products we sell and across our supply chains. Meeting these targets will be challenging. It will need transformational change as well as close collaboration with our suppliers and customers, but it is essential if we are to tackle the climate crisis see more on page 40. In February 2022, we were all deeply distressed to see the crisis unfold in Ukraine. Our hearts go out to everyone affected. We have been working alongside the British Red Cross to offer help in the most practical ways we can. Together with customers, we have raised almost PS4m to the British Red Cross, as well as PS500,000 to humanitarian organisations in Central Europe. We are also leveraging our distribution network in Central Europe to get supplies where they are most needed: supporting Ukrainian refugees to access Tesco jobs in all our markets: and removing fees from Tesco Bank transfers to Ukraine or Tesco mobile calls to Ukraine. We will continue to respond to the evolving situation. Our strategic priorities The new strategic priorities and performance framework for the Group are set out in more detail on pages 14 and 15. Magnetic value for customers Magnetic value is the combination of price, quality, range, customer experience - and it is also the work we do to bring value to communities and the planet more broadly, through our work on health and sustainability. This strategic priority is all about providing reliable value that removes customers' needs to shop elsewhere, combined with positive reasons to shop more with us. I love my Tesco Clubcard More than 20 million households have a Clubcard, and going forward, we will be making even greater use of insight to make the shopping experience more personalised and relevant. Combining Clubcard with our online grocery business, our nine million regular app users and the capability offered by dunnhumby, we have the opportunity to create additional value and increase loyalty. Easily the most convenient To be convenient now means serving customers wherever, whenever and however they want to be served. We believe we can do that better than anyone by leveraging our existing reach and strong network. We will continue to adapt, while at the same time seeking capital-light growth opportunities in the two key growth channels of online and convenience. Save to invest To give us the fuel to invest in our priorities and to offset inflationary pressures, we need to continue our longstanding approach of being as simple, agile and productive as we can be. We want to make sure we only spend money where it adds value for customers and, in total, we are aiming for around PS1bn of savings across a range of areas over the next three years. 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 Taken together, these priorities will ensure we do the basics brilliantly, operate as efficiently as possible, embed sustainability in every decision we make and grow our business by building on our unique strengths. Our colleagues will be pivotal in delivering our strategic priorities, and bringing them to life in a way that makes a difference for our customers and stakeholders. Performance framework To track our progress, we set out measures in a multi-year performance framework. We are seeking to grow the top line, underpinned by increasing customer satisfaction and adding capital-light opportunities in convenience and online. We are aiming to grow, or at least maintain, market share in our core UK market. We are also seeking to grow absolute profits in quantum terms. We will target productivity savings to at least offset inflation in the medium term and ideally create headroom to invest in our other strategic priorities. By doing this, we are clear that we can generate between PS1.4bn and PS1.8bn of Retail free cash flow each year. Significant progress As we developed and set out our strategic priorities, we did not take our foot off the pedal for our customers. After a challenging few years, we know that rising inflation is really at the front of customers' minds. Our commitment to value is unwavering, and now more than ever, it is essential that customers can rely on Tesco for value. Through our powerful combination of Aldi Price Match, Low Everyday Prices and Clubcard Prices, we are making more products more affordable, in more places than anyone else on the market. Clubcard remains a key driver of loyalty, used by more than 20 million UK households. 100% of UK promotions are through Clubcard Prices and we are bringing the benefits of the Tesco family to Clubcard holders, with Tesco Bank recently launching Clubcard Pay, a new way to pay, save and pick up extra Clubcard points. As we aim to be even more convenient for our customers, we have grown our online businesses in every region and introduced rapid delivery in the UK through Tesco Whoosh, now available in over 200 stores. We have also demonstrated innovation in the way we improve the quality and sustainability of our products. We have increased the number of vegetables in our ready meals, introduced sustainable packaging solutions including refillable cleaning products and, in partnership with WWF, launched the Tesco Innovation Fund, enabling start-ups to get vital seed funding for ideas that make food production more sustainable. I would like to thank our suppliers for embracing innovation with us and working towards an even stronger partnership. We are pleased that suppliers have voted Tesco top of the independent Advantage survey for six years running. From a team perspective, I am delighted that Guus Dekkers, our Chief Technology Officer, has been appointed to the Executive Committee. As technology plays a more central role in our business, his appointment reiterates the growing importance we assign to technology and digitalisation going forward. I am also delighted to welcome Emma Taylor to the Executive Committee as Chief People Officer. Emma has been promoted from her role as People Director UK & ROI and will take over from Natasha Adams as Chief People Officer. Natasha will stay on the Executive Committee, and relocate to Ireland in her new role as CEO of Tesco Ireland. Well positioned to deliver for our stakeholders For shareholders, our strong performance to date and our confidence in our ability to generate cash in the coming years, have enabled us to announce the start of a share buyback programme that will balance the maintenance of a strong capital structure with returning surplus cash. Recognised for our efforts on sustainability Our sustainability efforts are grounded in doing the right thing for our customers, communities and the planet and we were pleased to be recognised with numerous awards this year. Highlights included qualifying for the Top 100 Stonewall Equality Index, being named the MSC Supermarket of the Year 2021 and achieving leading retailer status within the World Benchmarking Alliance Food and Agriculture Benchmark. In November 2021, we were proud to be awarded the Terra Carta seal in recognition of our leadership role in transitioning towards a net zero future. com sustainability We are also committed to our progressive dividend policy and are pleased to pay a full-year dividend of 10.90p. The work we have done this year and the progress we have made with our customers gives me confidence that we are on the right path to achieve sustainable growth in the future. Together, we will build on our success over the past year, sustain our position, deliver against our strategic priorities and in doing so, accelerate our momentum. Above all, we will make the most of our unique strengths and the fantastic team of colleagues helping us to serve our customers, communities and planet a little better every day. Ken Murphy Group Chief Executive 12 April 2022 Strategic report 11 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 What is your highlight this year? We hosted an event for colleagues in September to talk about the new strategic priorities and purpose. During the Q&A session, the questions really struck me. Colleagues asked 'How can I get involved personally and make more of a contribution to my community and the planet?' or 'I have so many ideas - how can I share them?' I have been humbled by the positive engagement from colleagues and knowing they feel connected with the new purpose and strategy. How are you embedding the new purpose across the business? It is a core part of delivering our strategy and it needs to happen at every level - from shop floor to boardroom. The Group Leadership Team was heavily involved in the journey as we set out our strategy and after we launched our purpose, myself, Jason Tarry and other Exec members travelled around the UK and Ireland to host townhall sessions with colleagues, to hear their feedback and respond to questions. Why was it important to call out Communities and Planet in the purpose? For a long time, Tesco has been an active member in local communities and our work to reduce our environmental impact started many years ago. We recognise that the future of our business depends not only on the actions we take, but also on the world around us. With the urgent need to tackle the climate crisis and address big social issues like food poverty and inclusion, it was right to reflect these commitments in our everyday decision making. Why is there no Little Helps Plan report this year? We want to seize the opportunity of the new purpose and strategy to reset our sustainability reporting and reflect the deeper integration of sustainability across our business and the needs of our stakeholders. So, from now on, we will report progress on our material sustainability issues within our Annual Report and provide comprehensive updates across the full breadth of sustainability issues on our dedicated online reporting hub. To find out more, please visit www. What are Tesco's sustainability priorities and why? We always listen to our customers, colleagues and wider stakeholders to understand which sustainability issues matter most and where Tesco can make the greatest difference and drive transformative change. In adopting the principles of double materiality, we have identified four broad issue areas we want to lead on: climate change: healthy, sustainable diets: packaging & waste: and diversity & inclusion. Is Tesco doing enough to combat climate change? As part of our commitment to be carbon neutral in our own Group operations by 2035 and across our entire value chain by 2050, we are working to drive improvements at every point in our food system - in our own operations, in our supply chain, and in our customers' homes. We know there is more to do and we are building decarbonisation pathways, identifying the actions required to achieve our net zero ambition. What progress have you made towards your health targets? We are constantly reformulating our products to improve the health profile and in the last year we have taken out a further 7.7 billion calories. Our new ranges make it easier for customers to eat more fruit and veg, such as our Meat & Veg range, but there's plenty more to do across our markets as we work towards our target to increase sales of healthy products. This year, performance has not progressed, as a result of some product consolidation to keep supply moving as well as the transfer of less healthy choices from hospitality to retailers. What are the key priorities for the year ahead? I'm excited about the momentum we are building. We have a formula that is working and that we can build on and accelerate. For me, it's about really making progress against those key strategic priorities. There's plenty of exciting innovation in the pipeline - in product development, channels and customer experience. For example, we are aiming to extend our Whoosh rapid delivery service to 600 Express stores by the end of the year. Group Chief Executive's review continued How are you delivering value for shareholders? From our performance this year, we're gaining share against all the key competitors. Customers are recognising the tangible improvements we're making in our offer, which is driving outperformance against the market. I believe that Tesco is an outstanding business and one that can create significant value for shareholders. How we use cash is incredibly important, and we have taken great care to test every element of our capital allocation framework - refreshing our leverage target, the application of our dividend policy and launching our first share buyback. We have returned PS300m of capital through our share buyback programme to date, and commit to a further PS750m by April 2023. How are you recognising the extraordinary efforts of colleagues this year? Colleagues truly are at the heart of our business and their skills and capabilities have enabled us to deliver for our customers through the challenges of recent times. We recently reached an agreement with USDAW for a substantial increase in UK base pay - by 5.8% to PS10.10 for hourly-paid store and customer fulfilment centre CFC colleagues. We have also announced a one-off thank you payment of 1.25% of annual earnings to hourly-paid store, CFC and customer engagement centre colleagues in the UK. This payment recognises the contribution of our colleagues and is part of a wider investment in making Tesco a great place to work, which includes supporting their physical and mental wellbeing, both in and out of work and building an inclusive culture where everyone feels welcome. What is your outlook for the year ahead? As we build on our momentum over the coming year we believe that it is important to remain focused on championing great value. We expect to see a normalisation in customer behaviour as we come out of the pandemic, but the exact scale and timing of this is difficult to assess. We're also expecting continued cost inflation through the year. Overall, we expect to deliver retail adjusted operating profit of between PS2.4bn and PS2.6bn for FY 2022 23. 12 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 Group sales d increased by 3.0% at constant rates, with growth across all regions on top of exceptionally strong sales last year. Revenue increased by 6.4% at constant rates including fuel sales growth of 48.1% as customers travelled more following the easing of government restrictions. While two-year like-for-like h fuel sales growth was negative at 6.4 %, this primarily reflects lower demand in the first half, with fuel sales ahead of pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. Group adjusted operating profit e grew by 58.9% at constant rates, reflecting the strong sales performance across the retail businesses, a reduction in COVID-19 related costs and a return to profitability in Tesco Bank. These benefits were partially offset by inflationary pressures in the cost base, particularly in distribution costs. Group statutory operating profit, which includes adjusting items related to the costs of historical shareholder litigation claims, grew by 65.5%. Finance income and finance costs reduced year-on-year primarily due to fair value remeasurement gains related to the mark-tomarket movement on inflation-linked swaps, which were a PS123m benefit this year compared to a PS 214 m charge in the prior year. The reduction in our share of profit from joint ventures and associates was principally due to profit from Tesco Underwriting Group review of performance. Financial review being recognised within Tesco Bank operating profit following its full acquisition in May. The increase in tax this year primarily reflects higher levels of both retail and Tesco Bank operating profit, in addition to the revaluation of deferred tax relating to the announced change in the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective 1 April 2023. Our adjusted diluted EPS e, g rose by 88.8%, reflecting the increase in retail and Tesco Bank operating profit and a reduction in net finance costs. We have proposed a final dividend of 7.70 pence per ordinary share, taking the full-year dividend to 10.90 pence per ordinary share, an increase of 19.1% year-on-year. Net debt b, f reduced by PS1.4bn year-on-year, primarily driven by strong free cash flow generation. Retail free cash flow f increased by PS0.9bn year-on-year due to higher retail operating profits, the elimination of UK pension contributions following the PS2.5bn one-off contribution last year from the Asia disposal proceeds and a working capital benefit from higher sales. These benefits were partly offset by an increase in capital expenditure. The Net debt EBITDA ratio was 2.5 times at the year end, compared to 3.3 times last year.

During the year, the operating profit and EPS APMs were renamed. Profit has changed from 'Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' to 'Adjusted operating profit'. EPS has changed from 'Diluted EPS before exceptional and other items' to 'Adjusted diluted EPS'. The Retail free cash flow APM was amended in order to provide a more consistent and predictable view of free cash flow generated by the Group's retail operation. 'Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' within operating profit, along with net pension finance costs, fair value remeasurements of financial instruments, and the tax impact of such items below operating profit, are now called 'Adjusting items'. The policy for determining adjusting items, and the items adjusted for, are unchanged from the prior year and hence there is no impact on previously reported APMs. b All measures apart from Net debt are shown on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated. Further details on discontinued operations can be found in Note 7, starting on page 140. c The Group has changed its accounting policy for property buybacks in light of an evolution of accepted practice in relation to the application of IFRS 16 'Leases' to such transactions. Comparatives have been restated for this change in accounting policy see Note 1 on page 122 for further details. d Group sales exclude VAT and fuel. Sales change shown on a comparable days basis for Central Europe. e Adjusted operating profit and Adjusted diluted EPS exclude Adjusting items as noted in footnote a. f Net debt and Retail free cash flow exclude Tesco Bank. g The share base used in Adjusted diluted EPS in the prior year is adjusted to capture the full impact of the share consolidation which followed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, as if it took place at the start of the 2020 21 financial year. As such, Adjusted diluted EPS adjusted for share consolidation is presented on a basis other than in accordance with IAS 33. Please see page 210 for a reconciliation to Adjusted diluted EPS. Like-for-like is a measure of growth in Group online sales and sales from stores that have been open for at least a year at constant exchange rates, excluding VAT and fuel. h Like-for-like is a measure of growth in Group online sales and sales from stores that have been open for at least a year at constant exchange rates, excluding VAT and fuel. i Capex excludes additions arising from business combinations and buybacks of properties typically stores, as well as additions relating to decommissioning provisions and similar items. 23 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 Strategic report Financial review continued UK & ROI overview In the UK & ROI, one-year like-for-like sales increased by 2.2% on top of exceptional growth last year, driven by a sharp recovery in Booker catering sales, strong non-food sales in the UK & ROI and sustained market outperformance in the UK. Two-year like-for-like sales increased by 8.8% with all businesses growing versus pre-pandemic levels. UK & ROI adjusted operating profit was PS2,481m, up 35.4% at constant rates as higher sales volumes and lower COVID-19 costs year-on-year offset underlying operating cost inflation. In the UK, we continued to incur COVID-19 related costs, primarily relating to colleague absence for those colleagues who were sick or self-isolating and additional costs related to sustained elevated online sales. Total COVID-19 related costs were PS 220 m, significantly less than the PS 892 m incurred last year. Our assumption for the current year is that we will incur a significantly lower level of COVID-19 costs as colleague absence rates return to pre-pandemic levels. Around PS 80 m of residual costs will remain, relating to increased online demand, however we do not plan to report these separately going forwards. Adjusted operating margin was up 94 basis points versus last year. Our core UK business benefited from strong growth in higher margin clothing sales, including an increase in full price sales from 77% last year to 86% this year, and Booker profitability recovered as catering demand increased following the reopening of the hospitality sector. Lower COVID-19 related costs were partly offset by our investments in value and service. We were able to more than offset inflationary pressures in the cost base this year with cost savings related to further simplifying our operating model. UK - strong market outperformance, with sales growth on a one-year and two-year basis One-year like-for-like sales grew by 0.4%, including growth of 1.2% in the first half before sales declined by 0.5 % in the second half as we traded over elevated demand during the second and third national lockdowns in the prior year. First half growth was driven by non-food and increased levels of discretionary spend compared to last year, when footfall in stores was lower and customers prioritised spending on food during the first national lockdown. In the second half, food sales declined as customers were able to return to eating more out of home, and reflected very strong comparators last year, including double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. We sought to mitigate as much price inflation as possible, ending the year with our strongest relative price position in over six years. Our ongoing value investments and a higher promotional participation meant we saw sales deflation for the year as a whole, but with inflation increasing during the second half of the year, as the grocery market faced significant cost pressures. Two-year like-for-like sales grew by 8.2%, with growth both in stores and online, and in food and non-food. Average basket sizes across the business remained higher than pre-pandemic levels, partially offset by fewer shopping trips. Our relentless focus on providing customers with great value and service resulted in consistent outperformance against the market throughout the year. Our UK market share reached its highest level in over four years and we saw 23 consecutive periods of net switching gains. We gained market share in the year on both a value and volume basis, with volume growing ahead of value as we did everything we could to minimise inflation for our customers. We have market leading two-year improvements in brand index 413bps, value 483bps and quality 385bps perception. During the year we extended Clubcard Prices to all Express stores, increasing Clubcard sales penetration by 21%pts year-on-year in those stores. Clubcard penetration in large stores was 86%, increasing by 7%pts year-on-year. Online one-year like-for-like sales declined by 6.5 % as some customers chose to return to shopping in our stores as the pandemic eased. Online sales participation was 14% across the full year, with a peak during the first quarter of 15.5%. Two-year like-for-like sales grew by 66.1% and sales participation in online was 5% higher than before the pandemic, driven by both a sustained increase in orders and higher basket sizes. We have added PS2.3bn of online sales and fulfilled an average of over 1.2 million customer orders per week versus 0.7 million pre-pandemic. Segmental review of performance Sales performance: exc.

The fifth UFC is expected to open next month, in Rutherglen. Following encouraging initial trials, we expanded 'Tesco Whoosh' - our 60-minute delivery service - from 50 stores in the first half to over 200 stores by the end of the year. We offer customers more than 1,700 products, including fresh food, and delivery slots are available between 7am and 10pm, every day. We plan to roll the service out to 600 stores over the coming year. In October, we launched a pilot with Gorillas in our Thornton Heath store in London, offering customers grocery deliveries within ten minutes on a range of 2,000 products. Convenience one-year like-for-like sales declined by 0.8 %, with a decline in the first half partially offset by growth of 4.0% in the second half as footfall in city centres recovered. Growth was particularly strong in our 'on the go' stores and in 'food to go' and 'food for tonight' ranges, where sales grew by 34.9% and 21.6% respectively. Sales in our stores in neighbourhood locations declined following very high levels of demand last year as customers shopped closer to home. Non-food sales growth was particularly strong this year, driven mainly by Clothing 19.4% as customers spent more time shopping our ranges in-store and we responded to changing customer demand in our ranges. Growth was particularly strong in Womenswear and Kids, and benefited from a rebalancing of space between Clothing and General Merchandise, now completed in 116 of our large stores, making Clothing more of a destination shop and making our food-adjacent General Merchandise ranges simpler and easier to shop. Food sales were marginally behind last year, down 0.4 %, driven mainly by lower demand in those categories which benefited from elevated levels of in-home consumption last year, including meat, fish & poultry, and grocery. Demand for plant-based products continues to grow at pace, with sales of plant-based meat alternatives growing by 130% since our 2018 base line. We expanded our plant-based ranges further in the year, launching an additional 173 products, including our Wicked Kitchen meal deal in January on a two-year basis. Total 'UK like-for-like' sales grew across all categories, with a particularly strong contribution from food. We rolled out soft plastic recycling facilities across all of our large UK stores and launched an innovative Reuse proposition in 10 stores as we continue to tackle plastic waste. We removed an additional 600 million pieces of plastic from our packaging this year, taking the cumulative total pieces of plastic removed over the past two years to 1.6 billion. We removed a further 7.7 billion calories from our own brand ranges as part of our work towards achieving 65% of our sales from healthy products by 2025. Our 'Buy One to Help a Child' campaign - where we gave a donation for every piece of fruit and vegetables purchased across our stores and online - provided FareShare with 3 million meals-worth of food to help charities and community groups. In September, we announced accelerated climate ambitions, bringing forward our Group own operations net zero target to 2035. We also launched a new goal to be net zero across our entire value chain by 2050, aligned to a 1.5degC pathway. We continued to roll out electric online delivery vans, set up new renewable energy projects and launched our first two electric HGVs in our distribution operations this year. We also launched our  supply-chain financing programme and issued our second  bond. In November, we were delighted to be awarded the Prince of Wales's Terra Carta Seal in recognition of our commitment to and momentum towards a climate and nature-positive future. ROI - one-year LFL 2.9 % reflecting higher demand last year: 10.6% growth on a two-year basis One-year like-for-like sales declined by 2.9 % as we traded over exceptional COVID-19 demand last year. The COVID-19 impact was particularly strong in ROI as the restrictions on hospitality were in place for a longer period than in the UK. Despite the exceptionally strong comparative, ROI like-for-like sales grew by 0.3% over Christmas and we gained market share in the fourth quarter. Two-year like-for-like sales grew by 10.6%, reflecting a significant benefit from retained levels of higher in-home consumption. Our online business grew by 3.1% on a one-year basis and now represents 8% of our sales. We have maintained a leading position, with a market share of 59%. We expanded our online offering further this year, rolling out an additional 37 Click & Collect locations and increasing our total slot capacity by 69%. We launched Aldi Price Match in ROI in January, with hundreds of products matched. We have started to roll out Clubcard Prices, following successful Clubcard Prices Events. We also focused on making shopping easier for customers, including rolling out 'Scan As You Shop' to all large stores. We announced an intention to acquire 10 Joyce's Supermarkets in Galway in November. The acquisition is subject to the approval of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. BOOKER - strong sales growth on both a one-year and two-year basis LFL sales change Sales One-year Two-year Retail PS4,651m 0.7% 19.3% Retail exc. BFL PS1,687m 52.0% 1.6 % Best Food Logistics BFL PS1,179m 62.5% n a Total Booker PS7,755m 15.3% 11.9% Total Booker also include small business sales of PS238m. Booker delivered double-digit like-for-like sales growth on both a one-year and two-year basis. One-year growth of 15.3% was driven by a sharp recovery in catering sales as hospitality outlets reopened, with a strong contribution from Best Food Logistics, the majority of whose customers are fast-service restaurants. Two-year catering sales declined by 1.6 % in total, impacted by the phased reopening of the hospitality sector in the first half. In the second half catering sales were ahead of pre-pandemic levels, with growth of 9.6% supported by strong execution and competitive pricing. Strategic report 25 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 In the retail business, one-year like-for-like sales grew 0.7%, primarily due to inflation in tobacco driven by annual duty increases. Retail sales excluding tobacco were marginally lower than last year as we lapped a strong uplift in neighbourhood-based convenience stores as customers shopped closer to home. Despite supply chain challenges, we delivered a resilient performance and gained new customers. Two-year retail like-for-like sales grew 19.3% driven by strong customer retention. CENTRAL EUROPE - growth across all channels and categories on a one-year and two-year like-for-like basis Like-for-like sales grew by 2.9% on a one-year basis and by 2.5% on a two-year basis, with growth across all channels and categories. Growth was particularly strong in Slovakia and Hungary, and in our compact hypermarket and supermarket formats as customer footfall improved and we were able to offer our full range following non-food selling restrictions last year. Trading conditions were more challenging in the Czech Republic, due to non-food sales restrictions in the first quarter. Non-food sales grew by 13.3%, with strong growth in both Clothing and General Merchandise. We saw a particularly positive customer response to our seasonal events. Customer net promoter score improved significantly across all markets year-on-year, driven by improvements in the shopping trip, with scores almost doubling by the end of the year for the region as a whole. We continued to strengthen our value proposition in the region, including the launch of Clubcard Prices Events in Slovakia and Hungary. Clubcard penetration increased during these events as customers accessed market-leading prices. Following the success of these initial events, we will expand Clubcard Prices to all markets and categories in the current year. Central Europe adjusted operating profit was PS168m, an increase of 41.1% at constant rates. Adjusted operating profit growth was driven by strong sales, lower COVID-19 related costs and higher margins from more full-priced non-food sales. We have agreed the sale of 17 malls and one retail park in Central Europe. The transaction is expected to complete in the first half of the current year, generating proceeds of c. PS200m and resulting in a c. PS 12 m impact to adjusted operating profit in the current year, driven by a reduction in mall income. We will continue to operate the Tesco hypermarkets in the malls on a long-term leasehold basis. TESCO BANK - year-on-year profit increase reflecting prior year COVID-19 impact on potential bad debts This year Last year YoY Revenue PS922m PS735m 25.4% Adjusted operating profit loss PS176m PS 175 m n m Lending to customers PS6.5bn PS6.4bn 1.6% Customer deposits PS 5.3 bn PS 5.7 bn 7.0% Net interest margin a 5.0% 4.7% 0.3%pts Total capital ratio b 27.2% 28.5% 2.4 %pts a The prior period net interest margin has been restated from 5.2% to 4.7%. b The prior period total capital ratio has been restated from 28.4% to 28.5%. Revenue grew by 25.4%, due to the benefit of the full acquisition of Tesco Underwriting which completed in May 2021. Revenue excluding Tesco Underwriting declined by 9.4 %, primarily as a result of lower income from unsecured lending due to lower average balances as customers paid down their debt during the pandemic, or increased savings buffers which reduced the need for new credit. We did however see a strong recovery in credit card customers' spending levels and in new business unsecured lending volumes. ATM transactions increased by 13.6% year-on-year as cash usage recovered post-lockdown. Travel money continued to be impacted by the pandemic and international travel restrictions, although we saw an encouraging increase in demand at the end of the year as restrictions eased. Tesco Bank adjusted operating profit was PS176m, including a PS13m contribution from Tesco Underwriting being fully consolidated. The significant recovery reflects the charge last year related to an increase in the provision for potential bad debts which accounted for the anticipated macroeconomic impact from COVID-19. We released part of this provision in the second half as the macroeconomic outlook improved and customer defaults remained low. We then recognised a separate provision in the second half to reflect the increased risk associated with cost of living pressures. The Bank's balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have sufficient capital and liquidity to absorb changes in both regulatory and funding requirements. In recognition of the sharp recovery in profitability in the year, the Bank paid a dividend of PS87m to the Group. This comprises the typical annual PS50m dividend for the 2021 22 financial year and a catch-up of PS37m in relation to the reduced payment of PS13m in the prior year. Tesco Bank won 'Best Overall Provider' at the 2021 YourMoney Awards, in recognition of the quality of our customer service and competitive pricing of our products. We introduced a number of new products and services for customers this year including Clubcard Pay in January. We also expanded our offer with the relaunch of travel insurance. Since August, all new and renewing Tesco Bank car and home insurance policies are being underwritten by Tesco Underwriting following the completion of its acquisition in May. Adjusting items in statutory operating profit This year Last year Litigation costs PS 193 m PS 93 m Property transactions PS128m PS26m Net impairment reversal of non-current assets PS 115 m PS128m Amortisation of acquired intangible assets PS 76 m PS 76 m Restructuring provisions PS 44 m - Asia licence fee income PS26m - Disposal of China associate Fair value less cost of disposal movements on assets held for sale PS15m PS 6 m - - Impairment charge on Tesco Bank goodwill - PS 295 m UK - ATM business rates - PS105m Booker integration costs - PS 25 m GMP equalisation - PS 7 m Employee share scheme - PS 4 m Total adjusting items in statutory operating profit PS 265 m PS 241 m Adjusting items are excluded from our adjusted operating profit performance by virtue of their size and nature to provide a helpful alternative perspective of the year-on-year performance of the Group's ongoing trading business. Total adjusting items in statutory operating profit in the year resulted in a charge of PS 265 m, compared to a charge of PS 241 m in the prior year. In September 2020, two claimant law firms issued proceedings against us in relation to the overstatement of expected profit announced in 2014. These claims have now been settled and we have recognised an adjusting charge of PS 193 m. The settlement of these claims was paid in full in the year, PS 105 m in the first half and PS 88 m in the second half. This cash outflow is presented within adjusting cash items. Given that the legal timeframe for bringing a claim has now elapsed, no further related claims can be brought by shareholders. Financial review continued 26 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 A non-cash fair value remeasurement credit of PS123m primarily related to the mark-to-market movement on inflation-linked swaps, driven by the impact of an increase in expected future inflation rates. These swaps eliminate the impact of future inflation on the Group's cash flow in relation to historical sale and leaseback property transactions. Net pension finance costs of PS 22 m decreased by PS21m, primarily driven by a reduction in the pension deficit following the PS2.5bn one-off contribution made in the prior year from the proceeds from the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia. We expect net pension finance income of PS79m in the current year as a result of the closing IAS 19 pension surplus. In February, we exercised the option to buy back our partner's equity in the Tesco Dorney Limited Partnership property joint venture. We expect the transaction to complete towards the end of our 2022 23 financial year, bringing seven large stores back into full ownership. This will result in annual cash rental savings of c. PS30m and a c. PS 0.3 bn increase in net debt, comprising a c. PS 0.7 bn impact on borrowings, partially offset by a c. PS0.4bn reduction in lease liabilities. Following this transaction, we will have five UK property JV structures still in place, from a peak of 13 structures in 2015. These five remaining structures contain property worth PS3.2bn and debt of PS2.1bn, with PS1.9bn of associated lease liabilities on our balance sheet. The three largest of our remaining property JVs are with the Tesco Pension fund. Further detail on finance income and costs can be found in Note 5 on page 137, as well as further detail on the adjusting items in Note 4 on page 136. Group tax This year Last year Tax on adjusted profit PS 502 m PS 249 m Tax on adjusting items PS 8 m PS145m Tax on profit PS 510 m PS 104 m Tax on adjusted Group profit was PS 502 m, PS 253 m higher than last year, reflecting higher levels of both retail and Tesco Bank operating profit, in addition to a one-off charge related to the revaluation of deferred tax, following the announced increase in the corporation tax rate in the UK from 19% to 25%, effective 1 April 2023. The effective tax rate on adjusted Group profit was 22.8%, higher than the current UK statutory rate of 19%, primarily due to the revaluation of deferred tax. The banking surcharge levied on Tesco Bank profit and depreciation of assets which do not qualify for tax relief also increased the tax rate. We expect an adjusted effective tax rate of between 21% and 22% in the current financial year. We forecast our adjusted effective tax rate to increase to around 26% from our 2023 24 financial year driven by the increase in the UK corporation tax rate in April 2023. Further detail on Group tax can be found in Note 6 on page 138. Total Group cash tax paid in the year was PS 199 m on a continuing operations basis, which included PS 152 m of tax paid in the UK. Tax paid in the year was PS 29 m higher than in the prior year, primarily due to higher levels of retail and Tesco Bank operating profit. This was partly offset by prior-year tax losses and a benefit from the super-deduction allowance on certain capital investments, introduced in the Chancellor's budget in March 2021, along with PS120m in relation to the PS2.5bn one-off pension contribution made in the prior year, the relief for which is required to be spread over four years for tax purposes. We recognised an adjusting credit of PS128m related to the profit generated on disposal of properties in the year. The majority of the property profits recognised related to the sale of our Fenny Lock distribution centre which generated proceeds of PS146m and a PS103m profit on disposal. During the year, the Group recognised a net impairment charge of PS 115 m on non-current assets. This includes PS 62 m required as a result of the Group's acquisition of our partner's stake in The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership joint venture which brought into full ownership 11 stores. The remaining charge largely reflects normal fluctuations in store level performance, property fair values and changes in discount rates, as well as any specific store closures. Amortisation of acquired intangible assets is excluded from our headline performance measures. We incurred a charge of PS 76 m in the period, which primarily relates to our merger with Booker in March 2018, which resulted in the recognition of PS755m of intangible assets. Restructuring provisions of PS 44 m were recognised in the second half, relating to operational restructuring changes announced in February 2022 as part of our 'Save to Invest' programme. We received software licence fee income of PS26m from services provided to CP Group following the sale of our businesses in Asia. Further detail on adjusting items can be found in Note 4, starting on page 136. Joint ventures and associates Our share of post-tax profits from joint ventures and associates was PS15m, compared to PS26m in the prior year. The year-on-year reduction was primarily due to profits from Tesco Underwriting Limited now being recognised in Tesco Bank adjusted operating profit following its full acquisition in May 2021 and a reduction in profits generated by our Trent Hypermarket Limited joint venture in India due to the adverse trading impacts of COVID-19 in the year. Net finance costs This year Last year Net interest on medium term notes, loans and bonds PS 208 m PS 218 m Other interest receivable and similar income PS9m PS15m Other finance charges and interest payable PS 39 m PS 31 m Finance charges payable on lease liabilities PS 405 m PS 446 m Net finance costs before net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments PS 643 m PS 680 m Fair value remeasurements of financial instruments PS123m PS 214 m Net pension finance costs PS 22 m PS 43 m Net finance costs PS 542 m PS 937 m Net interest on medium term notes, loans and bonds was PS 208 m, down PS10m year-on-year. The reduction in finance costs from bond maturities, tenders and new debt issuances at lower rates of interest was largely offset by interest payable on the PS 453 m of net debt we acquired with The Tesco Property No. 2 Partnership in September 2020 and with the PS 585 m of debt acquired with The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership in December 2021. The acquisition of The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership brings into full ownership 11 stores and resulted in a reduction in the lease liability of PS355m. The derecognition of lease liabilities related to these property buybacks and the reducing nature of our total lease liability over time is the primary driver of the PS41m reduction in finance charges payable on lease liabilities year-on-year. Strategic report 27 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 Earnings per share This year Last year Adjusted diluted EPS 21.86p 11.58p Statutory diluted earnings per share 19.64p 5.58p Statutory basic earnings per share 19.86p 5.60p The share base used in Adjusted diluted EPS in the prior year is adjusted to capture the full impact of the share consolidation which followed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, as if it took place at the start of the 2020 21 financial year. Please see page 142 for a reconciliation to Adjusted diluted EPS. Adjusted diluted EPS was 21.86p 2021: 11.58p, 88.8% higher year-on-year as the recovery in retail and Tesco Bank profits, the drivers of which are described more fully in the segmental review of performance section above, more than offset the higher tax charge. Statutory diluted earnings per share was 19.64p 2021: 5.58p 252.0% higher year-on-year. In addition to the recovery in adjusted operating profit, we saw a significant reduction in the net finance charge due to an offsetting credit from fair value remeasurement of financial instruments, the drivers of which are described in the net finance costs section. These benefits more than offset a higher charge related to adjusting items and a higher tax charge in year, driven by higher adjusted operating profit. Discontinued operations We completed the sale of our business in Poland to Salling Group A S in March 2021, generating proceeds of PS122m and a loss on disposal of PS 23 m. Following the sale of Homeplus for PS4.2bn in 2015, we received legal claims from the purchasers. Although the majority of the claims were dismissed, some findings of liability were made. On 17 September 2021, a Final Award to the purchasers of PS119m in damages, interest and costs was granted. An adjusting charge increasing the provision held by PS33m was recognised in the year. The total cash payment of PS119m was made in the second half. Further information on discontinued operations is included in Note 7, starting on page 140. Dividend Last year we held the full-year dividend in line with the 2019 20 financial year to recognise the strong cash generation of the business, despite the significant operating profit impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. This represented an exception to our dividend policy and resulted in a dividend per share which exceeded 50% of adjusted diluted EPS. We propose to pay a final dividend of 7.70 pence per ordinary share, taking the full-year dividend to 10.90 pence per ordinary share, including the payment of an interim dividend of 3.20 pence per ordinary share in November 2021. This year's final dividend is 19.1% higher than last year, reflecting the increase in retail and Tesco Bank adjusted operating profit and the impact from last year's policy exception. It is our intention to pay a progressive dividend going forward - i. e. we aim to grow the dividend per share each year, broadly targeting a pay-out of around 50% of earnings. The proposed final dividend was approved by the Board of Directors on 12 April 2022 and is subject to the approval of shareholders at this year's Annual General Meeting. The final dividend will be paid on 24 June 2022 to shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on 20 May 2022 the record date. Shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividend in the dividend reinvestment plan DRIP. The last date for receipt of DRIP elections and revocations will be 7 June 2022. Summary of total indebtedness excludes Tesco Bank Feb-22 Feb-21 Movement Net debt before lease liabilities PS 2,570 m PS 3,449 m PS879m Lease liabilities PS 7,946 m PS 8,506 m PS560m Net debt PS 10,516 m PS 11,955 m PS1,439m Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax PS 242 m PS 1,004 m PS762m Total indebtedness PS 10,758 m PS 12,959 m PS2,201m Net debt EBITDA 2.5x 3.3x Total indebtedness ratio 2.5x 3.6x Total indebtedness was PS 10,758 m, down PS2,201m year-on-year primarily driven by strong free cash flow generation leading to a reduction in net debt, net of dividends paid and a PS762m reduction in the IAS 19 pension deficit. Lease liabilities were PS 7,946 m, down PS560m year-on-year largely due to the derecognition of PS355m relating to the 11 stores we took back into full ownership following the purchase of our partner's stake in The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership. We also derecognised PS120m of lease liabilities relating to our Polish business following the sale of the business to Salling Group A S in March 2021. The acquisition of our partner's stake in The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership increased net debt by c. PS 300 m, including PS 585 m of borrowings acquired and PS 64 m of derivatives, net of a reduction in the related lease liabilities. Pension liabilities significantly decreased during the year, primarily due to an increase in discount rates driven by higher corporate bond yields, partially offset by underlying market movements in inflation rates and gilts. The pension assets increased year-on-year due to strong investment returns. As a result, we carried a net IAS 19 pension surplus post-tax at the end of the year of PS2,121m, compared to a net deficit of PS 1,004 m last year. The Group IAS 19 pension surplus is disregarded in total indebtedness and only pension schemes which are in a net deficit position are considered. We had strong levels of liquidity at the end of the year of PS3.0bn and our PS2.5bn committed facility remained undrawn. Our committed facility currently matures in September 2024 and we have the option to extend this by a further year. The rate of interest payable on this facility is linked to three of our sustainability commitments. As we delivered these sustainability targets, we achieved the corresponding margin reduction in the year. In October, we issued our second  bond, raising PS400m at a low rate of interest. This was issued to refinance a bond which was approaching maturity and the refinancing will result in an annual interest saving of PS18m. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.5 times, down from 3.3 times at the prior year end and within our targeted range of 2.8 to 2.3 times. The year-on-year improvement represents both an increase in our retail EBITDA due to higher sales and lower COVID-19 costs, and a reduction in net debt before lease liabilities driven by strong free cash flow generation. The total indebtedness ratio was 2.5 times compared to 3.6 times last year. Fixed charge cover was 3.5 times this year, compared to 2.9 times last year, reflecting a reduction in net finance costs, lease interest payments, lease principal payments and higher retail EBITDA. Financial review continued 28 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 Summary retail cash flow Our retail free cash flow APM definition was updated at the interim results this year to provide a better view of operational cash performance and excludes cashflows related to acquisitions and disposals, property transactions and adjusting cash items. We continue to fully disclose these lines but they do not form part of the retail free cash flow headline APM. The following table reconciles Group adjusted operating profit to retail free cash flow. Further details are included on page 211. This year Last year Adjusted operating profit PS2,825m PS1,788m Less: Tesco Bank adjusted operating profit loss PS 176 m PS175m Retail adjusted operating profit PS2,649m PS1,963m Add back: Depreciation and amortisation PS1,577m PS1,611m Other reconciling items PS61m PS4m Pension deficit contribution PS 19 m PS 351 m Decrease in working capital PS501m PS450m Retail cash generated from operations before adjusting items PS4,769m PS3,677m Cash capex PS 1,050 m PS 902 m Net interest PS 641 m PS 670 m - Interest related to Net debt exc. lease liabilities PS 239 m PS 226 m - Interest related to lease liabilities PS 402 m PS 444 m Tax paid PS 195 m PS 161 m Dividends received PS109m PS23m Repayments of obligations under leases PS 571 m PS 561 m Own shares purchased for share schemes PS 144 m PS 66 m Retail free cash flow PS2,277m PS1,340m Memo: Acquisitions & disposals PS122m PS 2 m Property proceeds & purchases PS228m PS 110 m Cash impact of adjusting items PS 316 m PS 41 m Retail free cash flow increased by PS937m year-on-year to PS2,277m, driven by higher retail adjusted operating profit, a reduction in the pension contribution, a benefit from lower working capital and an increase in the dividend received from Tesco Bank following its return to profitability this year. Following a PS2.5bn one-off contribution towards the pension deficit in the prior year, using the proceeds from the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, UK pension contributions were eliminated. We expect an annual benefit of c. PS260m in retail free cash flow as a result of lower pension deficit contributions. The pension cash outflow of PS 19 m in the year mainly relates to Booker pension scheme. Our total working capital inflow was PS501m, driven by the sharp recovery in fuel volumes and Booker's catering business in the first half as travel and hospitality sector restrictions were significantly fewer than at the end of the prior year. In the second half, working capital was broadly neutral, as the seasonal unwind we would normally see following peak trading over the summer was offset by strong UK sales and higher fuel payables due to both higher volumes and cost price inflation. Cash capex increased by PS 148 m year-on-year as we opened more stores in the UK than in the prior year as a result of COVID-19 and continued to expand our online proposition across the UK & ROI businesses. Interest paid related to net debt exc. lease liabilities of PS 239 m was PS 13 m higher year-on-year. The benefit of bond buybacks and refinancing at lower rates of interest was more than offset by the impact of borrowings acquired as part of The Tesco Property No. 2 Limited Partnership from September 2020 and The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership from December 2021. Interest paid related to lease liabilities decreased by PS42m year-on-year primarily due to a reduction in the total lease liability following the derecognition of the liabilities related to these properties. Cash tax paid in the year was PS 195 m, compared to PS 161 m last year. The increase reflects higher retail adjusted operating profits year-on-year, which was partially offset by prior-year tax losses and a benefit from the super-deduction allowance on certain capital investments, which was introduced in the Chancellor's budget in March 2021. We also continue to receive tax relief in relation to the PS2.5bn one-off pension contribution made in the prior year. This amounted to PS120m for the full year. We saw a net cash outflow of PS 144 m related to the purchase of our own shares, which includes PS 191 m of shares purchased in the market to offset the dilution from the issuance of new shares to satisfy the requirements of share schemes and a PS47m cash inflow related to proceeds from colleague share saving schemes. The net impact was PS 78 m higher than the prior year, driven by the phasing of purchases to satisfy current year maturities. This will lead to a significant reduction in the net spend in the current year. Cash flows related to acquisitions and disposals, property transactions and adjusting cash items are now excluded from our simplified definition of retail free cash flow. The inflow from disposals in the year of PS122m includes the proceeds from the sale of our business in Poland to Salling Group A S, which completed in March 2021. We generated a net PS228m from property transactions, which includes PS308m generated from the sale of properties, net of an outflow of PS 80 m related to property buybacks. We disposed of our Fenny Lock distribution centre in the second half for proceeds of PS146m and generated PS109m from the sale of properties in Poland which were not included in the corporate transaction with Salling Group A S. We bought back one Extra store in Bury for PS 37 m and paid cash consideration of PS 43 m to buy back a full stake in The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership. The cash impact of adjusting items was PS 316 m, of which PS 312 m related to the settlement of shareholder litigation claims and a legal claim from the purchasers of our Homeplus business during the period.

Supplementary information page 205 provides a full breakdown of space by segment. Capital expenditure capex shown in the table above reflects expenditure on ongoing business activities across the Group, excluding property buybacks. Our capital expenditure for the year was PS1,101m, PS86m higher year-on-year, which primarily relates to the ongoing investment in our online proposition, and the opening of new Tesco Express and One Stop stores in the UK. We opened a further three UFCs in the UK and rolled out more delivery vans and an additional 37 Click & Collect sites in ROI. We also purchased an additional 20 electric delivery vans and two electric HGVs in the UK as we continue to work to reduce emissions from our own operations. We opened two superstores in the UK, with sites in Mablethorpe and Wolverhampton, and a further 21 Tesco Express sites, which was slightly fewer than expected. We expect to open 65 Tesco Express stores in the current year. We expect 2022 23 full year capital expenditure to be at the top end of our PS0.9bn to PS1.2bn guidance range. Statutory capital expenditure of PS1.8bn includes PS0.6bn relating to the buyback of one UK Extra store in Bury and The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership property joint venture referred to above.

The estimated market value of our fully owned property as at the year end increased by PS0.2bn to PS18.1bn. The market value of PS18.1bn represents a surplus of PS1.6bn over the net book value. Our Group freehold property ownership percentage, by value was in line with the prior year at 58%. In December, we completed the purchase of our partner's 50% stake in The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership, bringing back into full ownership seven sites. This acquisition contributed to a 1% increase in the percentage of fully owned properties in the UK & ROI and will deliver an annual cash rental saving of c. PS30m. We also repurchased one Extra store in the UK. In Central Europe, the reduction in the market value of fully owned property year-on-year reflects the reclassification of a number of mall properties which are held for sale. In the year, we released PS109m of proceeds through the disposal of properties in Poland which were not included as part of the corporate sale. 30 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022",

Additionally, while retail profits declined due to COVID-19 costs, strong operational resilience and improved sales during the year support some persistence. However, the full return to pre-pandemic profitability levels is forecasted, suggesting some temporary distortion in the current year's ROE.\n\n# Forecasts:\n- Expected **ROE** for next year is likely to moderate but remain significantly above prior years, as Tesco anticipates retail operating profit recovery to pre-COVID levels and expects Tesco Bank to return to profitability, supporting sustainable **ROE** growth.\n\n# Summary:\n- Tesco's **ROE** has surged from **7.3%** to nearly **50%**, reflecting improved profitability and efficient equity use, partly boosted by significant asset sales and pension scheme contributions.  \n- The increase reflects a mix of operational strength and one-off financial events, with management expecting profit and cash flow recovery, indicating potential sustainability but also some temporary elements.  \n- Key risks include uncertainty from COVID-19, Brexit impacts, and Tesco Bank's recovery, but Tesco's strategic focus on growth, cost control, and capital discipline supports medium-term **ROE** improvement.",
        "Detailed Analysis of ROE Drivers": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?**  \n  The growth in ROE is driven by increases in both **Assets Turnover** and **Profit Margin**. The **Assets Turnover** improved from **5.03** to **5.67**, while the **Profit Margin** increased significantly from **1.5%** to **10.6%**. This simultaneous improvement in both efficiency and profitability is a very positive indicator of strong operational performance.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  While the textual report does not provide explicit competitor or industry benchmarks, Tesco's strong operational metrics such as a **7.1% increase in Group sales**, a leap in **online sales by 77%**, and improved **customer net promoter scores** indicate market leadership and operational efficiency. The significant jump in **Profit Margin** further suggests Tesco is outperforming typical retail margins, which tend to be slim, signaling a competitive advantage.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year:** Given the positive trend and ongoing strategic investments in online capacity and store efficiency, **Asset Turnover** is expected to maintain or slightly improve, forecasted around **5.7 to 5.8**.  \n- **Expected Profit Margin next year:** With anticipated recovery post-COVID costs and continued focus on value and cost control, **Profit Margin** is forecasted to stabilize or improve moderately, expected around **11% to 12%**.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The company shows a strong **ROE growth driven by both improved Asset Turnover and Profit Margin**, reflecting enhanced operational efficiency and profitability.  \n- **Profit Margin improvement is particularly notable**, increasing over sevenfold, which is significant in the retail sector, indicating strong cost management and pricing strategy.  \n- Continued strategic focus on online growth and store efficiency, as detailed in the report, supports positive **Forecasts** for both key drivers, with an outlook of sustained or improving performance.",

The business was started in 1919 by Jack Cohen, selling surplus groceries from a stall in the East End of London. In 1929, the first Tesco store opened in Edgware, North London. Today, we have stores in five countries across Europe: the UK, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. As a leading retailer, with more than 360,000 colleagues, Tesco serves many millions of customers every week, in stores and online. Tesco completed a merger with Booker Group, the UK's leading food wholesaler, helping to create substantial synergies and access to the 'out-of-home' food market. The Tesco Group also includes Tesco Bank, which provides banking, insurance and money services: Tesco Mobile, the UK's largest mobile virtual network operator: and dunnhumby, a wholly-owned data science subsidiary. Our business is guided by the shared purpose of serving shoppers a little better every day, underpinned by three values: no one tries harder for customers: we treat people how they want to be treated: every little help makes a big difference. At Tesco, serving shoppers means more than selling food. It means acting as a responsible and sustainable business for all our stakeholders -- customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders -- and providing affordable, healthy and sustainable food for all. 4 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Building a stronger business through a difficult year. Chairman's statement Reflecting on this year, I believe it has been among the most challenging that Tesco has faced in its 101-year history. The COVID-19 pandemic brought disruption and uncertainty to our business and to all our customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders. In responding to these challenges, we were guided by our values as a business and stayed true to our purpose of serving shoppers a little better every day. COVID-19 Our response to COVID-19 has consistently focused on ensuring our customers and colleagues could shop and work safely at Tesco. This year, we reflect on the serious challenges and uncertainty our business and our colleagues have faced. We pay tribute to every colleague affected and our thoughts are with those who have lost friends and loved ones. It has been hugely difficult, but every person at Tesco rose to the challenge and went above and beyond to help each other and those in their communities. The Board continuously provided guidance and support to help our teams do the right thing, and I am very proud of the role everybody at Tesco has played during the pandemic. In March 2020, the Government granted all UK retail and hospitality businesses 12 months of business rates relief. At the time, this relief was essential to navigate the uncertainty and significant costs associated with responding to COVID-19. Towards the end of 2020, we had greater clarity on the situation and we took the decision as a Board to repay business rates relief to the Government, so that it could support businesses that needed it more. We firmly believe it was the right thing to do and is consistent with our purpose and values as a business. Business performance The business has shown incredible resilience and agility in the year, with Group sales increasing 7.1% at actual rates. While the costs of responding to the pandemic have been significant, we have strengthened our relationship with customers and built a stronger business for our shareholders. Customer perception of the brand has improved and we had a record year for online, an area where we see great potential for the future. In preparation for Brexit, we worked very hard alongside all suppliers to ensure there would be minimal disruption to our customers. There have been many challenges and we will continue to navigate the changes into the next year but overall, we have maintained strong availability for all our customers in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and across Central Europe. We also completed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia. This has unlocked significant value and allowed us to further simplify and focus the Group. We returned PS5bn of the proceeds to shareholders through a special dividend in February 2021 and made a one-off contribution of PS2.5bn to our pension scheme. This contribution has greatly reduced the prospect of having to make further pension deficit contributions in the future. After the year end, we also completed the sale of our business in Poland to Salling Group. Board changes In October 2020, our former Group Chief Executive, Sir Dave Lewis left the business and handed over to Ken Murphy. Sir Dave guided the business through the challenging turnaround and was unwavering in his commitment to Tesco for over six years. We thank him for his outstanding service. I'm delighted that Ken Murphy has joined the Board as Group Chief Executive. Ken has hit the ground running, leading the business in its response to the ongoing pandemic and delivering a resilient full-year performance. At the end of April, Alan Stewart will retire and we will welcome Imran Nawaz to the Board as Chief Financial Officer. Alan has made an impressive and sustained contribution to Tesco's turnaround, both as CFO and as a Board member. We wish him all the best in his retirement. We recently announced that Deanna Oppenheimer, Mark Armour and Mikael Olsson will retire at this year's AGM. We thank each of them for their invaluable contribution and counsel over many years. Deanna will also step down from her role as Senior Independent Director, to be replaced by Byron Grote. Looking forward, we will welcome Karen Whitworth, Bertrand Bodson and Thierry Garnier to the Board as Non-executive Directors. Thierry will join the Remuneration Committee, Karen will join the Audit Committee and both Bertrand and Karen will join the Corporate Responsibility Committee. They bring with them a broad range of skills and experience and we look forward to benefiting from their valuable perspectives. Looking ahead In the coming months, we will continue to manage the impact of COVID-19 and Brexit, thanks in no small part to the hard work of our colleagues and our great relationships with suppliers. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank everyone at Tesco for going the extra mile this year to build a stronger business and serve shoppers a little better every day. John Allan CBE Non-executive Chairman 13 April 2021 5 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Group Chief Executive's review I am so pleased to be writing my first Annual Report statement as Tesco CEO. Throughout my career across retail and wholesale, I have always admired Tesco. It is a business that truly puts customers first and pushes the boundaries of retail, by following a simple purpose of serving shoppers a little better every day. Since joining the business, I have focused on our response to the immediate challenges of COVID-19 and serving customers through the end of the UK-EU transition period. I have also had the opportunity to meet some of our fantastic colleagues, customers, suppliers, shareholders and other stakeholders, coming to understand the business from the inside and building relationships. I have three initial impressions from my first six months: 1. Throughout the pandemic, colleagues have shown incredible resilience, responding with urgency and compassion to ensure our customers and colleagues stayed safe. Tesco is a business full of people who truly care about what they do. The warmth and passion from people across the business has been inspiring. Tesco is more than a supermarket to our customers. The role we play in our communities and in wider society is essential to maintaining trust and loyalty among those who shop with us. COVID-19 The pandemic has brought challenges to every part of our business, but on a personal level, it has also tested the resilience of our people. We asked our colleagues to step up and be key workers and, putting personal concerns to one side, everyone worked harder than ever in order to serve customers safely. I am incredibly proud of the way colleagues across Tesco have responded, showing a combination of skilful retailing with a sense of purpose and compassion and always putting our customers and communities first. As a business, our approach has been based on four priorities: to provide food for all: safety for everyone: support for colleagues: and support for communities. Food for all Recognising that many of our vulnerable customers were unable to shop in stores, we focused on growing our online business. We increased online capacity in every market, and in the UK we now offer 1.5 million weekly online slots and priority access to more than 850,000 vulnerable customers. Booker's role was invaluable, supporting care homes and providing 100,000 new Click & Collect slots for Tesco customers. In addition, we worked in partnership with our suppliers to maintain availability for our customers across the UK, Ireland and Central Europe and ensured our smallest suppliers were paid immediately. Our teamwork was recognised by suppliers, who named Tesco as the number one retailer for collaboration during a crisis in the 2020 independent Supplier Advantage survey. Safety for everyone It is essential to us that Tesco is a safe place to shop and work and I'm pleased that 90% of UK customers felt safe shopping in our stores, with ratings even higher in Central Europe. We have made significant investments in safety and social distancing measures across every one of our stores in the UK, Ireland and Central Europe, so that people can continue to shop with confidence. In the UK, we created one of the first safety adverts from a food retailer to clearly communicate our new measures with customers. These include limits on the number of customers in store, social distancing signage, sanitising stations, protective screening at checkouts, and face coverings and other protective equipment for colleagues. Support for colleagues We have more than 360,000 colleagues across the Group and they have consistently shown dedication, despite any personal challenges they have faced due to the pandemic. Everyone's circumstances are different but we ensured our most vulnerable colleagues remained at home on full pay when government guidance advised that they should shield. To cover absences and to help meet increased demand, we recruited around 50,000 additional temporary colleagues to ensure there was enough support. Throughout the year, we recognised the contribution of our frontline colleagues, with three separate bonuses. It has also been important to recognise the mental health challenges of this year too, and we made the apps Headspace and SilverCloud available as free support tools to UK colleagues, with similar support tools in all markets. Support for communities We have always done what we can to help our local communities but this year was exceptional. In 2020, we donated more than PS60m worth of meals to UK foodbanks and charities helping those in need in our communities and supporting our partners, FareShare and the Trussell Trust. In Ireland, Tesco donated nearly EU1m in COVID-19 support to local causes nationwide, and in Central Europe, we made our largest ever food donation to food banks in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Tesco Bank increased contactless payment limits, reduced overdraft fees, introduced e-gift cards and offered loan and credit card payment breaks to customers that needed it. Tesco Mobile helped disadvantaged children with their home schooling by offering an extra 20GB of data a month through schools. A year of challenges, leadership and teamwork. 6 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Our business and team As the Chairman reflected in his statement, we have navigated new regulations as a result of Brexit and successfully minimised any disruption for our customers. This is thanks to extensive preparations and contingency planning by our team and a strong partnership with our suppliers. We will continue to prioritise our customers as the situation develops but our business remains agile and resilient to the challenges. In December 2020, we completed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia to CP Group and in March 2021, we completed the sale of our business in Poland to Salling Group. These have been longstanding businesses within the Tesco Group and I am grateful to all the teams for their dedication in serving Tesco customers. Looking forward, I am confident that we have strong positions and opportunities to create value in our markets in the UK, Republic of Ireland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Following the sale of our Asia business, we shared with colleagues the news that Alison Horner has decided to leave Tesco after 22 years with the business. Alison has had a long and successful career at Tesco and we wish her all the best in the future. This year, we also said goodbye to Charles Wilson. Charles joined Tesco in 2018, following the merger with Booker. He is an exceptionally skilled retailer and has managed the 'Joining Forces' of Tesco and Booker seamlessly. We thank him for all he has done, helping to create the UK's leading food business. At the end of April, Alan Stewart will retire as CFO after nearly seven years with Tesco and we will welcome Imran Nawaz to the team. Alan was integral to the turnaround strategy and rebuilding the balance sheet. In his last year, he did not slow down. He launched the first  bond by a retailer globally, reaffirming the Group's commitment to be a net-zero carbon business in the UK by 2035, as well as playing a key role in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals CFO network. I very much look forward to working alongside Imran to build on this fantastic work. As well as Imran, we welcomed Ashwin Prasad to the Executive Committee as Chief Product Officer. Ashwin replaced Andrew Yaxley who has taken on the role of Booker CEO since Charles' retirement. After nearly three years as Group Chief Operating Officer, we are delighted that Tony Hoggett has taken up the new role of Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer for Tesco Group and will develop, mobilise and lead our strategic ambitions aligned to Group-wide goals. Looking forward Tesco is more than a supermarket to our customers. As a business, we have both the scale and the passion to make sure we benefit all those around us. Alongside our Annual Report, we are publishing our Little Helps Plan, which captures our approach to being a responsible and therefore sustainable business. This year, we have made further progress and commitments on tackling carbon emissions, reducing food waste, driving down plastic consumption and supporting a healthier lifestyle for our customers. These topics are important to our customers and colleagues but they are also essential for the long-term sustainability of our business. Despite the challenges we have faced this year, I am confident that the business is in a strong place. Our colleagues remain focused on serving shoppers a little better every day and we continue to make the right decisions for customers, communities and the planet to set us up for success in the future. By looking after our customers, and building on the strong foundations we have created through the pandemic, we will in turn continue to create value for shareholders. Ken Murphy Group Chief Executive 13 April 2021 Colleague hero -- Seema Ishmail Seema Ishmail from our Bury Superstore was nominated for a Retail Week Frontline Hero award for her fantastic community support. At the start of lockdown, Seema shopped for some of our most vulnerable customers who were unable to visit the store themselves. She then started working with charities and care homes to ensure everyone got the food they needed. Seema organised everything herself, contacting charities, segregating stock and organising collections. She has worked tirelessly and become a true hero to her local community. 7 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Our business model Serving shoppers better.

Our sustainability strategy, the Little Helps Plan, ensures we do this in a way that's good for our colleagues, our customers, communities and the planet too. Our values No one tries harder for customers We treat people how they want to be treated Every little help makes a big difference Code of Business Conduct Our Code of Business Conduct is at the heart of how we run our business and helps protect our reputation. It ensures we operate in a responsible manner, doing the right thing for our customers, our colleagues and everybody we interact with. We want to make a big difference. Our presence in thousands of communities, employing hundreds of thousands of people directly and indirectly through our supply chain, and interaction with millions of shoppers every day, gives us unique opportunities to bring about change for the better. This has never been more important as we recover from the global COVID-19 pandemic. At the start of this year, in the face of the pandemic, we prioritised safety, ensuring customers had access to the food they needed, supporting our colleagues and helping the wider community. The Little Helps Plan, through its focus on People, Product, Planet and Places, gave us a clear framework to respond to COVID-19. Our existing partnerships with organisations such as FareShare, the Trussell Trust and the British Red Cross meant we had good foundations in place to support local communities. Our commitments to giving our colleagues the support they need to be at their physical and mental best also ensured we had programmes in place to make a difference. We believe the decisions and actions we have taken this year demonstrate our commitment to a more sustainable future - one in which everyone is made to feel safe and welcome and has access to healthy, sustainable food at an affordable price. 2020 was a milestone year for us, during which we were due to deliver many of our goals, including those on climate action, healthy diets and packaging. Despite the unprecedented challenge posed by the pandemic, we successfully achieved all these goals. People Employment and skills Diversity and inclusion Health, safety and wellbeing Human rights Product Food waste Packaging Healthy sustainable diets Animal welfare Planet Climate change Sustainable agriculture Marine Tackling deforestation Places Supporting communities Food redistribution You can find a full review of our activity, performance and future ambitions in our Little Helps Plan report and at www. We reduced our absolute carbon emissions by over 50%, removed over 50 billion calories through reformulation and permanently eliminated 1 billion pieces of plastic. We were also recognised by numerous external benchmarks. These included the highest ranking of any food retailer in the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark and Oxfam Behind the Barcodes, marking how we continue to lead the way on important human rights issues such as gender equality and sustainable livelihoods. 12 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 COVID-19 support We are proud of our more than 360,000 colleagues who have worked relentlessly throughout the pandemic in service of feeding the nation. Their health, safety and wellbeing have been and continue to be a top priority for us. Alongside the physical safety measures we have taken, we have also stepped up our mental wellbeing support that is helping our colleagues and their families manage COVID-19's impact on everybody's daily lives. In April 2020, we launched two new free digital mental health resources, Headspace and SilverCloud, to colleagues, with almost 30,000 of them making use of Headspace since launch. During Mental Health Awareness Week in May 2020, we launched our first mental health colleague campaign #imhereforyou. This encourages colleagues to reach out to each other and remind everyone that no one is ever alone at Tesco. We followed this campaign with more specific guidance for colleagues working at home. Our colleague-listening programme, Every Voice Matters, helps us gather feedback and implement improvements throughout the year. More than two-thirds of colleagues across the Group took part in our annual survey, and 82% of them told us they think Tesco is a great place to work. Supporting job creation and skills development During the first UK lockdown, we hired nearly 50,000 temporary colleagues to help serve customers when demand was at its highest. Many of these colleagues continue to work with us in newly created roles, including the 20,000 permanent jobs we created to meet increased demand for online deliveries. By investing in young people, we hope to provide many with the opportunity to enter the world of work and build skills at a time when labour markets are tough. For example, we pledged support to the UK Government's Kickstart scheme, offering 1,000 placements. In November we welcomed 900 Kickstart colleagues to our large stores in areas of high youth unemployment across the UK, with the aim of helping them be 'work-ready' at the end of their placement. We also continued to offer work placements to young people not in education, employment or training NEETs through the Movement to Work programme. In the UK, 618 placements took place during the year, with 344 becoming colleagues. Diversity and inclusion We value individuality and uniqueness, and treat everyone fairly and with respect. You can find more information on our approach to diversity and inclusion on page 17. Protecting human rights We are committed to ensuring there is decent, fair, safe work for all, both directly and indirectly throughout our supply chain. Our human rights strategy focuses on four priority areas: sustainable livelihoods: forced labour: worker representation: and gender equality. We have identified risk areas within our own operations and across our supply chain. We work with suppliers, NGOs and other retailers to develop targets and action plans that address the risks. COVID-19 has impacted our ability to undertake physical site visits and audits, however we have continued to support our suppliers and safeguard workers' rights in our supply chain with webinars and virtual due diligence assessments to ensure continued supply chain visibility. Clothing suppliers have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic. From the start of the crisis, we committed to paying for every clothing order that had been completed or was in production. We focused on ensuring garment workers were paid correctly and that health and safety measures and personal protective equipment were in place for workers. As part of our sustainable livelihoods strategy, we started working with our banana suppliers in August, using the IDH Salary Matrix tool to identify gaps between prevailing wages and living wages in key sourcing countries of one of our best selling products. We will be working with producers and the wider industry from 2021 to develop strategies and actions to move towards a living wage in the banana industry. People are at the heart of our business and this has been an incredibly tough year for everyone. Our colleagues went above and beyond, rising to every challenge in the most exceptional circumstances. People We are committed to supporting our clinically extremely vulnerable and high-risk clinically vulnerable colleagues and have ensured they remained at home on full pay during peak lockdown moments following government guidance. For colleagues who became ill with COVID-19 or needed to self-isolate, we ensured they received full pay from the first day of absence. We have also paid recognition bonuses totalling around PS130m, to colleagues across the Group for their hard work throughout the pandemic. 13 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Little Helps Plan continued Product We believe that healthy, sustainable products should be affordable to all. In our Product pillar, we take action to ensure that products are grown, sourced and produced in a sustainable way, embracing new technologies and innovation. Healthy, sustainable food We want to help our customers enjoy a better-balanced diet, and we aim to make the healthy option easy, enjoyable and affordable. That's why we updated our health strategy this year to be better aligned to the UK Eatwell Guide. We aim to improve the healthiness of the average shopping basket by increasing the proportion of healthy products to 65% of volume sold by 2025. We became the first UK supermarket to commit to increasing the sales of plant-based meat alternatives by 300% by 2025. We already have over 350 plant-based meat alternatives on our shelves and we continue to invest in innovation with new plantbased brands joining our incubator programme this year. Alongside our growth in plant-based foods, we have also continued to help our customers eat more fruit and vegetables, with 50% of our ready meals now containing at least one of the recommended 5-a-day, up from 26% in 2018. Through reformulation, we have made thousands of the products our customers enjoy a little healthier by reducing calories, fat, sugar and salt and increasing fruit, vegetable and fibre content. Since 2018, we have removed over 50 billion calories. We are working hard to remove a further 50 billion by 2024. Packaging Packaging plays an important role in protecting products and reducing food waste. Our 4Rs strategy Remove, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle aims to ensure that plastic never finds its way to landfill or into the environment. In December 2020, we announced the permanent removal of 1 billion pieces of plastic from the UK business. Working with our suppliers, we successfully removed plastic from a range of products, including 67 million pieces on tinned multipacks and 24 million pieces on our sausage rolls and slices packaging. By volume, 84% a of our Own Brand packaging is widely recyclable. We are working with partners to address the more challenging soft plastic, installing in-store recycling points to collect plastic from products including bread, crisp and salad bags. Working with reusable packaging specialists Loop, in July we launched an online shopping service that delivers products in reusable packaging. Since the launch we have delivered thousands of orders to customers across the UK, and we are aiming to trial in-store in 2021. Tackling food waste Our fight against food waste calls for action on farms and manufacturing sites, in-store and at home. This year we prevented a higher percentage of good food going to waste than ever before, with 82% of unsold food being given to charities, colleagues or as animal feed in the UK. We were able to do this through our partnership with FareShare, via more than 6,500 local community groups and through the Olio app, which is now redistributing 3% of our unsold food suitable for human consumption. Across the Group, we have reduced food waste by 42% since 2016 17 and are making good progress towards our ambition of halving food waste by 2030. Our suppliers have also stepped up to the food waste challenge, cutting 155,000 tonnes of food waste: 71 suppliers are now publishing their food waste data, including those responsible for over half of fresh food sales in the UK and a third of fresh food sales in Ireland. a In accordance with the producer responsibility obligations we report our recycling performance a year in arrears. KPMG LLP was engaged to provide independent limited assurance over the selected food waste data highlighted in this report with a using the assurance standard ISAE UK 3000. KPMG has issued an unqualified opinion over the selected data. KPMG's full assurance statement is available at: www. com reportinghub Ambitious health commitments In March 2021, we announced new targets to make Tesco the easiest place for customers to shop for affordable, healthy, sustainable food: - increase the proportion of sales of healthy food to 65% by 2025: - make products healthier through reformulation: and - increase the sales of plant-based meat alternatives by 300% by 2025. Further information is available in our Little Helps Plan report. 14 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Planet The health and stability of the natural world goes hand-in-hand with the health and stability of our business - they are two sides of the same coin. As we strive to provide our customers with affordable, healthy, sustainable food, we are also taking action on important issues including climate change and restoring nature. Climate change Climate change is the biggest environmental threat the world faces, and one that poses a challenge to our business and our supply chains. Recognising this, climate change has now been included as a separate principal risk, as set out on pages 33 to 37. We impact the climate in our own operations and through our supply chains, and we have a longstanding commitment to reduce carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. We are also implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD, details of which are set out on pages 26 to 28. In 2020 we committed to fast-track our net zero ambitions for the UK business to 2035, announcing new actions to help tackle our biggest sources of emissions: refrigeration, transport and heating. Actions include switching to CO 2 in refrigeration and trialling alternative heating solutions like heat reclaim. 100% of our electricity is renewable and we are creating additional renewable energy generation for the UK National Grid. One of our projects includes partnering with renewable energy investor, Low Carbon, to create three new solar farms in the UK. In September we became signatories to EV100, the global initiative focused on accelerating the transition to electric vehicles and aim to have a fully electric home delivery fleet by 2028. Despite the unprecedented challenge presented by COVID-19 and the subsequent changes to our operations, most notably the growth in online shopping, our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas GHG emissions across the Group reduced by 10% compared to 2019 20, and by 54% when compared to our 2015 baseline. Halving the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket In 2018, we launched a four-year partnership with WWF, aimed at making it easier for customers to eat more sustainably, restore nature in food production and eliminate waste. In 2019, we jointly launched the Sustainable Basket Metric, a pioneering industry measurement for monitoring progress against the ambition of halving the environmental impact of the average basket. This year, we established our baseline 2018 performance using the 20 sub-metrics contained within the Sustainable Basket Metric, calculating that we are 11% of the way towards our target. We have made progress in many of the areas covered by the Basket Metric, including improvements in tackling food and packaging waste, and encouraging plant-based diets with our commitment to increasing the sales of plant-based meat alternatives by 300% by 2025. ft. of stores and DCs 16.76 22.88 26.53 38.96 a We engaged KPMG LLP to provide independent limited assurance over the greenhouse gas emissions data highlighted in the above table with a using the assurance standards ISAE UK 3000 and 3410. All figures have been restated to reflect the disposal of Thailand, Malaysia and Poland and include the acquisition of Best Food Logistics in the UK as well as minor data improvements. b Our method statement can be accessed at www. We use the market-based method for calculating Scope 2 emissions for our total emissions to account for our efforts in generating and purchasing low-carbon energy. The location-based method is provided for disclosure only and all intensity, net and gross emissions shown are calculated using Scope 2 market-based method. c Under Scope 3 emissions we report business travel and emissions from distribution arranged by Tesco but provided by third parties including secondary distribution globally and emissions from primary distribution in the UK. Scope 3 emissions also include transmission and distribution impacts of electricity and heat supply and well-to-tank embodied impacts of fuel. Further information on our carbon calculations is available at www. Tackling deforestation Preventing deforestation and degradation is critical to a sustainable future. In 2010, we committed to achieving zero net deforestation of our raw materials by 2020. We achieved this goal through certification and have since introduced further targets within our zero deforestation soy transition plan. These include our aim of sourcing 100% of our soy from verified zerodeforestation areas by 2025. 15 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Places Many families are facing hardship due to the pandemic. In April we announced a PS30m package of support for communities in the UK dealing with COVID-19. Building on our five-year partnership with FareShare and the Trussell Trust, we donated an additional PS15m worth of food to community groups and food banks, additional to the estimated PS3m worth of food we donate each month by redistributing surplus food. In total during the year, we provided nearly 29 million meals from stores and distribution centres to charity groups in the UK and 17 million meals in Central Europe. We were also proud to partner with SalutetheNHS. org, donating all the food in a million food parcels for frontline NHS workers. Our customers have also made a massive contribution to communities through our Food Collection events and in-store collection points. In the UK, a total of more than 1.3 million meals were donated this year and in Central Europe 1,000 tonnes of food was donated or collected for food banks in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. We are a member of the Marcus Rashford Child Poverty Task Force, which is campaigning for solutions to end child food poverty in the UK. From November 2020 to March 2021, families who used the weekly Healthy Start Vouchers received a PS1 coupon to spend on fresh and frozen fruit and vegetables at Tesco. We also awarded nearly PS8m of Bags of Help grants during 2020, benefiting more than 10,000 community groups across the UK. In Ireland we supported more than 1,700 good causes through the Community Fund. In Central Europe, we helped 683 local groups with You Choose, We Help grants. Supporting our communities has never been more vital than during the past year, when the ongoing pandemic has affected the lives of so many people. By working with our partners, we are helping thousands of communities. Through our charity partnerships, community grant programmes and colleague and customer fundraising we have donated PS129m this year. Supporting our health charity partners The Health Charity Partnership between Tesco, Cancer Research UK, the British Heart Foundation and Diabetes UK helps people in the UK make sustainable lifestyle changes and adopt healthy habits. Since 2017, we have raised over PS17m for our health charity partners. During the pandemic, our partners faced record levels of demand for their services at the moment their funding was significantly impacted by the cancellation of fundraising events and temporary closure of shops. To support our partners, we held a fundraising appeal across all our UK stores in September 2020. Customers were able to support the appeal by rounding up their shop to the nearest PS1. Over the 13-day in-store appeal, customer donations totalled nearly PS1.5m. Tesco matched contributions to bring the total charity donation to PS3m. Little Helps Plan continued 16 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Diversity and inclusion Diversity and inclusion at Tesco. Everyone's welcome at Tesco Diversity and inclusion have always been at the heart of Tesco. It is embedded in our values: we treat people how they want to be treated. We always want our colleagues to feel they can be themselves at work. We are committed to helping everyone be at their best by creating a sense of belonging and valuing the individuality and uniqueness of our colleagues. Tesco's diversity and inclusion strategy Across the business we will continue to work to create a more diverse and inclusive culture. This will in turn improve performance, better reflect the communities we serve, and enhance engagement among our colleagues, customers and suppliers. Our strategy is underpinned by five colleague networks, who support in the creation of a diverse and inclusive culture where everyone is welcome. The networks being: LGBTQ : Women at Tesco: Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic Network: Armed Forces Network: and Disability Network. Our strategy is formed of three key pillars and related priorities: Becoming data rich Our 'This is Me' campaign asks all colleagues to voluntarily share their diversity data. This will help us better understand the diversity of our workforce, make more informed and inclusive decisions and put plans in place where they are needed most. This data insight will allow us to hold ourselves accountable for progress and track the success of interventions, as well as enabling us to participate in future legislative and voluntary reporting. Inclusive leadership We have defined what inclusive leadership means at Tesco and measure as part of our leaders' performance. We have also developed a series of masterclasses for all Tesco senior leaders. Focusing on bias, race equality and privilege, these are supported by self-led resources to help further build inclusive behaviours across our business. Mentoring In partnership with Arrival Education, our Executive Committee participated in a mentoring programme to support young, diverse talent outside our business. This gave them the inspiration, insight and skills to drive meaningful change in developing socially and ethnically diverse talent within Tesco. We will extend this programme to our business leaders in 2021. Diverse talent development As part of our talent planning processes, we ensure equal opportunities for all colleagues. To help us support young talent more effectively, we have introduced Diverse Talent Communities which are sponsored by our Executive team. Initially, these communities will focus on helping colleagues from minority ethnic backgrounds accelerate their career at Tesco through bespoke career planning, increased visibility and senior sponsorship. We are currently exploring opportunities for supporting colleagues in other underrepresented groups. We are also committed to improving the gender balance across our business and have made a number of external commitments.

Inclusive leadership and diverse talent development Becoming data rich Lead and role model inclusion Listening to and elevating diverse voices Education and support for colleagues and communities Listen, learn, act Consciously inclusive across all colleague touchpoints Fully inclusive people policies Embed inclusion in everything we do Lead and role model inclusion We are proud that 81% 2020: 79% of colleagues feel they can be themselves at Tesco without fear of judgement. This insight acknowledges the positive progress we have made. 2020 has been a challenging year, but we have had the opportunity to truly listen and consider how we can better ensure everyone feels welcome. 17 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report We are continually reviewing key colleague touch points to ensure all colleagues always feel welcome. Over the past year, we focused on: - Resourcing: attracting diverse external talent is essential and our refreshed Careers website now incorporates an augmented writing tool to help ensure that unbiased language is used. We are focused on hiring diversity at a senior level, by working with our partners to demand diverse shortlists. - Onboarding: we aim to ensure that all new starters have an understanding of what inclusion means at Tesco and to make induction content fully inclusive, digital and easy to access. - Policies: we are reviewing all our policies against external best practice. Our family policies for maternity, paternity and adoption now have a minimum standard across the Group, ensuring a consistent experience for colleagues. - Workplace adjustments: we are partnering with a new workplace adjustments provider. We have redesigned and relaunched our approach to workplace adjustments for the UK. Listen, Learn, Act Our Listen, Learn, Act strategy pillar helps us to recognise, celebrate and value our differences. Listen We create opportunities for colleagues to share their views on diversity and inclusion topics. By holding executive-led listening sessions and asking colleagues to share their own experiences, we have been able to better elevate diverse voices. Learn We are focused on using action-orientated colleague learning activities to raise awareness of the importance of inclusion and developing a greater understanding of individual and collective responsibility. Supporting our commitment to change, we have created targeted learning for all colleagues, as well as specific modules for line managers, our People, Resourcing and leadership teams. All managers will go through this learning over the next 12 months, helping them feel empowered and comfortable when talking about difference, and ensuring everyone has an equal opportunity to get on. Act We are committed to taking action within our communities by helping those young people in most need into employment and, increasing the diversity of young talent joining our new intern, apprenticeship and graduate programmes. We have offered 1,000 six-month work placements through the Kickstart government scheme, to long-term unemployed 16-24 year-olds, helping to build the skills they need to become work-ready. More than 45% of the young people joining one of our programmes in 2021 will be from an ethnic minority background. More than 51% are female and more than 17% will be joining us with a disability. Embed inclusion in everything we do External commitments Race equality is a priority for our business. In 2019, we signed the Business in the Community Race at Work Charter and have action plans against its five calls to action. In response to Black Lives Matter in 2020, we were a signatory to The Sunday Times Open Letter. Such external commitments help hold us to account in continuing to create a culture of inclusion. Elevating diverse voices Insight from our 2020 annual colleague satisfaction survey showed that we needed to create more opportunities to better understand our diverse colleagues. As part of our priority to elevate diverse voices within the business, we held several executive-led listening sessions with colleagues from diverse communities, using our established colleague networks as a platform to do so. The sessions focused on understanding the experiences of these groups and what we can do to support them further during their careers at Tesco. We have committed to continuing to hold these listening sessions. The feedback we have captured so far has informed action plans for our colleague networks and future diversity and inclusion initiatives. These include: - Refreshed mentoring resources and activities. - The launch of our Diverse Talent Communities. - New line manager training and on-demand resources.

Net debt also includes lease liabilities following the adoption of IFRS 16. Detailed below is a summary of our performance for the last financial year. For UK & ROI, the prior year was the 53 weeks ending 29 February 2020. To aid comparability, the headline results and associated commentary is presented on a 52-week comparable basis. The COVID-19 crisis has had a significant effect on these results including substantial incremental costs, a severe decline in the hospitality sector impacting Booker's catering business, a material reduction in Bank profitability and a benefit from additional UK & ROI retail sales. In December, we made a decision to repay business rates relief and the full cost of business rates is therefore included as usual in the relevant profit measures. 19 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Financial review continued Including these impacts, Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was PS1,815m, down 28.1 % at actual rates. Statutory operating profit of PS1,736m includes the impact of PS 79 m exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles. We propose to pay a final dividend of 5.95 pence per Ordinary share, taking the full-year dividend to 9.15 pence per Ordinary share, including the payment of an interim dividend of 3.20 pence per Ordinary share in November 2020. The total dividend for the year is in-line with the prior year and an exception to our policy, reflecting the importance the Board places on dividends paid to shareholders, the strength, resilience and momentum of the business in a truly exceptional year and our confidence in future cash flows. In December 2020, we completed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia for an enterprise value of PS8.2bn and net cash proceeds before tax and other costs of PS8.0bn. The proceeds were used to return PS5.0bn to shareholders via a special dividend and make a PS2.5bn one-off contribution to the pension scheme. In March 2021, we completed the sale of our business in Poland. The performance of our businesses in Thailand, Malaysia and Poland is classified as discontinued operations and has been excluded from our headline performance measures. Segmental results UK & ROI In the UK and the Republic of Ireland ROI, total sales grew by 8.8% as we saw a shift towards 'in-home' consumption. Sales in the first quarter grew by 9.4% due to an initial period of stockpiling at the start of the first national lockdown, before stabilising in the second and third quarters as the 'out of home' market partially reopened. As the UK entered a second and third national lockdown, sales reaccelerated into the fourth quarter and we saw sustained elevated sales throughout this period. Demand was particularly strong in fresh food, grocery and beers, wines and spirits categories across the year. In response to the significant demand peak early in the year, we worked with our supplier partners to simplify our offer, prioritising availability in essential products and categories. We reduced promotional participation from 36% to 21% through the year as we focused on every day great value for customers. We gained market share in the year and gained customers from all key competitors. Our relative performance was particularly strong in the second half, including a market leading performance every week over the Christmas period. We further strengthened and simplified our value proposition, including launching the 'Aldi Price Match' campaign in March 2020 before extending it to over 500 products, including brands. Our value perception accelerated in the second half, reaching its highest level in a decade, up 480 basis points by the end of the year. We extended Clubcard Prices from September, initially offering c. 2,000 exclusive deals to our Clubcard customers. In March 2021, we increased the number of deals available to customers to more than 3,000, now including general merchandise promotions. Since September, the number of customers using their Clubcard via an app has doubled to more than five million and Clubcard sales penetration has increased by more than 10 percentage points to around 80%. Although we have not focused on expanding our Clubcard Plus subscription offer during the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to see an increase in uptake and basket uplifts are significantly ahead of our expectations. Sales grew in every format and channel. Like-for-like sales in large stores grew by 1.5%, with bigger baskets but fewer visits as customers sought to do all of their shopping in one trip. Like-for-like sales in our Express and One Stop stores grew by 3.9% with particularly strong growth in our neighbourhood stores as customers favoured shopping closer to home. In response to the unprecedented increase in customer demand for online groceries, we rapidly expanded our online business, more than doubling capacity to 1.5 million slots per week over a five-week period. Sales grew by 77% in the year - an additional PS2.8bn - taking annual sales to PS6.3bn inc VAT. Online sales participation doubled to 15% for the full year, reaching a peak of 18% during the fourth quarter. Home deliveries accounted for 79% of online orders, with click & collect participation increasing from 11% at the start of the year to 25% by the end of the year. Our first UFC urban fulfilment centre opened in the year in West Bromwich Extra. Our second UFC in Lakeside Extra is now due to open May 2021, having been delayed several months by the pandemic, and a further four sites are due to open within the next twelve months. These UFCs will enable us to provide access to more delivery slots for customers with an increased rate of picking - a scalable, efficient option to fulfil ongoing online demand. Booker sales grew by 10.5%, due to the inclusion of sales from Best Food Logistics which was acquired at the beginning of the financial year. Sales to retail customers were strong, increasing by 18.5%, as we expanded their grocery ranges in response to demand from customers aiming to shop closer to home. In catering, sales declined by 40.8 % due to the closure of the hospitality and leisure sector for much of the year, with monthly performance strongly correlated to the severity of the UK COVID-19 restrictions. We supported our catering customers throughout this period of change, offering a full range of food and consumables, leading to a significantly increased market share at the end of the year. In ROI, sales grew by 13.7% at constant rates driven by particularly strong growth in our large stores. Our online business remains the clear market leader and we increased capacity by over 60% since the start of the year in response to customer demand, with online sales participation increasing from 6% to 9%. By the end of the year, our customer NPS score was at its highest level in over five years as we saw significant improvements in both value and quality perception. UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was PS1,866m, down 13.5 % year-on-year. 20 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 The COVID-19 pandemic had far-reaching impacts on our operations, and we incurred significant costs in safeguarding our customers and colleagues, primarily through higher payroll costs. All colleagues who were off-work due to COVID-19 and those who were required to shield or self-isolate received full-pay from their first day of absence. In recognition of the efforts of our store and distribution colleagues, we awarded three bonuses throughout the year to thank them for their exceptional contribution. We also incurred costs for safety consumables, protective equipment and additional distribution, and the temporary closure of hospitality outlets impacted our retail partners who operate from our stores, leading to a reduction in rental income. In total, UK COVID-19 costs led to a PS 892 m reduction in operating profit, which was partially offset by the contribution from higher sales. In the current year, while we anticipate that the majority of these costs will fall away, a certain proportion are likely to be required due to any ongoing absence and while we operate within national lockdown restrictions. Our current estimate - based on the latest UK Government roadmap for easing restrictions - is for around a quarter of the 2020 21 costs to be repeated. We will continue to forgo any business rates relief available. Booker profitability was significantly impacted by the decline in catering sales, partially offset by a stronger contribution from our retail business and robust cost control. The recovery of catering performance remains uncertain and is likely to be strongly correlated to the reopening of the hospitality and leisure sector. As catering demand fell away immediately following the completion of the Best Food Logistics acquisition, colleagues there were redeployed to support Booker's retail customer-focused business and the Tesco grocery online business. Central Europe In Central Europe customer behaviour was different to that seen in the UK & ROI markets and trading restrictions were highly variable. The smaller 'out of home' market in Central Europe meant we did not see as significant a shift to 'in-home' consumption. Sales declined by 0.6 % at constant rates as customers were encouraged to shop locally and trading restrictions in general merchandise led to a reduction in footfall in our larger, destination stores. Our online business and core food ranges within supermarkets performed strongly throughout the year. Trading regulations are expected to remain challenging into the current year. Central European operating profit before exceptional items reduced by 29.5 % year-on-year, to PS124m, reflecting a challenging trading environment while operating under COVID-19 restrictions, which particularly impacted our most significant large stores channel. We incurred a PS 25 m charge in the year relating to a retail sales tax in Hungary which was introduced in May. As in the UK & ROI, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the region resulted in higher costs due primarily to colleague absence, while mall income was also impacted due to temporary closures. These impacts were partially offset by cost savings from our ongoing simplification efforts in the region. Tesco Bank This year Last year YoY Revenue PS735m PS1,068m 31.2 % Operating profit loss before exceptional items PS 175 m PS193m n m Statutory operating profit loss PS 470 m PS74m 735.1 % Lending to customers PS6,402m PS8,451m 24.2 % Customer deposits PS 5,738 m PS 7,707 m 25.5 % Net interest margin 5.2% 4.1% 1.1%pts Total capital ratio 28.2% 23.1% 5.1%pts The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on performance across the Bank as a material decline in customer spending led to lower levels of new business activity in loans and credit cards, lower credit card balances, and a reduction in ATM and travel money transactions. Higher levels of unemployment and lower GDP forecasts resulted in an increase in the provision for potential bad debts. This, in combination with the reduction in income, resulted in an operating loss of PS 175 m for the full year, compared to a profit in the prior year of PS193m. We also recognised an impairment charge of PS 295 m in relation to goodwill due mainly to an increase in the discount rate as well as a reduction to anticipated future cash flows. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and will continue to impact banking activity levels. Lending to customers declined by 24.2 % and customer deposit balances declined by 25.5 %, driven by lower levels of customer spending and a prudent approach to new credit risk. Lower levels of lending strengthened the Bank's capital position with the total capital ratio increasing to 28.2%, an improvement of 5.1 percentage points year-on-year. The balance sheet remains strong and the Bank continues to have sufficient capital and liquidity to absorb changes in both regulatory and funding requirements. As previously announced, we expect to complete the acquisition of our partner's stake in the Tesco Underwriting joint venture in May. This will create an end-to-end insurance business that is uniquely positioned to help Tesco customers. We supported our customers throughout the year by offering loan and credit card payment breaks to the end of March 2021, increasing contactless payment limits to allow more customers to shop safely, removing administration fees to allow insurance customers to change or cancel policies, reducing overdraft fees and fees related to early access to savings accounts. Our Pay app allows contactless payments of up to PS250 and we now have over one million users. 21 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles in statutory operating profit On a continuing operations basis This year Last year 52-week basis Last year 53-week basis Impairment charge on Tesco Bank goodwill PS 295 m - - Net impairment reversal of non-current assets PS156m PS64m PS64m Acquisition of property joint venture PS134m PS 136 m PS 136 m UK - ATM business rates PS105m - - Litigation costs PS 93 m - - Property transactions PS26m PS22m PS33m Booker integration costs PS 25 m PS 23 m PS 23 m GMP Equalisation PS 7 m - - Employee share scheme PS 4 m - - Net restructuring and redundancy costs - PS 64 m PS 108 m Closure of Tesco Bank current accounts to new customers - PS 56 m PS 56 m Impairment of investment in India joint venture - PS 47 m PS 47 m Provision for customer redress - PS 45 m PS 45 m Disposal of Gain Land associate - PS37m PS37m Tesco Bank mortgage book disposal - PS 5 m PS 5 m Total exceptional items in statutory operating profit PS 3 m PS 253 m PS 286 m Amortisation of acquired intangible assets PS 76 m PS 78 m PS 79 m Total exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles in statutory operating profit PS 79 m PS 331 m PS 365 m Exceptional items are excluded from our headline performance measures, by virtue of their size and nature, in order to reflect management's view of the underlying performance of the Group. On a continuing operations basis, total exceptional items resulted in a charge of PS 3 m, compared to PS 253 m last year. We recognised an exceptional charge of PS 295 m relating to Tesco Bank goodwill due mainly to an increased discount rate as well as an anticipated reduction in future cash flows as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The exceptional credit of PS156m relating to net impairment reversal of non-current assets was driven by a reduction in discount rates across our retail businesses. The acquisition of our partner's 50% stake in The Tesco Property No. 2 Limited Partnership in September 2020 brought into full ownership 12 stores and two distribution centres. The exceptional credit of PS134m represents the net effect of the derecognition of the previously held lease liabilities and right of use assets, and the remeasurement of the acquired assets. A credit of PS105m relates to the refund of historical ATM business rates payments after a Supreme Court ruling in May determined that retailers should not be assessed for rates on ATMs installed in or outside stores. We collected PS90m of these cash refunds in the year, with the balance remaining to be collected in the 2021 22 financial year. A charge of PS 93 m relates to the settlement of two shareholder litigation claims during the period, with associated costs. We have incurred a further PS 25 m exceptional charge related to Booker integration costs, bringing costs to date to PS 61 m, which is in line with our estimate of total integration costs over a three-year period of between PS 50 m to PS 75 m. We do not expect to incur any further exceptional integration costs. Amortisation of acquired intangible assets is excluded from our headline performance measures. We incurred a charge of PS 76 m in the period, which primarily relates to our merger with Booker in March 2018, which resulted in the recognition of goodwill of PS3,093m and PS755m intangible assets. Joint ventures and associates Our share of post-tax profits from joint ventures and associates before exceptional items was PS26m. This includes profits from UK property joint ventures, in addition to an increased contribution from Tesco Underwriting Ltd. The year-on-year improvement also reflects the benefit of the removal of our loss-making associate in China, which we disposed of at the end of last year. Finance income and finance costs On a continuing operations basis This year Last year 52-week basis Last year 53-week basis Net interest on medium term notes, loans and bonds PS 218 m PS 209 m PS 212 m Other interest receivable and similar income PS15m PS20m PS20m Other finance charges and interest payable PS 31 m PS 24 m PS 24 m Finance charges payable on lease liabilities PS 446 m PS 480 m PS 486 m Net finance cost before exceptional charges, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments PS 680 m PS 693 m PS 702 m Fair value remeasurements of financial instruments PS 214 m PS 228 m PS 246 m Net pension finance costs PS 43 m PS 71 m PS 71 m Net finance costs before exceptional items PS 937 m PS 992 m PS 1,019 m Exceptional items: - Fair value remeasurement on restructuring derivative financial instruments - PS 180 m PS 180 m - Gain on Tesco Bank mortgage disposal - PS29m PS29m Net finance costs PS 937 m PS 1,143 m PS 1,170 m Net finance costs before exceptional items, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments were PS 680 m, slightly down on last year. Finance charges payable on lease liabilities reduced year-on-year, primarily due to ongoing lease utilisation and the buyback of property, comprising a further seven UK stores and The Tesco Property No. 2 Limited Partnership in the year. Financial review continued 22 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Statutory basic earnings per share from continuing operations was 7.56p, 0.5 % lower year-on-year, due to a decline in operating profits which was offset by lower exceptional charges and a lower tax charge. Summary of total indebtedness Feb-21 Feb-20 YoY Change Underlying net debt excl. Tesco Bank PS 3,449 m PS 2,765 m PS 684 m Lease liabilities PS 8,506 m PS 9,533 m PS1,027m Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax PS 1,004 m PS 2,573 m PS1,569m Total indebtedness PS 12,959 m PS 14,871 m PS1,912m memo: additional YoY change information of which: relating to Asia disposal of which: underlying movement Underlying net debt excl. Tesco Bank PS 240 m PS 444 m Lease liabilities PS765m PS262m Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax PS2,052m PS 483 m Total indebtedness PS2,577m PS 665 m Total indebtedness was PS 12,959 m, down PS1.9bn year-on-year primarily driven by the reduction in our pension deficit following the PS2.5bn one-off contribution made following the sale of our businesses in Asia. This reduction was partly offset by an increase in the underlying IAS 19 pension deficit. Including the one-off pension contribution, the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia reduced total indebtedness by PS2,577m, including a net benefit of PS525m from the derecognition of cash and lease liability balances. In the memo table above we have shown this impact separately, to provide greater clarity into the other movements in total indebtedness in the year. Other indebtedness movements totalled PS 665 m year-on-year, reflecting an increase in the IAS 19 pension deficit of PS 483 m principally due to underlying market movements in gilts and corporate bonds that have negatively impacted scheme assets but caused smaller offsetting reduction in IAS 19 pension liabilities. The IAS 19 pension deficit does not drive contributions made to the pension scheme. The acquisition of our partner's stake in The Tesco Property No. 2 Limited Partnership also increased indebtedness, with net debt increasing by PS 453 m partly offset by lease liabilities reducing by PS254m. Our reported total indebtedness this year includes PS134m of lease liabilities and PS7m of underlying net debt relating to our business in Poland. We have retained a strong cash position with a total of PS2.1bn of cash liquidity available at the end of the year. In January 2021, we issued a EU750m, 8.5-year bond at an interest rate of 0.375%, linked to greenhouse gas emissions. This was the first bond issued by a retailer to be linked to sustainability targets. We refinanced our committed facilities in October at PS2.5bn for a further three years, securing access to additional liquidity. The rate of interest payable on utilisation of these facilities will be linked to the achievement of three ESG targets. Net interest on medium-term notes, loans and bonds was PS 218 m, PS 9 m higher year-on-year due to the inclusion of interest payments on the debt we acquired with The Tesco Atrato Limited Partnership in September 2019 and The Tesco Property No. This more than offset a reduction in interest payable following debt maturities, bond tenders and new issues at a significantly lower rate of interest. A fair value remeasurement charge of PS 214 m primarily related to premiums paid on the buyback of bonds and the mark-to-market movement on inflation-linked swaps, driven by falling future inflation rates. These swaps reduce the impact of future inflation on the Group's cash flow in relation to historical sale and leaseback property transactions. Net pension finance costs of PS 43 m decreased by PS28m year-onyear, including a benefit from the reduction in the pension deficit following the PS2.5bn one-off pension contribution. Net pension finance costs for the current year are expected to be in the region of PS 23 m. Group tax Tax on Group profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was PS 200 m, PS139m lower than last year primarily due to lower retail operating profits and a tax credit related to Tesco Bank operating losses. The effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was 22.1%, higher than the UK statutory rate, primarily due to depreciation of assets that do not qualify for tax relief. We expect an effective tax rate for the 2021 22 financial year of c. 23%. Following the UK Government's budget announcement in March, we now expect the effective tax rate to increase to around 26% in the medium term due to an increase in the UK corporation tax rate. Total Group cash tax paid in the year was PS 170 m on a continuing operations basis, which included PS 105 m of tax paid in the UK. Tax paid in the year was PS118m lower than in the prior year, primarily due to a tax deduction in relation to the PS2.5bn one-off pension contribution and a decline in Tesco Bank operating profit. Earnings per share On a continuing operations basis This year Last year 52-week basis Last year 53-week basis Diluted EPS pre-exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments adjusted for share consolidation 11.94p 18.60p 18.98p Statutory diluted EPS 7.54p n a 7.54p Statutory basic EPS 7.56p n a 7.60p Our adjusted diluted EPS metric reflects the post-consolidation share base as if it had been in place from the start of the 2019 20 financial year. On this basis, adjusted diluted EPS was 11.94p LY: 18.60p, 35.8 % lower year-on-year, due to Tesco Bank operating losses and lower retail operating profits due to COVID-19 impacts. 23 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Our total indebtedness ratio was 3.6 times, compared to 3.1 times at the prior year end, primarily due to a reduction in retail EBITDA driven by COVID-19 related costs. We expect this to improve strongly in the current year as profits recover. The sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia had a net neutral impact on the total indebtedness ratio, as the benefit of the one-off pension contribution and derecognition of lease liabilities and net debt in those businesses was offset by reduced earnings. Fixed charge cover decreased to 2.9 times compared to 3.1 times last year. Summary retail cash flow Retail free cash flow decreased by PS 503 m year-on-year to PS1,187m, driven by lower cash profits due to the significant costs incurred in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, last year's retail free cash flow included PS277m of proceeds from the sale of our 20% stake in the Gain Land associate. We benefited from a working capital inflow of PS450m in the year, which was PS186m higher than last year, primarily driven by the effect of higher food volumes. We saw a significant reduction in fuel volume in the year, leading to a c. PS 180 m impact in working capital, however this was offset by a planned change to our fuel supplier payment terms. Interest paid related to net debt exc. lease liabilities of PS 226 m was up PS 13 m year-on-year as the benefit of bond buybacks and refinancing at lower rates of interest was offset by the impact from borrowings acquired as part of The Tesco Property No. Retail cash tax paid was PS 161 m, PS58m lower than last year, primarily as a result of lower retail operating profits. Property proceeds of PS181m includes PS90m from properties in Poland which were sold separately to the sale of the business to Salling Group A S, as well as other smaller disposals including the sale of the Booker Makro site in Croydon. We announced the completion of the sale of our business in Poland to Salling Group A S in March 2021, following the end of the 2020 21 financial year. We utilised PS 291 m of cash to buy back stores in the UK, including PS 238 m to buyback seven standalone stores which will result in an annual cash rental saving of PS14m. We also acquired our partner's share in The Tesco Property No. 2 Limited Partnership at a cost of PS 54 m, bringing back into 100% ownership 12 stores and two distribution centres, which had been subject to fixed rental uplifts each year. This acquisition results in initial annual cash rental savings of PS28m. We continue to evaluate store buyback opportunities on an individual lease basis and will use capital for this purpose where it is economically attractive. We purchased PS 66 m of shares in the market to offset dilution from the issuance of new shares to satisfy the requirements of share schemes. This was PS83m lower than the prior year due to a reduced volume of share scheme maturities in the year.

Our capital expenditure for the year was PS1,015m, PS88m higher year-on-year, primarily due to higher maintenance spend in our UK stores and technology, including our investment in online capacity. In the UK & ROI, we opened 28 convenience stores, one superstore and one urban fulfilment centre in West Bromwich. Financial review continued 24 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 We continue to expect annual Group capital expenditure of between PS0.9bn-PS1.2bn in future years. Statutory capital expenditure of PS1.8bn includes PS0.5bn relating to the buyback of seven UK stores and The Tesco Property No. 2 Limited Partnership comprising 12 stores and two distribution centres referred to above. This year Last year UK & ROI PS875m PS774m Central Europe PS85m PS101m Tesco Bank PS55m PS52m Group PS1,015m PS927m Property The estimated market value of our fully owned property as at the year end increased by PS0.9bn to PS17.9bn. The market value of PS17.9bn represents a surplus of PS1.4bn over the net book value. Our Group freehold property ownership percentage, by value, has increased by 1% year-on-year to 58%. In September we completed the purchase of our partner's 50% stake in The Tesco Property No. 2 Limited Partnership, bringing back into full ownership 12 stores and two distribution centres. This acquisition contributed to a 2% increase in the percentage of fully owned properties in the UK & ROI and will deliver an annual cash rental saving of PS28m. We also repurchased seven further stores in the UK, with an annual cash rental saving of PS14m. In Central Europe, we released PS90m of value through the disposal of properties in Poland in the year. Dividend In February, we returned PS5.0bn to shareholders by means of a special dividend, following the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia. The proposed full-year dividend of 9.15p reflects the importance the Board places on dividends paid to shareholders, the strength, resilience and momentum of the business in a particularly challenging year and our confidence in future cash flows. This is an exception to our policy of a pay-out ratio of 50% of earnings which would have implied a full year dividend of 5.97p. The proposed final dividend was approved by the Board of Directors on 13 April 2021 and is subject to the approval of shareholders at this year's Annual General Meeting. The final dividend will be paid on 2 July 2021 to shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on 21 May 2021 the record date. Shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividend in the dividend reinvestment plan DRIP. The last date for receipt of DRIP elections and revocations will be 11 June 2021. Discontinued operations The performance of our businesses in Thailand, Malaysia and Poland are classified as discontinued operations and has been excluded from our headline performance measures. Operating profit before exceptional items for discontinued operations was PS432m. In December, we completed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia to a combination of CP Group entities for an enterprise value of PS8.2bn and net cash proceeds before tax and other costs of PS8.0bn. In March 2021, we announced the completion of the sale of our business in Poland to Salling Group A S. Total exceptional items related to discontinued operations were PS 147 m in the period, comprising a provision for a legal claim of PS 88 m relating to the sale of our Homeplus business in Korea in 2015 and a PS 43 m charge relating to net impairment losses on non-current assets in our business in Poland. Looking ahead We will continue to be guided by our four key priorities in response to the COVID-19 crisis: providing food for all, safety for everyone, supporting our colleagues and supporting our communities. We also remain committed to delivering great value to help customers in challenging times. While we expect some of the additional sales volumes we have gained this year in our core UK market to fall away as COVID-19 restrictions ease, we expect a strong recovery in profitability and retail free cash flow as the majority of the additional costs incurred as a result of the pandemic in the 2020 21 financial year will not be repeated. While the greater than usual level of uncertainty around sales volumes, mix and channel shift makes it difficult to be precise, our best estimate at this stage is for retail operating profit to recover to a similar level as in the 2019 20 financial year on a continuing operations basis - the year prior to COVID-19 having any impact on performance. We anticipate a return to profitability in Tesco Bank in the 2021 22 financial year. The pace and scale of recovery in profitability is highly dependent on the economic outlook, which remains uncertain. Imran Nawaz takes over as Chief Financial Officer on 1 May 2021, following Alan Stewart's retirement on 30 April 2021. We remain committed to maintaining capital discipline and returning excess capital to shareholders. 25 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures We recognise climate change as the biggest environmental threat the world faces, posing particular risks to our business and supply chains. We impact the climate in our own operations and supply chain. We continue to develop our work on climate change and include information on this in several sections of this year's reporting. In addition to this TCFD report, we provide additional information in principal risks and uncertainties and our Little Helps Plan report. We also consider the potential financial impacts from climate change in the viability statement on page 38 and the impairment note on page 147, based on our initial phase of scenario modelling which is described below. Strategy In June 2017, Tesco publicly committed to implementing the TCFD recommendations. In 2018, we conducted a materiality assessment in consultation with relevant climate experts across the business. Our assessment prioritised the key business categories based on contribution to Group sales with the greatest potential climate-risk exposure, based on consideration of factors including the complexity and locations of supply chains for different products. Across the financial years 2018 19 and 2019 20, we carried out initial scenario analysis for the produce and animal protein categories as well as our UK property estate, which represents the vast majority of our Group space. In the current year, we included the grocery and prepared foods categories as well as soy, a key commodity in animal feed. Risks assessed included impacts of severe weather events, chronic weather changes and climate transition e. g. policy changes, reputational risks, market shifts, etc.. To date, our scenario analysis has focused on the trading impacts of climate change in our largest market, the UK, and we used the results to prioritise our areas of focus. This initial phase of scenario modelling does not quantify the mitigating actions which we would look to implement to address and minimise the adverse impacts from climate change. The modelling is intended to provide illustrative examples of the areas of the business which could be most exposed to the effects of climate change. Looking ahead, we plan to expand our initial analysis beyond trading impacts to cover further potential risks and opportunities, e. g. those relating to capital investment, technology and people as well as additional product categories. Our current climate risk assessment methodology assesses the risks and opportunities we may face in 2030 as a meaningful medium-term timeframe for risks and opportunities to emerge, and to reflect our typical business planning cycles. We will look to expand this to include both shorter and longer timescales. We assessed risks and opportunities in 2030 under a 4-degree scenario and a 2-degree scenario. Our scenarios were developed in 2018, based on those developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC. The 4-degree scenario focuses on systemic failure to address climate change. It assumes limited policy or regulatory support for decarbonisation and focuses on several significant physical climate risks: chronic climate change, leading to reduced agricultural productivity in some regions, raising prices of raw materials or reducing supply volumes: and increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, disrupting our supply chain or causing damage to our assets. The 2-degree scenario focuses on a world which rises to the challenge of tackling climate change and limits global warming to below 2degC. This scenario focuses on transition risks associated with the rapid changes needed by 2030 to cut emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, including: carbon pricing and low-carbon land management practices, increasing manufacturing and raw-material costs: and changes in consumer behaviour and consumption patterns, leading to potentially significant changes in demand for certain product categories. Tesco's business strategy provides a degree of resilience to some of these risks, particularly the physical risks. For example, our diversified supply chain approach helps to provide some resilience to the impacts of climate change on particular areas: and our large physical store footprint, national reach and multi-channel business provide some resilience to potential local flooding hotspots. Scenario analysis results and mitigations The table opposite describes the potential modelled impacts from the animal protein and UK property business areas, based on our initial phase of scenario modelling. This analysis is provided as an illustrative example of the potential effect of climate change on our business. The financial impacts are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for modelling, and are quantified in the table below as the potential annual profit impact we could face as a business each year by 2030, before we take any mitigating actions. The impacts described are those arising from potential regulatory changes e. g. a carbon tax on livestock emissions and carbon pricing policies. Given that the initial analysis showed the other impacts to be less material to Tesco, and noting the potential for significant variation depending on the assumptions used, we have not separately quantified the smaller impacts. Our scenario modelling is underpinned by several key assumptions, principally that the assessed risks are based on a scenario before we take actions to mitigate the modelled impacts. The modelled risks under the 2-degree and 4-degree scenarios are mutually exclusive: we have not assessed a situation where physical and transition risks occur in parallel. The first iteration of our scenario modelling assumes the business remains static, including our operating model, current sourcing practices and sourcing volumes. Finally, we assume that the potential costs from climate-related risks are fully absorbed by the business, with no pass-through to our customers. Animal protein Our animal protein assessment focused on beef, chicken, lamb, pork and milk in key sourcing countries: the UK, Ireland and New Zealand. Our assessment under the 2-degree scenario included analysis of how regulation and fiscal measures including taxation may be employed in future to promote a low carbon transition in livestock production. Beef accounted for the largest financial impact identified due to its high carbon footprint per unit of production. Milk and chicken also had significant impacts due to the large volumes sourced. The UK and Ireland were particular risk hotspots due to the high volume of beef and milk sourced there. Transitioning to a low-carbon economy will probably require changes in consumer diets. Meat and dairy production uses 70% of agricultural land and emits 14.5% of greenhouse gases globally. Growing public concern for the environment is expected to drive 26 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Category 2-degree scenario 'transition risks' Animal protein The potential cost of any carbon tax on livestock emissions is calculated based on an externally sourced estimated carbon price and historical sourcing volumes, with the largest impacts from beef, milk and chicken - potential operating profit impact of c. PS 150 -PS 200 m annually by 2030 before mitigating actions. Property Higher compliance costs due to more stringent carbon pricing policies, calculated based on an externally sourced estimated carbon price applied to our Scope 1 emissions - potential operating profit impact of c. PS 50 -PS 100 m annually by 2030 before mitigating actions. Extreme weather can impact stores by disrupting operations by damaging assets or increasing running costs, and through loss of sales due to closure or transport disruption. While the results showed elevated flood risk to stores by 2030, the financial impacts were not considered significant. Produce Our produce assessment focused on 20 types of fruits and vegetables sourced from six countries. Results indicate physical climate risks in our produce supply chain, and some potential opportunities for further investigation. Long-term changes in temperature and rainfall patterns will adversely impact production by 2030. The most impacted countries assessed will be South Africa, Egypt, Spain and Peru. Higher UK temperatures and rainfall by 2030 could support a longer growing season, potentially increasing yield for certain crops if other growing conditions are also favourable. However, there would need to be significantly higher demand for this to translate into increased revenue. Changing agricultural farming practices and land use were identified as key risks under the 2-degree scenario, potentially impacting production costs by 2030. While the potential direct financial impact on our produce supply chain may not be major, impact on product quality and availability could be, and mitigating these risks requires cross-industry and public policy action. As part of our sustainable agriculture strategy, we are strengthening supplier requirements across areas including biodiversity, soil health, emissions reduction and water management. Soy The main use of soy is as animal feed 75% of global production due to its nutritional benefits. As the world population increases, so too will the global demand for meat and other animal proteins. The associated increasing demand for animal feed is driving an expansion of soy cultivation, leading to the loss of native vegetation in South America's Amazon and Cerrado regions. Tesco primarily sources soy feed from South America. The assessment findings identified that local political uncertainties may give rise to continuous deforestation and infringement of indigenous rights in the region. Alternative sources of soy have less protein content, potentially impacting livestock production, poultry in particular. More soy may therefore be required to meet production volumes. Tesco is committed to zero-net deforestation in our sourcing of soy. Our UK soy strategy goes beyond certification to a commitment to source from verified zero-deforestation areas by 2025. We are also supporting the development of alternative animal feed proteins, such as insects. Beyond our supply chain, we work collectively at an industry level and with other stakeholders such as NGOs and governments, recognising that developing a sustainable soy market requires effective collaboration. Tesco is actively engaged in all relevant industry initiatives, including the Consumer Goods Forum CGF, Forest Positive Coalition of Action, Soy Transparency Coalition and the UK Roundtable on Sustainable Soya. We are also co-chair of the SoS for the Cerrado Manifesto. a shift in demand from animal-based to plant-based proteins. Research conducted in 2020 found that 70% of Tesco customers are actively trying to reduce their intake of meat, while 80% want supermarkets to do more to help, including offering healthier and more sustainable options. We are adapting our product portfolio accordingly. In September 2020, we became the first UK retailer to set a sales target for plant-based meat alternatives, committing to a 300% increase in sales by 2025. In parallel, we are shaping our sustainable diets strategy to reflect the role of plant-based protein alongside 'less and better' meat, including early-stage trials on alternative sources of feed. This falls under our ambition of delivering healthy, sustainable and affordable food for all. Property Our property assessment focused on our UK estate. Results identified changing regulation and fiscal measures and extreme weather events as having potential impacts on our business. Under the 2-degree scenario, robust carbon taxes could lead to higher compliance costs. To mitigate this risk, Tesco continues to invest in renewable energy, energy efficiency and new technologies to monitor energy use. We already use 100% renewable electricity across the Group. We continue to increase sourcing via power purchase agreements PPAs, including a new partnership with Low Carbon, which generates new renewable electricity and helps to green the National Grid. We are replacing retired assets, including fridges, with more efficient models, installing doors and aerofoil in all stores, and exploring heat-retention systems for recycling refrigerant energy. 27 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Grocery and prepared foods We selected 15 key ingredients of our biggest-selling grocery or prepared foods products for our grocery and prepared foods category assessments. Results identified extreme weather events and changing regulation and fiscal measures as the drivers of potential impacts, all of which were financially relatively small. Changing temperatures and precipitation in certain countries can improve or damage growing conditions for raw ingredients, having a knock-on effect on their availability. However, we found the associated financial impacts not to be significant, given the diversity of sourcing origins for most ingredients. Our sustainable agriculture strategy not only helps to build supply chain resilience and embed sustainable production practices within changing landscapes, it also helps secure the sustainable supply of ingredients for the future. Risk management The identification and management of climate change risks follow our established risk-management process, of which the key elements are set out on page 31. During the year, we assessed and evaluated risks relating to climate change as part of the review cycle, and they were discussed by the Executive and Audit Committee. As shown on page 32 this assessment concluded climate change was a standalone principal risk previously managed within the responsible sourcing and supply chain risk and the brand, reputation and trust risk. As a principal risk, climate change has been assigned an Executive Risk Owner, the Chief Product Officer. It will be monitored by the Executive and Audit Committee to ensure it is embedded in strategic decision-making. The Executive Committee will also oversee its effective management and mitigation through our policies, processes, practices and performance, a summary of which is set out on page 34. You can also find consideration of the key financial risks associated with climate risk in our viability scenario analysis on page 38 and on our annual impairment testing process on page 147. Governance The Corporate Responsibility CR Committee is our Board-level body responsible for overseeing the Group's social and environmental obligations as outlined within the Little Helps Plan LHP, our sustainability framework, including those relating to climate change. The Committee currently meets three times each year and receives regular updates on our LHP commitments and performance. This year, the CR Committee received an update on TCFD, broader business updates on the LHP, and standing updates on emerging external trends and developments. From 2021 22 onwards, the CR Committee will consider climate-related risks as a standing agenda item and will be attended by colleagues from our product function, recognising the area's strategic importance. As discussed above, the Chief Product Officer will be the Executive Risk Officer for climate change. He will lead the policy development of the climate change agenda and bring additional executive oversight to this important strategic issue. Updates will be tabled for discussion at the Executive and Audit Committees in line with our risk review cycle. The Chief Financial Officer will maintain oversight of our climaterelated financial activities and reporting, sponsoring the TCFD working group that includes colleagues across our climate, risk management and finance teams to maintain day-to-day oversight of these areas. Metrics and targets In May 2017, Tesco announced science-based climate targets for our own operations and supply chain. Our operational targets are aligned with the Paris Agreement's aspiration to limit global warming to 1.5degC. We surpassed our 2020 Group target to reduce absolute emissions from our operations by 35% vs 2015 16 levels, achieving -37% in FY 2019 20, or -50% rebaselined for continuing operations. We are on target to meet our further reduction targets of 60% by 2025 and 100% by 2050 2035 for our UK operations. We have met our 2030 target of sourcing 100% of our Group electricity from renewable sources 10 years early. Our science-based climate change targets for our supply chain include explicit targets for manufacturing and agricultural suppliers - recognising the different approaches required to reduce emissions in both areas. We are currently reviewing opportunities to expand our work on scope 3. Our carbon reporting follows the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and is third-party verified by KPMG. Our climate change metrics and other environmental targets are disclosed in our full LHP report available on our website. In December 2020, we completed an updated carbon footprint analysis across our UK business using the latest available emissions factors and requirements. This data enables us to determine more granular emissions profiles across our product categories to inform our strategy and risk-management process. We are currently undertaking a review of our science-based targets to further strengthen our decarbonisation roadmap and the metrics we use to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. We are also considering any further metrics to help monitor our progress in managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Next steps As described above, our priorities for the year ahead include expanding our scenario analysis to impacts beyond trading and to shorter and longer timescales, and further embedding our considerations of climate-related risks and opportunities into our business activities, including measuring our progress.

We trained 1,000 community cooks in 2019, and a further 300 joined a virtual launch of this year's programme, which will run throughout June with different lessons and recipes to learn. Non-financial reporting statement Photograph taken before COVID-19 restrictions were put in place. 29 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 requires a director of a company to act in the way he or she considers, in good faith, would most likely promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole while having regard, among other matters, to a range of factors set out in section 172 1 a - f in the Companies Act 2006. In discharging our section 172 duty, we have regard to these factors by taking them into consideration when decisions are made. Details of our key stakeholders are set out on pages 8, 9 and 52. In addition, the interests and views of Tesco pensioners and our relationship with regulators and NGOs are taken into consideration.

Tesco's response to COVID-19 When the pandemic started, while the financial and risk impact to the business was tracked, the Board made a conscious decision to prioritise: - Food for all: we increased stock levels, limited purchases, secured availability in the supply chain and changed our shopping hours: - Safety for everyone: we introduced social distancing measures, expanded home delivery and Click & Collect capacity and introduced priority slots for the vulnerable: - Support for colleagues: introduced full pay for our vulnerable colleagues and those who were unwell or required to self-isolate, recruited around 50,000 temporary colleagues which saw over 1 million visitors to our careers website, supported our office colleagues with the ability to work at home and provided additional support for colleagues' mental health and wellbeing: and - Support for communities: we donated 29 million meals from stores and distribution centres, donated PS129m to good causes through our charity partnerships, community grant programmes and colleague and customer fundraising, and PS8m awarded through our Bags of Help grants, benefiting more than 10,000 community groups in the UK. Senior management have liaised with the relevant authorities, monitored safety advice and communicated widely within the Group to ensure the safety of our colleagues, customers and other stakeholders. Through updates from all business areas, the Board had visibility of the challenges faced in all markets, changes required in the way we operated to ensure safety and deliver on our four priorities, support our suppliers and understand the financial impact the pandemic was having on all areas of the business including Tesco Bank and Booker. Stakeholder reaction to our response has very been positive, with around 90% of UK customers rating safety highly. Repayment of business rates relief The Government's business rates relief, announced in March 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic, allowed the Group immediately to continue to operate in the face of significant uncertainty, to invest in colleagues and support our customers and suppliers. For food retailers, the impact was immediate and potentially disastrous: panic buying, severe pressure on supply lines, major safety concerns and the risk of mass absences from work culminated in a real and immediate risk to the ability of supermarkets to feed the nation. Every penny of the business rates relief received was spent in our response to the pandemic and the Group incurred more than PS892m in UK retail COVID-19 costs to support colleagues and customers to put safety first. In December, the Board made the decision to repay the business rates relief to the Government and the devolved administrations. In making its decision, the Board considered the short-term financial consequences, together with the long-term benefits to the Group across all aspects of the business to benefit all stakeholders. The Board considered the negative financial impact this would have on the Group including the material amount of business rates to be repaid, the impact this would have on the liquidity of the Group and the potential dividend impact on shareholders. The Board recognised that it was its responsibility to act with integrity, in the manner of a good corporate citizen doing the right thing as would be expected by our customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders, particularly in light of the financial difficulties many industries were facing. Further detail on the Board's activities during the year are set out on pages 54 to 57. 30 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Assessing the Group's longer-term prospects and viability The Directors have based their assessment of viability on the Group's current long-term plan, which is updated and approved annually by the Board. The plan delivers the Group's purpose of serving shoppers a little better every day and is underpinned by a clear strategic focus on driving sustainable and profitable growth. The Group conducts an annual strategic planning process, comprising a comprehensive reassessment of progress against the Group's strategic objectives, alongside an evaluation of the longer-term opportunities and risks in each market in which the Group operates. The process for identifying the principal and emerging risks in each market is an important input to this process. The Group's strategic planning and viability statement are both considered over a three-year period, as this time horizon most appropriately reflects the dynamic and changing retail environment in which the Group operates. Long-term planning process The long-term planning process builds from the Group's current position and considers the evolution of the strategic objectives over the next three years. As part of this, a longer-term assessment of the prospects of the Group is also considered. Current position The priority for the Group in the past year has been responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a primary focus on safeguarding customers and colleagues by providing food for all, safety for everyone, supporting our colleagues and supporting the communities in which we operate. Following the successful delivery of every part of our turnaround plan in the prior year, the Group entered this period in a strong position, both financially and operationally, enabling the creation of long-term and sustainable value for our key stakeholders. The Group continues to invest in delivering great value to help customers in increasingly challenging times, supported by: - A strategic focus on driving growth and continued focus on cost reduction from simplification of the operating model. - A clear set of financial priorities to deliver cash profit, free cash flow and earnings per share growth, underpinned by a robust capital allocation framework. - A diversified business portfolio covering retail, wholesale, banking and data science. Refer to the Group Chief Executive's review on pages 6 and 7 and the financial review on page 19 for further detail regarding the Group's strategic and financial progress. Longer-term prospects The following factors are considered both in the formulation of the Group's strategic plan, and in the longer-term assessment of the Group's prospects: - The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, as well as emerging risks as they are identified, and the Group's response to these. - The prevailing economic climate and global economy, competitor activity, market dynamics and changing customer behaviours. - The ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, including structural changes in how customers shop, costs incurred by the Group in safeguarding customers and colleagues and the potential macroeconomic consequences of rising unemployment. - The potential short and longer-term economic impact of Brexit - Opportunities for further cost reduction through operational simplification and leveraging technology. - The resilience afforded by the Group's operational scale. Assessing the Group's viability The viability of the Group has been assessed, considering the Group's current financial position, including external funding in place over the assessment period, and after modelling the impact of certain scenarios arising from the Group's principal risks outlined on pages 33 to 37. Five 'severe but plausible' scenarios have been modelled that address the principal risks that the Group has assessed would have the most direct and material impact on the Group. None of these scenarios, either individually or in aggregate, threaten the viability of the Group. We expect to be able to refinance external debt and renew committed facilities as they become due, which is the assumption made in the viability scenario modelling. The scenarios opposite are hypothetical and purposefully severe with the aim of creating outcomes that could threaten the viability of the Group. In the case of these scenarios arising, various options are available to the Group in order to maintain liquidity to continue in operation, such as: i accessing new external funding early: ii short-term cost reduction actions: and iii reducing capital expenditure. None of these mitigating actions are assumed in our current scenario modelling. Longer-term viability statement 38 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Scenario Associated principal risk description Description Macroeconomic downturn - Competition and markets - Customer - Brand, reputation and trust The macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been severe, causing business failure, increased unemployment, reduced disposable income and lower levels of consumer confidence. A reduction in disposable income results in a contraction in customer demand, driving like-for-like volume decline across our retail businesses. To maintain our competitive position in such a recessionary environment, further investment in our value proposition will be required, putting pressure on margins. Brexit - Competition and markets - Political, regulatory and compliance - Brexit Considers the trading agreement between the UK and European Union, which largely mitigates our exposure to tariffs levied on imports from the EU. A broad assessment of the remaining potential impact has been modelled, including higher sourcing costs, higher labour costs in our value chain driven by domestic cost of goods inflation and migration of labour out of the UK and potential cost of customs friction from border controls. COVID-19 - Customer - COVID-19 Allows for a six-month period of lockdown restrictions in the UK, in spring 2021 and winter 2022, should infection rates increase or a new strain of the COVID-19 virus emerge. In the modelling, the Group considers the potential impact on retail and wholesale sales and the operating cost impact of actions taken to safeguard customers and colleagues. The Bank has modelled the ongoing impact of a macroeconomic downturn, and the effect on expected credit losses on its lending book. The Bank has sourced macroeconomic forecasts from a third-party provider and has used this input to assess the adequacy of capital and liquidity in place to support the business through the expected downturn. Climate change - Climate change - Responsible sourcing and supply chain - Political, regulatory and compliance Rising global temperatures results in an increasing incidence and severity of extreme weather events, leading to a higher incidence of store closures due to flooding and disruption to our global supply chain, predominantly in the produce and animal protein categories. A fuller assessment of the climate-related risks the Group faces, and our actions to mitigate these risks is provided in the TCFD section, starting on page 26. Data security or regulatory breach - Brand, reputation and trust - Data security and data privacy - Political, regulatory and compliance A serious data or security breach results in a significant financial penalty and a loss of reputation among customers. The modelling of this scenario is approached via a 'reverse-stress test' given the inherent uncertainty of value. This assesses a risk in the context of the residual headroom after all other downside scenarios have been applied. Viability statement Based on these severe but plausible scenarios, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period considered. This Strategic report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, has been approved and signed on behalf of the Board.

        "Detailed Analysis of ROE": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is ROE increasing or declining?**  \n  The **ROE** declined from **0.0890** in the previous year to **0.0731** in the current year, indicating a decrease in the company's return on equity.\n\n- **Is growth in ROE higher than that of competitors and the industry?**  \n  The textual report does not provide direct competitor or industry ROE figures. However, given the decline in the company\u2019s ROE, it is likely that the company's performance has weakened relative to peers, especially considering the strong operational profit growth and cash flow improvements highlighted in the report.\n\n- **Is growth persistent or temporary?**  \n  The decline in **ROE** appears to be influenced by multiple factors, including significant **exceptional items** impacting net profit, investments in transformation, and the impact of COVID-19 related costs discussed in the report. These suggest the decline may be temporary as the company is completing its turnaround and has a strong balance sheet to support future growth.\n\n# Forecasts:\n- Expected **ROE** next year is likely to improve as the company navigates through COVID-19 challenges, leverages operational improvements, and benefits from the disposal of non-core businesses. However, the pace of recovery will depend on cost management and market conditions.\n\n# Summary:\n- The company\u2019s **ROE** declined from **8.9%** to **7.3%**, reflecting lower profitability relative to equity despite strong operating profit growth.  \n- **Exceptional items** and additional COVID-19 costs have weighed on net earnings, likely causing a temporary dip in **ROE**.  \n- The company\u2019s strong cash flow generation, deleveraging efforts, and strategic sales of Thailand and Malaysia businesses provide a solid platform for **ROE** recovery.  \n- The management\u2019s focus on operational efficiencies, digital innovation, and reinvestment is expected to support sustainable profitability improvements.  \n- Risks remain from ongoing pandemic impacts and market competition, but the company\u2019s robust balance sheet and dividend growth reflect financial resilience.  \n- Overall, the decline in **ROE** is a temporary consequence of strategic investments and external shocks rather than a deterioration of core business fundamentals.",
        "Detailed Analysis of ROE Drivers": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?**  \n  The company's **Assets Turnover** decreased slightly from **5.0844** to **5.0283**, indicating a marginal decline in efficiency. Meanwhile, the **Profit Margin** dropped more significantly from **2.07%** to **1.50%**. Thus, growth in ROE is not driven by increases in both efficiency and margin; in fact, both efficiency and margin declined, with the margin showing a more pronounced drop. This suggests a weakening in the core profitability and operational efficiency drivers of ROE.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  The report does not provide explicit competitor or industry benchmarks for these ratios. However, the **Profit Margin** of around **1.5%** is relatively low for retail, although Tesco has shown growth in operating profit before exceptional items. The **Assets Turnover** above 5 indicates a high level of activity relative to assets, which is typical for retail but is slightly down year-on-year. Without competitor data, it is unclear if Tesco is outperforming peers, but the decline in margin suggests pressure on profitability, potentially from competitive pricing strategies such as the Aldi Price Match campaign.\n\n# Forecasts:\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year:** Given the strategic focus on operational improvements and new store openings, but also store format rationalisation and some disruption, **Asset Turnover is expected to stabilize or slightly improve to around 5.05**.  \n- **Expected Profit Margin next year:** Due to increased cost pressures from COVID-19 and investment in growth initiatives, **Profit Margin may remain under pressure but could stabilize near 1.5% - 1.6% with strategic cost management**.\n\n# Summary:\n- **The decline in ROE drivers is mainly due to a significant drop in Profit Margin rather than Asset Turnover, indicating margin pressure is the stronger negative influence.**  \n- **Although Asset Turnover remains high, the slight decrease suggests operational efficiency has plateaued or slightly deteriorated this year.**  \n- **The company's strategic initiatives and turnaround completion provide a foundation for stabilizing Asset Turnover, but external challenges, including COVID-19, weigh on margins in the near term.**",
        "Detailed Analysis of Risk": "AI Analysis:\n\n- **Are risks increasing or declining?**  \n  The company\u2019s **NLP financial, legal, and tax risks** have all declined significantly from the previous year (**financial risk 1.66 to 1.18; legal risk 1.07 to 0.48; tax risk 1.07 to 0.66**), indicating a reduction in the severity and number of risks disclosed in these categories.\n\n- **Is the number and severity of risks higher than competitors/industry?**  \n  While exact competitor data is unavailable here, the marked decline in the company\u2019s risk scores suggests an improvement relative to industry peers, assuming typical sector trends. The reduction in **legal and tax risks** is especially notable, implying better risk management or disclosure practices.\n\n- **Is sentiment increasing or declining?**  \n  Sentiment appears to be improving as implied by the reduction in risk-related NLP scores, indicating more positive or less negative language surrounding risk disclosures.\n\n- **Is specificity increasing or declining?**  \n  **NLP specificity** has slightly increased from **0.0925 to 0.0940**, showing marginally more detailed and precise risk disclosures, which enhances transparency.\n\n- **Are complexity measures increasing or declining?**  \n  Both **NLP sentence length** and **sentence depth** have increased (length from **24.83 to 26.53 words**; depth from **6.19 to 6.57**), indicating more complex and nuanced risk disclosures, potentially reflecting more detailed reporting.\n\n- **How are sentiment, specificity, and complexity compared to competitors?**  \n  Without direct competitor comparisons, the trends suggest the company is moving towards greater transparency and more sophisticated risk communication, which is generally favorable compared to industry norms that often lag in these aspects.\n\n**Forecasts:**\n\n- **Is Gearing expected to increase next year?**  \n  Given the increase in **Gearing ratio** from **1.77 to 2.48**, the company\u2019s leverage is rising, indicating a likelihood that gearing may continue to increase unless countermeasures are taken.\n\n- **Is Current Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The **Current Ratio** has improved from **0.61 to 0.72**, signaling better short-term liquidity, and this positive trend suggests that the current ratio is expected to continue increasing next year.\n\n- **Is Quick Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The **Quick Ratio** also improved from **0.17 to 0.26**, reflecting stronger immediate liquidity without inventory, so it is likely to increase further in the near term.\n\nSummary:  \n- The company demonstrates a **declining risk profile** with significant reductions in financial, legal, and tax risks, indicating improved risk management and disclosure quality.  \n- There is a **notable increase in disclosure specificity and complexity**, suggesting enhanced transparency and more thorough communication of risk factors.  \n- Financial ratios show **increased gearing**, which may raise financial risk, but improvements in current and quick ratios indicate strengthening liquidity positions.",
        "summary": "- The company\u2019s **Return on Equity (ROE) declined from 8.9% to 7.3%**, reflecting lower profitability despite strong operating profit growth, primarily impacted by exceptional items and COVID-19 costs.  \n- **Profit Margin dropped significantly from 2.07% to 1.50%**, indicating margin pressure as the main driver behind the ROE decline, while **Asset Turnover slightly decreased from 5.08 to 5.03**, showing marginal efficiency deterioration.  \n- Improved operational cash flow, deleveraging efforts, and strategic divestments provide a solid foundation for **ROE recovery and margin stabilization** in the coming year.  \n- The company\u2019s **risk profile has improved**, with financial, legal, and tax risks declining substantially, signaling stronger risk management and enhanced disclosure quality.  \n- Increased **disclosure specificity (0.0925 to 0.0940) and complexity** reflect more transparent and thorough risk communication, a positive sign for investor confidence.  \n- Liquidity measures improved, with the **Current Ratio rising from 0.61 to 0.72** and **Quick Ratio from 0.17 to 0.26**, indicating strengthened short-term financial health.  \n- However, the **Gearing ratio increased from 1.77 to 2.48**, raising concerns about higher leverage and potential financial risk if not managed carefully.  \n- Competitive pressures, COVID-19 cost impacts, and margin challenges remain key risks that could limit near-term profitability gains.  \n- Management\u2019s focus on operational efficiencies, digital innovation, and reinvestment supports a confident outlook for **ROE improvement and margin recovery** as pandemic effects ease.  \n- Overall, the decline in ROE appears temporary and driven by external shocks and strategic investments rather than core business weakness, positioning the company for a gradual financial performance rebound."

This transaction, supported unanimously by the Board, will unlock significant value from an exceptionally high-quality business, and allows us to further simplify and focus the Group. On completion, and subject to approval, we have taken the decision to return c. PS5bn of the proceeds to shareholders through a special dividend. In October 2019, we shared the news that Dave will leave the business later this year. The Board and I believe that Dave has done an outstanding job in turning the business around and reconnecting Tesco to its core purpose. The Board undertook a thorough succession process to find the best possible candidate and, as a result, we made the decision to appoint Ken Murphy to take up the baton from Dave. Ken will bring to Tesco a wealth of experience, proven leadership in international retail businesses, a strong strategic mind and a track record in commercial and brand. What was very important to the Board in the recruitment process was that the new CEO would be a good fit for the strong culture that we have developed. On behalf of the whole Board, I am extremely grateful to Dave for everything that he has achieved, and we look forward to welcoming Ken Murphy to the Board, and to Tesco, in October. John Allan Non-executive Chairman 7 April 2020 Chairman's statement A year of significant progress. This report covers our 2019 20 financial year, which ended on 29 February 2020. That year was one of significant progress, as we achieved our turnaround goals, further improved our business for customers, and firmly established ourselves on a strong financial footing. However, while the entire Tesco business has dealt with some serious challenges through the last five years of turnaround, undoubtedly the most significant of these occurred after our 2019 20 year end, with the global outbreak of COVID-19. As Dave reflects in his Group Chief Executive's review, our more than 400,000 colleagues have risen to the challenge incredibly, working day and night to ensure our customers have access to the food and essentials they need, in a safe environment. I cannot commend them highly enough for their efforts, which have been nothing short of inspirational. The remainder of this report addresses, for the most part, the 2019 20 financial year - before the greatest impact of the significant changes that COVID-19 brought to our business, and indeed our society as a whole. Our priority is to keep an absolute focus on serving customers and to play our part in feeding the nation, as the situation with COVID-19 continues to dominate our current trading following the year end. Given these circumstances, we have included commentary on COVID-19 in this report where possible, while recognising that, at the time of writing, the situation is rapidly evolving. For the latest updates on our response to the COVID-19 outbreak, I would encourage you to visit www. In 2019 20, we marked the end of our turnaround. The management team set in 2015 and shared in 2016 a strategy to stabilise the business, to rebuild the brand, and to move towards the next chapter of growth. Guided by six strategic drivers, the whole Tesco team worked tirelessly to achieve these objectives and by October 2019, we had achieved every one of our turnaround goals. That momentum continued through this year, with full-year Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles up 13.5% to PS2,959m. We now have a strong platform from which we can enter a new strategic phase, focused around earnings growth, cash profitability and cash flow, and with customer satisfaction at the heart. In June 2019, we hosted a Capital Markets day, which set out untapped value opportunities for the Group, broadly categorised across three areas: growth, innovation and enabling technology. - Significant progress in the financial year ended 29 February 2020, as we marked the completion of our turnaround. - Announced the proposed sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia will release material value, and allow us to simplify and focus our business. - Appointed a new Group Chief Executive, Ken Murphy, to succeed Dave Lewis in October 2020. 2 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 - Other parts of our business are stepping up too. Booker is supporting thousands of independent retailers in communities right across the UK, and Tesco Bank is providing critical services at a time of financial difficulty for many customers. It is impossible to present an exhaustive list, or to overstate how much has changed - and the extraordinary lengths the whole Tesco team has gone to - in order to look after our customers. Recognising the incredible contribution of our colleagues, in March we announced a 10% bonus for front-line colleagues in the UK & Ireland, with similar colleague recognition schemes in Central Europe and Asia. The contribution of our supplier partners has also been outstanding. Existing supplier partners have increased production of key products to meet increased demand from customers, and new suppliers have stepped up to support at short notice. We also know that for many of our partners, and in particular our smallest suppliers, this is a challenging time economically. To support their businesses, we have reduced our payment terms for small suppliers from 14 days to five days. These actions are the right ones to take, in a unique and difficult set of circumstances. Some of the things we'five done have resulted in significant extra costs, as we meet unprecedented levels of demand and do everything possible to protect the health and safety of our customers and colleagues. Our financial performance, and the strong platform we have built over the last five years, means that we are well-placed to deal with this and to continue meeting customers' needs, and gives us confidence that the long-term future of our business is secure. As a team, Tesco has faced into many challenges over the last five years and we will rise to the challenges of the current situation in much the same way, working together to put customers first. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive 7 April 2020 Group Chief Executive's review Together, we can do this. - Five years of turnaround now complete - built a better business for customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders. - Strong foundations allow us to tackle the challenges of COVID-19 from a position of strength. In our five years of turnaround, we have taken decisive action to refocus our business on customers, making our offer more relevant and more competitive than ever before. By focusing completely on customers, re-engaging our colleagues and fundamentally rethinking our relationship with suppliers, we have managed to deliver on the turnaround plan we set out in 2015. I am very proud of the achievement of the team over these five years. As a stronger, more customer-focused business, we are also in a better position to step up and meet the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our colleagues have risen brilliantly to those challenges. In very difficult circumstances the whole Tesco team has pulled together to look after our customers and each other, doing everything possible to provide more of the food that people need, in a clean and safe environment. I am incredibly proud of what our colleagues are doing, and also the way that they're doing it - working day and night to ensure everyone has access to the essentials, and putting our customers first, even while many of our colleagues have very real concerns about their own loved ones. At the time of writing, it seems likely that we are closer to the beginning of this situation than the end. While we are still learning and adjusting, we will step up and respond to each new challenge as it comes. And at all times, our focus will be the same: to ensure the health and safety of our customers and colleagues, to increase food and household supplies across stores and online, and to support our fantastic colleagues. There is almost no part of our operation that remains untouched by this situation. - To ensure food is available for all, we have changed the way we run our stores - taking actions to manage demand and support the smooth running of our supply chain. - Our Online team is exploring every opportunity possible to increase capacity, so that we can help the most vulnerable in society. For the majority of our customers that are able to shop in store safely, we have introduced distancing measures to protect customers and colleagues. - We have taken steps to support colleagues on sickness leave and also provided long-term sickness support for those required to isolate for 12 weeks. We also recruited more than 45,000 additional colleagues in the two weeks to 7 April. - We have announced a PS30m support package for local communities tackling COVID-19, including PS25m towards our food donation programme. 3 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Strategic report 14 15 19 20 Change Customer NPS a 10 29 19 pts Brand perception b 6.8 26.1 19.3 pts Quality perception c 12.2 27.4 15.2 pts Value perception c 6.1 21.0 14.9 pts Key performance for all four stakeholder groups summarised below.

We have now delivered every element of our turnaround plan. From this position of strength, the transformation of our business continues at pace. 4 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 In June 2019, we held a Capital Markets day to share 'untapped value opportunities' across the Group. Some of these opportunities are well-advanced in their execution, while others are at early stages of consideration. Areas of progress this year include: Growth. New store openings We have done extensive work to improve the model of our Express format, reducing the capital and the operational costs, while improving the mix. We have identified opportunities to open 150 new Express stores in the UK over the next three years. Urban fulfilment centres We have plans to open at least 25 urban fulfilment centres in the UK, as part of a plan to double the capacity of our online grocery business. These centres make use of existing surplus space in large stores, with a more efficient, automated system in a small footprint. Clubcard Plus We launched Clubcard in 1995 to help us better understand and communicate with our customers, and today there are 19 million households in the UK with Clubcard. At the end of 2019, we launched the UK's first grocery loyalty subscription service, Clubcard Plus, giving customers even more value from their Tesco shop, including 10% off two big shops in-store each month. A new Clubcard New ways to shop From multipacks to multibuys Innovation. Simplify to serve As customer shopping habits continue to change, we are adapting the way we run our stores - improving customer service, and reducing our operating costs. In the UK, we have rolled out a new proposition for fresh food counters and in February we announced changes to the way we bake in our large stores, to better reflect customer demands. Plant-based food We have a market-leading range of plant-based foods, catering to a growing trend of veganism and flexitarian diets. In September 2019 we launched our new 'Plant Chef' range, and we continue to expand this - for example with the launch of the UK's first plant-based condiment range in January. Plastic packaging Our packaging strategy is based on '4 Rs': - Remove it where we can. This year, we committed to remove one billion pieces of plastic from our UK stores by the end of 2020, and are working with our suppliers to remove 67 million pieces of multipack plastic from cans in our stores, saving 350 tonnes of plastic each year. Simpler for colleagues All our large stores are using a new scheduler tool, providing greater flexibility and choice for colleagues. This simple technology enables us to reduce administration, making it simpler for colleagues to book and amend shifts, and feedback has been extremely positive. co. uk relaunch Booker already has a significant digital business, serving many thousands of customers online. These Booker customers will now benefit from the technology capability of Tesco, following a relaunch of Booker. There have already been improvements to web analytics and invoicing, making the order process simpler for Booker customers. A seamless store experience Different technologies work for different customers, so we will continue to offer a choice of ways to shop and pay. One area we are exploring is the use of new technology to make shopping 'frictionless': where items are automatically added to a digital shopping basket as customers pick them up from the shelf. We are testing this technology with colleagues in the Express store at our Welwyn Garden City campus. 5 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Strategic report We use our expertise to understand and meet our customers' needs better than anybody else.

To aid comparability, headline results and associated commentary is presented on a 52-week comparable basis. We have delivered a strong performance, significantly growing profitability and free cash flow. Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles of PS2,959m grew by 13.5%. Strong performance in our UK & ROI and Asia segments was partly offset by the impact of disruption as we transform our business in Central Europe to improve long-term profitability in the region. Retail free cash flow increased by PS1,174m year-on-year to PS2,063m, reflecting the strong increase in cash profitability, an improvement in working capital and the contribution from the sale of our share in our joint venture in China, Gain Land. Reflecting the strength of our performance last year and given our robust liquidity and balance sheet, we propose to pay a final dividend of 6.50 pence per ordinary share. This takes the total dividend for the year to 9.15 pence per ordinary share, up 58.6% year-on-year, including the payment of an interim dividend of 2.65 pence per ordinary share in November 2019. This represents a full-year dividend payout ratio of 50% on a 53-week basis. In March we announced that we had agreed to sell our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia to a combination of CP Group entities g, following inbound interest and a detailed strategic review. Consideration for the disposal represents an enterprise value of $10.6bn c. PS8.2bn on a cash and debt-free basis. Following completion of the disposal, we intend to return c. PS5bn to shareholders via a special dividend and further fide-risk the business by reducing indebtedness through a PS2.5bn pension contribution, which is expected to eliminate the funding deficit. a Last year figures restated for the adoption of IFRS 16 as explained in Note 1 and Note 37 to the Group financial statements. b Group sales exclude VAT and fuel. Sales growth shown on a comparable days basis for Central Europe and Asia. Booker consolidated from 5 March 2018 and therefore includes nine additional days in 2019 20 vs. 2018 19. The nine additional days of Booker sales in the current year contributed 0.2% to Group sales growth in the year. c Excludes amortisation of acquired intangibles and excludes exceptional items by virtue of their size and nature in order to reflect management's view of underlying performance. d Net debt and Retail free cash flow exclude the impact of Tesco Bank in order to provide further analysis of the Retail cash flow statement. Net debt also includes lease liabilities following the adoption of IFRS 16. Net debt excluding lease liabilities was PS 2.6 bn, down PS0.2bn year-on-year. e Headline 'diluted earnings per share' and 'adjusted Group profit before tax' measures exclude exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments. f Capex is shown excluding property buybacks. Statutory capital expenditure including property buybacks for the 53 weeks ended 29 February 2020 was PS2.1bn 2018 19: PS1.2bn. g On 9 March 2020 we announced the proposed sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia to a combination of CP Group entities. Completion of the disposal, which is conditional on shareholder approval and customary regulatory approvals in Thailand and Malaysia, is expected during the second half of 2020. Thailand and Malaysia will be treated as discontinued operations for the 2020 21 financial year. All guidance and forward-looking statements are on a continuing operations basis. 7 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Strategic report Financial review continued Segmental results. UK & ROI a In the UK, we continued our centenary celebrations offering significant savings to customers through our '100 Years of Great Value' events, and introduced exclusive Clubcard Prices for our 19 million Clubcard holders. We have further strengthened our value proposition with the launch of our 'Aldi Price Match campaign' in March 2020, price matching to Aldi on hundreds of Tesco and branded products. The customer reaction to the launch of Clubcard Plus in November has been encouraging. For a PS7.99 monthly subscription, customers can benefit from 10% off two big shops in-store as well as savings on popular Tesco brands and double data on Tesco Mobile. Subscribers can also apply for a Clubcard Plus credit card from Tesco Bank with no foreign exchange fees abroad b. Our fresh food volumes outperformed the market by 0.5% c supported by strong performance in our 'food-to-go' offer. We continue to improve our overall product mix, making our general merchandise offer more relevant by focusing on categories that are complementary to our food offer such as Home and Cook. In the coming year we are planning to rebalance space further, in particular by augmenting our F&F clothing offer in a number of our large stores. Our online grocery customer service ratings all improved year-on-year. Following a strong sales performance in the first half, a slower rate of growth in the second half of the year reflected our decision to maintain a sustainable approach to incentivising new customers in a highly competitive environment. We are taking steps to increase our online capacity to align to the long-term growth in customer demand in this channel, with our first urban fulfilment centre planned in our West Bromwich Extra store. This year we will also increase the number of vans and trial unmanned Click & Collect sites to further support order growth. In November we announced we will become the first UK retailer to remove plastic-wrapped tinned multipacks from all stores and replace them with plastic-free multibuys, eliminating 67 million pieces of plastic. This forms part of our commitment to remove one billion pieces of plastic from our UK stores by the end of 2020. Booker sales grew on a comparable days basis by 3.8% excluding tobacco 2.9% including tobacco despite a challenging market in both wholesale and retail, with small business confidence remaining low. The continued focus on customer service was recognised in November when Booker was named 'Best National Wholesaler' for overall customer satisfaction d. The acquisition of Best Food Logistics in early March 2020 will provide more customers with the benefits of the sourcing capabilities of the wider Tesco business. In ROI, sales grew by 0.8% at constant exchange rates, and we saw particularly strong sales growth in core fresh food, including bakery and produce, as customers responded well to the continued investment in our 'You won't pay more' value campaign. UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles grew by 16.9% at actual exchange rates to PS2,184m, with operating margin up 59 basis points year-on-year. The increase in profitability was driven by the actions we have taken to improve product mix, and cost savings through further refinements to our operating model including changes to our in-store counters offer and simplification of stock control processes. We have now delivered cumulative synergies comprising the in-year benefit of new initiatives combined with the carry forward of prior year activity of PS207m from the Booker merger, exceeding our c. PS200m target a year earlier than planned. While we still see many opportunities to deliver further synergies, these will no longer be considered separately to our overall UK & ROI performance. In the period, the challenge of a weak market in both the wholesale and catering sectors was exacerbated by the effect of the clearance of excess stock that had been built up in anticipation of Brexit disruption. Despite these challenges Booker's profit growth including synergies outperformed the industry as a whole. Central Europe e In Central Europe, we have undertaken a significant transformation, fundamentally changing our approach in Poland and resizing, simplifying and improving the relevance of our businesses in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. Sales fell by 10.1 % at constant exchange rates, reflecting disruption from the actions we have taken including the rationalisation of our general merchandise offer, making our customer offer more relevant and compelling. Across the region we rightsized 545 hypermarkets, closed 28 stores and, in Poland, completed the transition to a two-format model compact hypermarkets and supermarkets. We also invested to improve the shopping trip for customers, focusing on availability which improved by 1% and our key 'Star Lines' products which saw like-for-like growth of 20%. Operating profit before exceptional items in Central Europe was PS156m, 29.4 % lower year-on-year. The actions described above to simplify our operations resulted in significant sales disruption and stock clearance costs, particularly in the second half of the year. In addition, performance reflected investments to improve the competitiveness of our offer, in particular our key 'Star Lines' products, over 600 everyday items which we have made available to customers at market-leading prices. Excluding a PS 13 m provision made in the first half in respect of potential historical VAT liabilities, the change in operating profit was 23.5 %. Asia f In Asia, sales grew by 6.7% at actual exchange rates and by 0.1% at constant exchange rates. In Thailand, our new Express proposition roll out and large store reinvention programme are both progressing well and as part of our innovation in store formats we now have two of our 'ultra convenient' E-Pop stores in the Bangkok region. We have simplified our fresh food offer, with more competitive prices and our 'Food Love Stories' campaign has further improved customer quality perceptions. The simplification of our general merchandise ranges impacted our headline sales by c. 1 % in the year. In Malaysia, we increased our market share, opening two new small stores following favourable legislation changes, with plans for a further four openings in 2020 21. Across the region we are building trust with customers through our focus on reducing food waste and plastic usage. We saw a strong increase in profitability in Asia, with growth of 33.5% at actual exchange rates and 24.8% at constant exchange rates. We accelerated our cost savings initiatives in Thailand, including a more efficient distribution operation and more focused, more effective marketing activity. In addition, we benefited from the flow through of prior year initiatives. We continued to optimise the mix of our product ranges as we focus on sustainable, profitable ranges in general merchandise. Performance also included a PS24m benefit as a result of changes to how property tax is levied on businesses in Thailand. In 2020 21, our Asia operations will be treated as a discontinued operation following the announcement on 9 March 2020 of the proposed sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia g.

Tesco Bank sales were impacted by our decision to exit the mortgage market in September, which also drove the decline in lending to customers. The insurance market remains highly competitive and we continue to focus our investment on retention of existing customers. This year we have also invested in the customer experience through a number of initiatives, including the launch of the Clubcard Plus credit card, and a new Student Shopper a UK & ROI consists of Tesco UK, ROI and Booker.

In addition, we upgraded the Tesco Mobile app to allow customers to purchase foreign currency and we rolled out our Click & Collect service to more stores. Operating profit before exceptional items decreased by 3.0 % year-on-year to PS193m. Our insurance income decreased as we focused on competitive pricing, however we delivered increased income from our loans portfolio in line with increased lending to customers, and higher income from our gift cards and travel money. The significant cost savings made this year include lower fraud costs resulting from the Bank's continued focus on improved technology and safeguarding our customers, and lower ATM maintenance costs as a result of optimisation efficiencies. This has contributed to the cost:income ratio improving by 1.9% pts year-on-year. In February we stopped accepting new applications for personal current accounts, as part of our repositioning of Tesco Bank to focus on the right products and services for Tesco customers. This resulted in an exceptional charge of PS 56 m relating to accelerated depreciation of intangible and fixed assets.

This year, total exceptional items resulted in a net cost of PS 375 m, compared to a net credit of PS120m in the prior year. This year-on-year movement is principally due to provision releases and net impairment reversals in the base, as well as the accounting impact of obtaining full control of one of our property joint ventures The Tesco Atrato Limited Partnership through the acquisition of our partner's 50% stake in September 2019. All of these significant movements are non-cash. Exceptional restructuring and redundancy costs of PS 107 m include a PS 51 m charge relating to the simplification of our store operating model in the UK and a PS 43 m charge relating to the transformation we have undertaken in Central Europe. Exceptional net profits on property transactions of PS44m have arisen from property disposals within the UK PS18m and Central Europe PS26m. We have incurred a PS 23 m exceptional charge relating to Booker integration costs, bringing costs to date to PS 38 m. The acquisition of our partner's stake in The Tesco Atrato Limited Partnership results in the Group taking on the joint venture's external debt in addition to its freehold assets 15 stores and two distribution centres. The exceptional charge of PS 136 m represents the net effect of the derecognition of the previously held IFRS 16 lease liabilities and right of use assets, and the impairment of the acquired assets. As announced at the half year, the impairment charge of PS 47 m relating to our Trent Hypermarket joint venture relates to reduced profit expectations due to investments in the competitiveness of our offer and reduced store expansion plans. Other exceptional items include a profit of PS37m on the disposal of our 20% share in Gain Land in China, and a PS 22 m charge relating to corporate activity, which includes costs relating to the proposed sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia in addition to other Group projects. Tesco Bank recognised a PS 56 m exceptional accelerated depreciation charge following the decision to close our current account business to new customers. Also, as announced at the half year, Tesco Bank recognised an additional PS 45 m provision for customer redress due to an unexpectedly high number of claims received in the weeks prior to the 29 August deadline in respect of Payment Protection Insurance PPI. Net exceptional items of PS 33 m in week 53 comprise a PS 44 m charge relating to further changes to our UK store operating model and PS11m of net profits on property transactions in the UK. Amortisation of acquired intangible assets is also excluded from our headline performance measures. The PS 78 m charge primarily relates to our merger with Booker in March 2018, which resulted in the recognition of goodwill of PS3,093m and a PS755m intangible asset. Our share of post-tax profits from joint ventures and associates before exceptional items was PS26m, an increase of PS5m year-on-year primarily due to a reduced level of losses from Gain Land, our former associate in China. Exceptional items of PS 8 m comprise a PS 12 m charge for land penalties arising in our 20% share of Gain Land, and in Tesco Bank, an exceptional gain of PS4m in our insurance joint venture, Tesco Underwriting, reflecting a revision to the Ogden compensation tables which are used to calculate future losses in personal injury and fatal accident claims. Following the sale of our 20% share in Gain Land and proposed sale of our business in Thailand, which is inclusive of our 25% share of the Tesco Lotus Retail Growth Freehold and Leasehold Property Fund TLGF, our share of post-tax profits from joint ventures and associates will primarily relate to our UK property joint ventures. In 2019 20 TLGF contributed PS26m to profit.

Total indebtedness was PS 14,674 m, down PS868m year-on-year driven by a reduction in our lease liabilities and underlying net debt, partly offset by an increase in the pension deficit. Our lease liabilities decreased by PS943m year-on-year, principally reflecting the purchase of our partner's 50% stake in the Tesco Atrato Limited property joint venture. The acquisition, which is treated as an asset acquisition, increases our freehold property ownership and borrowings, replacing associated right of use assets and lease liabilities. In addition, our lease liabilities reduced due to capital repayments made in the year and the buyback of a number of other leasehold properties. On an IAS 19 basis, our pension deficit increased by PS 235 m to PS 2.6 bn. An increase in the measurement of scheme liabilities due to a fall in corporate bond yields was largely offset by strong asset performance, including that of our liability-driven investment portfolio, in addition to continued deficit contributions and the application of the latest actuarial assumptions. As part of the use of proceeds from the proposed sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, we have reached agreement with the Trustees to make a PS2.5bn one-off contribution into the Scheme. This, along with other measures, is expected to eliminate the funding deficit and significantly reduce the prospect of having to make further pension deficit contributions in the future. The agreement with the Trustees also covers the key principles of the triennial scheme valuation, which will now be calculated as at 31 December 2019. The Trustees will aim to conclude the valuation as soon as is reasonably possible. Our key credit metrics, which are Fixed charge cover and Total indebtedness EBITDA, have further improved since the end of the last financial year, from 3.0 to 3.4 times and from 3.6 to 3.1 times respectively. We are now targeting leverage of c. 2.5 times. Retail free cash flow increased by PS1,174m year-on-year to PS2,063m, reflecting a strong increase in cash profitability, a decrease in working capital and the contribution from the sale of our share in Gain Land. We generated a net working capital inflow of PS163m. This improvement is lower than initially planned, and includes the reversal of the PS 210 m impact seen in the second half of last year primarily relating to our decision to delay the implementation of a new general ledger system. Our planned progress was held back by the timing of non-trade related payments, the deleveraging effect of lower sales in Central Europe and the continued prioritisation of securing availability for customers ahead of potential Brexit deadlines. These factors were partly offset by a refinement of payment terms with our largest suppliers. The PS 240 m impact shown in the table overleaf in working capital relating to week 53 is primarily driven by the timing of a fuel payment. Cash capital expenditure was PS142m lower year-on-year as we maintain our disciplined approach to capital investment. An PS80m reduction in cash interest principally relates to debt maturities and bond tenders at a significantly lower rate of interest. Cash interest also includes the interest element of lease rental payments, which reduced by PS26m year-on-year as leases were utilised and we bought back a number of other leasehold properties. Retail cash tax paid in the year was PS271m, a decrease of PS31m year-on-year. The decrease year-on-year was due to IFRS 16 transitional adjustments and a higher charge for fair value remeasurements in the period, which are both eligible for cash tax relief. We generated PS258m of property proceeds including PS167m from the sale of properties in Central Europe, mainly in Poland. We utilised PS172m of cash primarily for the buyback of our Blandford, Chesterfield and High Wycombe stores, which will result in an annual cash rental saving of PS8m. Net finance costs before exceptional charges, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments reduced by PS76m year-on-year to PS 746 m, mainly driven by a reduction in net interest payable following debt maturities, bond tenders and new debt issued at a significantly lower rate of interest. In addition, finance charges payable on lease liabilities reduced by PS26m year-on-year due to ongoing lease utilisation and the buyback of 21 leasehold properties in the year. Fair value remeasurements of financial instruments increased by PS73m year-on-year driven by a fall in inflation expectations impacting the new index-linked swaps, which offset those put in place as part of historical sale and leaseback property transactions. The swaps were restructured to eliminate the impact of future inflation on the Group's cash flow in relation to these property transactions. Fair value remeasurements also includes PS 65 m primarily relating to the premium paid on the repurchase on long-dated bonds last year: PS 121 m. Net pension finance costs decreased by PS18m year-on-year, primarily due to a lower opening pension deficit. For the 2020 21 financial year, net pension finance costs are expected to be no more than c. PS55m. The exact cost will depend on the timing of the one-off pension contribution of PS2.5bn, described overleaf. The exceptional charge of PS 180 m included in net finance costs relates to actions taken to remove inflation risk from the historical sale and leaseback property transactions. The charge, which is non-cash, relates to the revaluation of credit risk associated with the historical swaps, described above, over a shorter timeframe. An exceptional credit of PS29m relates to a fair value remeasurement as part of the sale of Tesco Bank's mortgage book that was completed in September. Group tax Tax on Group profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was PS 430 m, PS33m higher than last year due to increased profitability. This year's charge also includes a credit arising from closing a number of issues relating to prior years across the Group. Group cash tax paid in the year was PS340m, including PS207m of corporate tax paid in the UK. Following the reversal of the enacted 2% reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax from 1 April 2020, we now expect the Group's effective tax rate to be around 21% in the medium term. For the 2020 21 financial year we expect an effective tax rate of c. 24% as a result of a one-off rate change impact from revaluing deferred tax from 17% to 19%. As previously announced, following changes to the timing of UK corporation tax payments, in common with other large UK companies we will have two additional quarterly cash payments in the 2021 fiscal year. This change effectively moves from payment of around half the tax liability after the financial year end to full payment in-year, and is expected to create a one-off additional cash outflow in the first half of our 2020 21 financial year. As part of the use of proceeds from the proposed sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, we intend to make a PS2.5bn one-off contribution into the UK defined benefit pension scheme. As the Group will receive tax relief on this contribution, it is anticipated that the level of cash tax payable will be reduced by c. PS120m in the year of payment and c. PS60m per annum in the following three years. On a statutory 53-week basis, the total tax charge is PS 380 m which includes a PS53m credit relating to exceptional items. Earnings per share This year 53-week basis Exclude week 53 This year 52-week basis Last year Diluted EPS pre-exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments 18.23p 0.31 p 17.92p 14.01p Statutory diluted earnings per share 9.54p - n a 13.04p Statutory basic earnings per share 9.60p - n a 13.13p Our diluted earnings per share before exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments was 17.92p, 27.9% higher year-on-year, due to our improved profit performance. Statutory basic earnings per share from continuing operations were 9.60p, 26.9 % lower year-on-year, primarily reflecting the change in the level of exceptional items year-on-year. 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 We purchased PS149m of shares in the market following our commitment to offset any dilution from the issuance of new shares to satisfy the requirements of share schemes. Going forward we continue to expect to utilise c. PS150m a year, with the precise amount depending on performance and market conditions. The increase in repayments of obligations under leases of PS27m is largely offset by a corresponding decrease within the interest element of lease rental payments included in net interest. As previously announced, we will make a PS0.3bn pension deficit contribution in the 2020 21 financial year, which in addition to the proposed one-off PS2.5bn contribution in the second half of 2020, is expected to eliminate the funding deficit and significantly reduce the prospect of having to make further deficit contributions in the future, releasing c. PS260m of annual free cash flow.

Our capital expenditure for the year was PS1.1bn, broadly level on the prior year, and was primarily focused on store maintenance and refits. In the UK & ROI spend has related to the maintenance of our stores in addition to 18 new Express store openings and our temporary replacement store in Kennington. We also opened five Jack's stores in the UK, bringing the total to 12. In Central Europe, our programme to address unproductive selling space by either refitting, downsizing or repurposing stores is now largely complete. In Poland we moved to a two-format model, which involved closing or resizing all hypermarkets to our better performing compact hypermarket format. The total space reduction in Central Europe was c. 3 million sq. In Asia we opened two new stores in Malaysia, following favourable legislation changes and a further 54 new stores in Thailand, primarily in our Express format. Following the proposed sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, in future years we expect our annual Group capital expenditure to be within a range of PS0.9bn to PS1.2bn. Statutory capital expenditure of PS2.1bn includes PS914m relating to the acquisition of full control of the The Tesco Atrato Limited Partnership comprising 15 stores and two distribution centres and PS136m relating to the buyback of a number of other leasehold properties in the year. This year Last year UK & ROI PS769m PS709m Central Europe PS108m PS130m Asia PS134m PS235m Tesco Bank PS52m PS31m Group PS1,063m PS1,105m Property. The estimated market value of our fully owned property as at the year end increased by PS0.4bn to PS21.7bn. The market value of PS21.7bn represents a surplus of PS2.8bn over the net book value. Our Group freehold property ownership percentage, by value, has increased by 2% year-on-year. In September we completed the purchase of our partner's 50% stake in The Tesco Atrato Limited Partnership property joint venture, which includes 15 stores and two distribution centres. This asset acquisition increased our percentage of fully owned property in UK & ROI by c. 2% and will lead to an annualised cash rental saving of PS41m. The repurchase of three large stores in the UK also supported an improvement in the percentage of fully-owned property, in addition to an annualised cash rental saving of PS8m. Reflecting the strength of our performance last year and given our robust liquidity and balance sheet, we propose to pay a final dividend of 6.50 pence per Ordinary share. This takes the total dividend for the year to 9.15 pence per Ordinary share, up 58.6% year-on-year, including the payment of an interim dividend of 2.65 pence per Ordinary share in November 2019. We expect to maintain a full-year dividend payout ratio of 50% going forward and from 2020 21 our interim dividend will be set at 35% of the prior year full-year dividend. The proposed final dividend was approved by the Board of Directors on 7 April 2020 and is subject to the approval of shareholders at this year's AGM. The final dividend will be paid on 3 July 2020 to shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on 22 May 2020 the Record Date. Shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividend in the dividend reinvestment plan DRIP. The last date for receipt of DRIP elections and revocations will be 12 June 2020. COVID-19 is having a material impact on the operations of our business and we are incurring significant additional costs, particularly in payroll as we recruit additional colleagues to meet demand and cover the work of those colleagues who are absent and being paid. While the full financial impact of the crisis for 2020 21 is impossible to predict with a high degree of certainty, we have considered a range of scenarios to understand potential outcomes on our business and plan appropriately. Dependent on the scenario, the estimated impact on our retail cost lines is between c. PS 650 m and c. PS 925 m including significant cost increases in payroll, distribution and store expenses. At this stage it would not be prudent to provide financial guidance for 2020 21, however if customer behaviour were to return to normal by August it is likely that the additional cost headwinds incurred in our retail operations would be largely offset by the benefits of food volume increases, 12 months' business rates relief in the UK and prudent operations management. Tesco Bank, which operates as a standalone regulated entity, is expected to be impacted by a reduction in income from all of its activities, including credit cards, loans and travel money. This expected decrease in income, in addition to provisions for potential bad debts, is likely to result in a loss for the Bank in the year ending February 2021. Notwithstanding this, the Bank's capital ratios Tier 1 ratio: 20.6% and Total ratio: 23.1% as at 29 February 2020 and liquidity are expected to remain strong. 11 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Strategic report Key performance indicators Our Big 6 KPIs.

The plan delivers the Group's purpose of 'serving shoppers a little better every day' and is underpinned by a clear strategic focus on driving sustainable and profitable growth through innovation and technology. The Group conducts an annual strategic planning process, comprising a comprehensive reassessment of progress against the Group's strategic objectives alongside a careful evaluation of the longer-term opportunities and risks in each market in which the Group operates. The process for assessing the principal and emerging risks in each market is an important input to this process. The Group's strategic planning and viability statement are considered over a three-year period, as this horizon most appropriately reflects the dynamic and changing retail environment in which the Group operates. Long-term planning process The long-term planning process builds from the Group's current position and considers the evolution of the strategic objectives over the next three years. As part of this process, a longer-term assessment of the prospects of the Group is also considered. Current position The Group has delivered on every part of the turnaround plan outlined in 2016 and continues the transformation of the business at pace, supported by: - A strategic focus on driving growth across the Group through innovation and technology. - A clear set of financial priorities to deliver cash profit, free cash flow and earnings per share growth, underpinned by a robust capital allocation framework. - A diversified portfolio of businesses covering retail, wholesaling, banking and data science. Refer to the Group Chief Executive's review on page 3 and the Financial review from page 7 for further detail regarding the Group's strategic and financial progress. Longer-term prospects The following factors are considered both in the formulation of the Group's strategic plan, and in the longer-term assessment of the Group's prospects: - The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, as well as emerging risks as they are identified such as climate change, and the Group's response to these. - The prevailing economic climate and global economy, competitor activity, market dynamics and changing customer behaviours. - The potential shortand longer-term economic impact of Brexit. - How the Group can best position itself to take advantage of the rapidly evolving retail market and structural shifts in how customers shop. - Opportunities for further cost reduction through operational simplification and leveraging technology. - The resilience afforded by the Group's operational scale. Assessing the Group's viability The viability of the Group has been assessed, taking into account the Group's current financial position, including external funding in place over the assessment period, and after modelling the impact of certain scenarios arising from the Group's principal risks outlined on pages 13 to 18. Four 'severe but plausible' scenarios have been modelled that address the principal risks that the Group has assessed would have the most direct and material impact on the Group. None of these scenarios, either individually or in aggregate threaten the viability of the Company. Scenario Associated principal risks Description Competitive pressure - Brand, reputation and trust - Competition and markets - Customer Failure to respond to fierce competition and changes in the retail market drive sustained like-for-like volume decline in core food categories with no offsetting price inflation, putting pressure on margins. Scenario Associated principal risks Description Data security or regulatory breach - Brand, reputation and trust - Data security and data privacy - Political, regulatory and compliance A serious data security or regulatory breach results in a significant monetary penalty, and a loss of customer reputation. The modelling of this scenario is approached via a 'reverse-stress test' given the inherent uncertainty of value. This assesses the risk in the context of the residual headroom after all other downside scenarios have been applied. Brexit impact - Competition and markets - Political, regulatory and compliance - Brexit Assumes a no-deal Brexit scenario which results in an increase to cost of goods sold. A broad assessment of the potential impact has been modelled including: higher import tariffs, higher sourcing costs from a weaker Sterling, higher labour costs and the potential cost of customs friction from border controls. Appropriate mitigation options open to the Group have also been considered within this scenario. Reduction in cost savings and cash generation - Transformation - Liquidity Failure to achieve the Group's transformation objectives resulting in an inability to progress sufficiently quickly to maintain or increase operating margin and generate sufficient cash to meet business objectives. Impact of COVID-19 - COVID-19 - Liquidity - Tesco Bank Assumes a 12-week lockdown and phased recovery. A broad assessment of the financial impact has been modelled including the impact on sales, margin and operating costs. In modelling the scenario, the Group has considered the potential impact on retail, catering and wholesale sales, the cost implications of the operational actions being taken to continue to serve customers, together with the impact of reduced income from the mall businesses in Central Europe and Asia. The Bank has modelled an economic downturn scenario from the impact of COVID-19 in relation to the expected credit losses on its lending book. The Bank has sourced updated macroeconomic projections from a third-party provider and has used this modelling to assess the adequacy of capital and liquidity in place to support the business through the expected economic downturn. These scenarios assumed that external debt is repaid as it becomes due and committed facilities renewed as they become due. The scenarios above are hypothetical and purposefully severe with the aim of creating outcomes that have the ability to threaten the viability of the Group. In the case of these scenarios arising, various options are available to the Group in order to maintain liquidity so as to continue in operation such as: i accessing new external funding early: ii more radical short-term cost reduction actions: and iii reducing capital expenditure. None of these actions are assumed in our current scenario modelling. Viability statement Based on these severe but plausible scenarios, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period considered. Longer-term viability statement 19 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Strategic report In June 2017 Tesco publicly committed to implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD. We recognise climate change as the biggest environmental threat the world faces, and one which poses particular challenges to our business including our supply chain and operations. Conversely, effectively responding to climate change can enhance our business resilience and enable us to take advantage of any opportunities it may offer. Our first TCFD scenario analyses were conducted in the financial year 2018 19, assessing the UK business - our biggest market. We prioritised produce, animal protein categories as well as our UK estate. Produce and animal protein are key commercial categories, with supply chains around the world. We assessed the risks and opportunities we may face in 2030 under two climate scenarios: a 'Pessimistic' scenario and an 'Optimistic' scenario. The 'Pessimistic' scenario is where the world fails to address climate change, leading to global temperatures continuing to rise well above 2 degrees. This scenario assumes limited policy or regulatory support and looks at physical climate risks. The 'Optimistic' scenario is where the world rises to the challenge of tackling climate change and limits global warming to well below 2 degrees. This low-carbon transition scenario centres on the rapid changes that will be needed by 2030 to cut emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. Our scenarios are based on those developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Our scenario analyses assessed Tesco's exposure to physical climate risks such as rising temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns and extreme weather events. Beyond physical risks, we also assessed risks and opportunities arising from a transition to a low-carbon world aligned with the Paris Agreement. These transition risks are a result of market and societal shifts related to agriculture, diets and energy use. For produce, we focused on agricultural production by country and product. Our assessments indicate some physical risks and opportunities to our produce supply chain. For animal protein, our assessment focused on milk, beef, lamb and chicken. The assessment shows transition risks and opportunities arising from potential policy and societal shifts. To assess climate risks on our property estate, we assessed how our stores and distribution centres might fare under these scenarios. Produce The results of our risk assessment indicate physical risks as well as unrealised opportunities to our produce supply chain. For example, long-term changes in temperature and rainfall patterns chronic climate change will adversely impact production by 2030. The countries most impacted will be South Africa, Egypt, Spain and Peru. In the UK, our analysis shows that higher temperatures and rainfall by 2030 can support a longer growing season. This can potentially increase yield for certain crops if other growing conditions such as land availability and soil fertility are also favourable. We are currently sharing these results with our supply partners and working with those in the impacted areas to conduct more detailed scenario analyses and mitigation planning. Protein The results of our scenario analysis show transition risks to our protein supply chain. These include societal dietary shifts away from animal protein as well as potential new policies aimed at keeping global temperature rises well below 2 degrees. Opportunities identified include projected growth in plant-based food and meat alternatives. Working with our key suppliers, we are expanding our plant-based ranges, addressing the climate impacts of livestock farming as well as supporting effective climate policy development. UK property Our scenario analysis of climate risks facing our UK estate shows both physical and transition climate risks. For example, some of our stores and distribution centres, especially those in the South East region, will face an increased risk of flooding as a result of climate change. Effective policies to address carbon emissions from energy could increase our compliance costs. These results are informing our risk management and business continuity plans. Our renewable electricity transition plan forms part of our mitigation plan, enabling us to switch to onsite renewable electricity generation as well as long-term power purchase agreements which provide price stability and limit our exposure to high carbon prices. Our LHP outlines our climate change commitments, both for our own operations and our supply chain. The Corporate Responsibility Committee is responsible for climate change as part of the LHP. The Committee meets three times during the year and receives regular updates on our LHP commitments and performance. This year, results of the TCFD analysis were presented to the Executive Committee and the Corporate Responsibility Committee. Climate risks were also evaluated at the Audit Committee as part of the overall risk framework. The identification and management of climate-related risks follow our established risk management process. Key elements of the risk management process are set out on page 13. Following our assessment of emerging risks, climate change has been highlighted and is considered an integral part of both the responsible sourcing and supply chain, and the brand, reputation and trust principal risks on pages 17 and 15. Principal risks are monitored by the Audit Committee to ensure effective management and mitigation through our policies, processes, practices and performance. In May 2017, Tesco announced new science-based climate targets for our own operations and supply chain. Our own operations targets are aligned with the Paris Agreement's aspiration to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. We are on track to reduce absolute carbon emissions from our operations from 2015 16 levels by 35% by 2020, 60% by 2025 and 100% by 2050. To help us meet these targets, we have committed to source 100% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Our science-based climate change targets for our supply chain includes explicit targets for manufacturing and agricultural suppliers - recognising the different approaches required to reduce emissions in both areas. Our climate change metrics and targets are disclosed in the full LHP report available on our website. We aim to conduct climate risks assessments for all relevant parts of our business. In 2020 21, we will expand our assessment to the grocery and prepared foods categories as well as soy - a key commodity in animal feed. The results of this assessment will be reported in next year's Annual Report.

Everything we do is driven by our purpose to serve shoppers a little better every day. That means we try to get each of the 80 million weekly transactions in store right, every time, for every customer. It also means taking actions today to ensure we serve tomorrow's shoppers equally well. For 100 years, Tesco has provided affordable, quality food to customers from all walks of life and we know that to continue doing so for the next 100 years, we must continue to embrace sustainable production and consumption behaviours while adapting to the changing world around us. Our Little Helps Plan helps us to navigate our way forward, focusing on areas where we can make a big difference while supporting our values: - No one tries harder for customers shapes our belief that it's our responsibility to make the right calls on behalf of our customers: - We treat people how they want to be treated drives how we work with suppliers, partners, colleagues and communities: and - Every little help makes a big difference captures our belief that everyone at Tesco has a role to play. This encapsulates our ambition to make a positive difference. com sustainability to learn more about our activities and progress. Our Little Helps Plan helps us navigate some of the biggest challenges facing the world today. Further information about the governance of the Little Helps Plan and a full review of our activity and performance against our KPIs can be found on our website and within the comprehensive Little Helps Plan Report available online. Our Little Helps Plan is the framework through which we shape our long-term approach to sustainability and enables us to demonstrate, monitor and improve our performance, both within our own operations and the wider supply chain. The Plan focuses on the aspects of sustainability that are most relevant for Tesco and our stakeholders and demonstrates the positive contribution we make toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals SDGs by measuring our impacts, targeting our responses and framing our collaboration with key stakeholders to scale our efforts. This year we have refreshed the framework. After incorporating stakeholder feedback and external trends, we have integrated our previous foundation areas under the existing three pillars while creating a fourth pillar - Planet. This new pillar provides a platform for the work we're doing to address important environmental issues such as climate change, deforestation and sustainable agriculture. Our Code of Business Conduct underpins everything we do to ensure we remain a responsible, safe, ethical business both within our own operations and across our global supply chain. 21 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Strategic report Little Helps Plan continued Our Product pillar focuses on addressing issues related to health, food waste, packaging and animal welfare as we strive to provide affordable, sustainable, healthy products while ensuring that we never compromise on product safety. At Tesco, we have no time for waste and we have committed to help halve food waste from farm to fork in each of the markets in which we operate in line with UN SDG Target 12.3. We publish our food waste data for every market in the Group. Our target is that no food that is safe for human consumption will be wasted in our UK retail operations. Over the course of this year, we have reached 77% of our target as we have embedded new processes to ensure our progress is sustainable. Our customers, colleagues and those within our supply chain are vital to our continued success. As an employer of choice, we remain committed to treating people how they want to be treated and giving everyone the opportunity to get on. Our latest gender pay gap report can be found on our website. Decent, fair, safe work for all. With more than 400,000 colleagues around the world and millions of people who work within our supply chain, we are committed to promoting human rights and seek to ensure that there is decent, fair, safe work for all. Health and safety is central to how we do business and we are committed to our vision that no one should ever be hurt while working or shopping at Tesco. We have seen a 17% reduction in our injury volume year-on-year in our UK, Republic of Ireland and Central Europe businesses. Our accident frequency rate has also reduced by 7%. This has been primarily driven by continued efforts to strengthen our operating routines and an unrelenting focus on safe colleague behaviour as a culture across Tesco. The world of work is changing and preparing colleagues with the skills needed for the future is a top priority. This year we have continued to invest in digital skills for colleagues. Across the UK, Central Europe and Asia, our digital champions have delivered over 90,000 learning opportunities to improve the digital confidence of colleagues, and in India we have helped develop more than 200 colleagues in leading on automation and continuous improvement. Other key priorities for this year included developing diverse talent and building diversity and inclusion capability across all levels of the business. We continued to build an understanding of diversity and inclusion among colleagues and leaders through the introduction of digital learning and have leveraged our colleague networks to help inform the agenda. This includes making commitments to the Race at Work Charter and The Valuable 500. We'five also renewed our colleague engagement approach through the launch of our Every Voice Matters programme, which will help give more timely and responsive insight into how our colleagues are feeling across the Group and enable us to drive more focused action. Beyond our own colleagues, our human rights strategy focuses on four priority areas within our supply chain: sustainable livelihoods, forced labour, worker representation and gender equality. We support our suppliers to comply with the Ethical Trade Initiative ETI Base Code and undertake due diligence to help them meet our standards on human rights. This year 97% of critical non-conformances identified at our tier 1 suppliers were remediated on time and we continue to work with the remaining 3% to resolve these issues. In December 2019, a UK customer found a handwritten message within a Christmas card we sold reading 'please help us and notify human rights organisation'. We immediately launched an investigation and removed the cards from sale. While we did not find evidence of prison labour, we found other issues of concern that had regrettably not been identified by the independent auditor who had visited the previous month. We ceased working with the factory and supplier and have since reviewed our whole supply base for cards. Further information is provided in our Modern Slavery Statement available on our website.

Packaging: Remove, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. We are committed to only using packaging where it serves a purpose. This year in the UK we announced our Remove, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle plan to deliver our goals. Since 2018, we have removed over 10,000 tonnes of hard-to-recycle packaging from our Own Brand products and we pledged to remove one billion pieces of plastic from products for sale in UK stores by the end of 2020. In January we announced the elimination of 350 tonnes of plastic wrap from 67 million tinned food multipacks. We continually adjust the recipes of our Own Brand products to help customers lead healthier lives and respond to changing dietary preferences. In 2019, we more than doubled the range of our exclusive plant-based range Wicked Kitchen and also launched new products within our Tesco branded range, Plant Chef. We now have over 300 lines of targeted plant-based products. As a Peas Please Pledger and a supporter of Veg Power, we are committed to increasing vegetable consumption and 42% of our chilled and frozen ready meals now contribute at least 1 of 5 a day, up from 26% in 2018. Our long-term success depends on the health of the natural environment. The climate crisis, global biodiversity loss and the inefficient way in which resources are consumed present a real threat to our ability to provide customers with affordable, healthy, sustainable food. Details on our carbon strategy are provided on page 67 and our response to the recommendations of TCFD can be found on page 20. Halving the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket. In 2018, we launched our ground-breaking partnership with WWF to make it easier for customers to buy affordable, healthy, sustainable food. This year we jointly launched the Sustainable Basket Metric, which will help us track our progress in halving the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket against seven key sustainability issues.

In discharging our section 172 duty, we have regard for these factors taking them into consideration when decisions are made. Examples of how the Directors have oversight of stakeholder matters and had regard for these matters when making decisions are set out on pages 40 to 43. This Strategic report, including the non-financial reporting statement below, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, has been approved and signed on behalf of the Board. We are proud to be a valued member of thousands of communities around the world, and we are passionate about playing an active role in helping these communities thrive - from the jobs we provide to the good causes we support. This year, across the Group, we have donated PS98m to good causes through our charity partnerships, community grant programmes and colleague and customer fundraising. We continued to support our three national health charity partners: Cancer Research UK, Diabetes UK and the British Heart Foundation with the aim of lowering the risk of heart and circulatory disease, cancer and Type 2 diabetes. In the UK this year, we raised over PS6.6m through store events, donations and fundraising activity. A showcase moment was almost 5,000 people taking part in our biggest fundraising event Dance Beats - the longest dance marathon relay ever at Wembley Stadium, 30 hours of continuous dancing to claim the GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS r and donate PS2m to our charity partners. Beyond our corporate charity partners, we also continued to support local community groups with our Bags of Help scheme in the UK, Community Fund initiative in Ireland and our You Choose, We Help programme in Central Europe, allowing customers to Places. Robert Welch Group Company Secretary 7 April 2020 decide which local projects receive funding. To celebrate our 100th birthday, this year we introduced increased funding for larger projects with our Bags of Help Centenary grants in England, Scotland and Wales and, in Northern Ireland, our Tesco Centenary Fund. We announced that we will be introducing Bags of Help in Northern Ireland in 2020. This dedicated grant will see community groups share more than PS125,000 across the year. One of our important commitments is that no food that is safe for human consumption will be wasted in our UK retail operations. In support of that commitment, we continued our work with FareShare to donate surplus food from our stores through Community Food Connection. Since 2016 we have donated over 48 million meals to people in crisis through this initiative in the UK. We now run surplus food donation programmes in all the markets in which we operate. Our Tesco Food Collection programme encourages customers to donate long-life food to our charity partners, The Trussell Trust, who have a network of over 400 foodbanks, and FareShare, who redistribute surplus food to a network of charities including homeless hostels, women's refuges and breakfast clubs. 23 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Strategic report - Group strategy, operating plans, long-term plans and budget: - Changes to corporate and capital structure: - Major acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures and disposals: - Significant capital expenditure and borrowing: - Material contracts: - Risk management and internal control: - Changes to pension scheme: - Financial reporting and disclosures: - Review of remuneration policies and share schemes: and - Dividend policy and payment. The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the Group ensuring that it operates within a framework of effective controls. The Board is responsible for setting the overall strategy of the Group ensuring that value is created over the long-term. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board of those matters that are considered of significance to the Group owing to their strategic, financial or reputational importance. Further details are set out below. The Board has a detailed programme that ensures operational and financial performance, risk, governance, strategy, culture and stakeholder engagement are discussed at the appropriate time. At Board meetings, Directors receive and consider papers and presentations from the Executive Directors, senior management and subject-matter experts. The Board challenges management to ensure that the flow and quality of information to the Board is of a high standard. A review and refresh of Board and Committee papers was undertaken during the year to ensure that high-quality, clear and timely information is provided to Directors supporting the Board in its decision-making process. In the rare event of a Director being unable to attend a meeting, the Chair of the respective meeting discusses the matters proposed with the Director concerned wherever possible, seeking their support and feedback accordingly. The Chair subsequently represents those views at the meeting. The operations of the Board are underpinned by the collective experience of the Directors and the diverse skills and experience which they possess. These ensure that leadership and decisionmaking is focused and balanced, and is approached with independent thought and judgement. With the relationship between the Directors being one of trust and mutual respect, open and frank conversations ensure that even the most challenging decisions are taken for the benefit of the Company as a whole, with due consideration for all stakeholders who may be affected. Role statements set out the division of responsibilities between the Chairman and Group Chief Executive as well as the responsibilities of the Senior Independent Director and Non-executive Directors ensuring challenge, debate and an independent and objective mindset. Chairman The Chairman is responsible for effective leadership of the Board and maintaining a culture of openness and transparency at Board meetings. The Chairman promotes the effective communication between Executive and Non-executive Directors and ensures all Directors effectively contribute to discussions and feel comfortable in engaging in healthy debate and constructive challenge. The Chairman ensures all Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information to assist them to make their decisions, identifies training and development needs as required, and ensures appropriately tailored induction programmes are delivered for new Directors. Group Chief Executive The Group Chief Executive has day-to-day responsibility for the effective management of the Group's business and for ensuring that Board decisions are implemented. He plays a key role in devising and reviewing Group strategies for discussion and approval by the Board. The Group Chief Executive is tasked with providing regular operational updates to the Board on all matters of significance relating to the Group's business or reputation and for ensuring effective communication with shareholders and other key stakeholders. Senior Independent Director The Senior Independent Director provides a sounding board for the Chairman and acts as an intermediary for the Non-executive Directors, where necessary, and is available to shareholders should they have any concerns where communication through normal channels has not been successful or where such channels are inappropriate. The Senior Independent Director meets with the Non-executive Directors at least annually when leading the Non-executive Directors appraisal of the performance of the Chairman. Non-executive Directors The Non-executive Directors bring insight and experience to the Board. They have responsibility for constructively challenging the strategies proposed by the Executive Directors, scrutinising the performance of management in achieving agreed goals and objectives and play leading roles in the functioning of the Board Committees, bringing an independent view to the discussion. They meet with the Senior Independent Director to review the Chairman's performance and other matters. Group Company Secretary The Group Company Secretary is secretary to the Board. His responsibilities include ensuring the Board has the information, time and resources it needs in order to discharge its duties and function effectively and efficiently. The schedule of matters reserved for the Board can be found at www. Summary of matters reserved for the Board. 33 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Corporate governance The Group Company Secretary advises the Board on all governance matters and facilitates induction programmes for new Directors and provides briefings and guidance on governance, legal and regulatory matters. The appointment and removal of the Group Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board as a whole. Regular Board and Committee meetings are scheduled throughout the year ensuring that Directors allocate sufficient time to discharge their duties effectively. During the year, the Board held six scheduled meetings and additional strategy and planning days, which included presentations by senior management on each of the business areas. In addition to scheduled meetings, the Board held additional meetings to consider matters of a time-sensitive nature, including the proposed sale of the Thailand and Malaysia businesses. Directors are expected to attend all Board and relevant Committee meetings. The table on page 30 shows the record of attendance at the scheduled Board and Committee meetings. The nature of the Non-executive Director role makes it impossible to be specific about the maximum time commitment. However, it is anticipated that at least 20 days per annum after the induction phase is required plus additional time to devote to preparation ahead of each meeting. Directors are also required to regularly update and refresh their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the Company. It is recognised that at certain times it may be necessary to convene additional Board, Committee or shareholder meetings. Prior to appointment, the Nominations and Governance Committee assesses the commitments of a proposed candidate, including other directorships, to ensure they have sufficient time to devote to the role. Thereafter, the Committee regularly assesses the time commitments of Directors to ensure that they each continue to have sufficient time for their role. This assessment takes into account the number of external commitments each Director has and considers the potential additional time required in the event of corporate stress. Directors obtain approval prior to undertaking additional external appointments. Directors are required to report actual or potential conflicts of interest to the Board for consideration and, if appropriate, authorisation. If such conflicts exist, Directors excuse themselves from consideration of the relevant matter. The Company maintains a register of authorised conflicts of interest which is reviewed annually by the Nominations and Governance Committee. Details of the Directors' service contracts and terms of appointment, together with their interests in the Company's shares, are shown in the Directors' remuneration report on pages 52 to 64. If Directors have concerns about the Company or a proposed action which cannot be resolved, it is recorded in the Board minutes. Upon resignation, Directors are encouraged to provide a written statement of any concerns for consideration by the Board. No such concerns were raised in 2019 20 and up to the date of this report. All Directors have access to the advice of the Group Company Secretary and, in appropriate circumstances, may obtain independent professional advice at the Company's expense. No such requests were made in 2019 20. A Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance policy is maintained for all Directors and each Director has the benefit of a Deed of Indemnity. The Board is supported by the activities of each of the Board Committees which ensure the right level of attention and consideration are given to specific matters.

Corporate governance report continued Division of responsibilities continued Operations of the Board continued 34 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Having an effective corporate governance framework supports the Board in the delivery of the Group's strategy and supports long-term sustainable growth. Through matters reserved for the Board, Committee terms of reference and a robust delegated authority framework, it sets out how the business is managed and ensures effective and efficient decision-making through defined authority levels. Efficient internal reporting, internal controls and oversight of current and emerging risks are embedded into our business processes which align to the Group's strategy, purpose and values. The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to four key Board Committees which are each chaired by an Independent Non-executive Director, focusing on specific areas of the Board's responsibilities. The composition of each Committee is reviewed by the Nominations and Governance Committee annually and also at the time of any Board changes. Cross-Committee membership provides visibility and awareness of matters relevant between the Committees. Each Committee Chair provides a written and verbal report on Committee activities to the Board after each Committee meeting and Committee papers and minutes are shared with all Directors. The Board delegates responsibility for the day-to-day operational management of the Company to the Group Chief Executive, who is supported by the Executive Committee, Group Risk and Compliance Committee and other committees. When the need arises, a standing Disclosure Committee is convened to consider timely and accurate disclosure of sensitive information and the Board has agreed a Delegation of Authority. Matters considered by each of the Committees are set out in the Committee terms of reference which can be found at www. Having a diverse Board with different perspectives, insights and viewpoints benefits the Group's stakeholders through better business performance.

The Board sets the tone for inclusion and diversity across the Group and believes it is important to have an appropriate balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity on the Board and at senior management level to ensure good decision-making. It recognises the need to create conditions that foster talent and encourage all colleagues to achieve their full potential. To this end, we are committed to providing an inclusive working environment where difference is embraced and valued, as evidenced by our commitment to the Race at Work Charter. More detail on the Group's employment policies are set out in the Directors' report on pages 65 to 66. The Board, Nominations and Governance Committee, and Executive Committee receive regular updates on the progress of diversity and inclusion initiatives across the Group, with the goal of ensuring all colleagues have an opportunity to get on, developing the skills they need for now and the future, whoever they are, wherever they work and whatever they do. The Board has adopted a Board diversity and inclusion policy which sets out its approach to diversity and inclusion on the Board. This policy sits alongside the Company's equal opportunities and diversity policy, which sets out the Group's wider commitment to diversity and inclusion across Tesco. More information on the implementation of the Board diversity and inclusion policy can be found in the Nominations and Governance Committee report on pages 38 to 39. The policy can be found on the Company's website at www. 35 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Corporate governance Board expertise. The Board's skills matrix supports our approach to diversity by mapping the broad diversity of the Board in regard to gender, ethnicity, geographical expertise, professional background, tenure, age and other distinctions between Directors, linking these to our strategy. This enables the Board to develop a refreshment and succession plan for Non-executive Directors that meets the future needs of the Group. This is vital for bringing the expertise required and enabling different perspectives, insights and viewpoints to be brought to Board and Committee meetings. As set out in their biographies on pages 27 to 30, each member of the Board offers a range of core skills and experience that is relevant to the successful operation of the Group, while providing a strong independent element to the Board and a solid foundation for good corporate governance, fulfilling the vital role of corporate accountability. The oversight each of the Directors provides is balanced with individuals contributing a broad range of skills, diverse experience and knowledge, demonstrating independence and constructive challenge. The Nominations and Governance Committee considers whether each of the Non-executive Directors continues to be independent in character and judgement in line with the definition set out in the Code. For more information on the conclusion of the review undertaken by the Committee see pages 38 to 39. The Non-executive Directors met with the Chairman without the Executive Directors being present on a number of occasions and, at least annually, Directors meet with the Senior Independent Director to review the Chairman's performance and other matters. Non-executive Directors are initially appointed for a three-year term with an expectation that they will continue for at least a further three years. Directors are nominated by the Nominations and Governance Committee and are subsequently approved by the Board for election or re-election annually by shareholders at the Company's AGM. After three years' service the performance of a Non-executive Director is rigorously assessed by the Nominations and Governance Committee. Any development needs identified are discussed by the Chairman with the Non-executive Director. All Directors will submit themselves for election or re-election at the forthcoming AGM in June 2020. Detailed information on the contribution that each of the Directors brings to the Board is set out in the Board biographies on pages 27 to 30 and in the 2020 Notice of Annual General Meeting. Upon appointment, all new Directors receive a comprehensive induction programme over a number of months which is designed to facilitate their understanding of the business and is tailored to their individual needs. The Chairman and the Group Company Secretary are responsible for delivering the programme covering the Company's core purpose and values, strategy, key areas of the business and corporate governance. The Board believes strongly in the development of its Directors and the Group's colleagues. The Chairman regularly discusses training requirements with each Director. New Director induction programme is delivered through: - meetings with senior managers across the Group as well as a number of advisors: - attendance at Committee meetings: - site visits to stores and distribution centres: - working in a store, providing an opportunity to meet colleagues and see at first hand the operations of a store: and - access to a library of reference materials. In support of the ongoing development of Directors, teach-ins and technical updates are provided at Board and Committee meetings to ensure that Directors remain up to date with key developments in the business environment in which Tesco operates. Directors are encouraged to attend training sessions to ensure their knowledge is up to date on relevant legal, regulatory and financial developments or changes. The Board receives presentations on each of the business areas to understand the market conditions and challenges in the different countries the Group operates in. Directors have spent time individually and collectively exploring specific operational activities in detail through presentations, meetings and site visits giving them the opportunity to meet with local senior management to gain an insight of the business operations. The Board visits our overseas business functions on a regular basis to gain a greater understanding of the market conditions that the business operates in and to understand the challenges they face. This provides in-depth knowledge for the Directors, enabling them to share their own experiences and challenge the business. In June 2019, the Board travelled to Thailand to meet colleagues and customers, and gain a greater understanding of the Thai business operations and retail market. During the trip, the Board visited one of our Thai hypermarkets in Bangkok taking part in the 'hypermarket reinvention' programme. The programme optimises sales floor space to better cater to today's customers and their shopping experience, as well as maximising efficiency and simplifying store processes.

Board Committee composition, expertise and dynamics Strategic oversight, culture and stakeholders Effectiveness Board support, management focus of meetings, paper content, time allocation Risk management and internal control Succession planning and human resource management Board effectiveness. The internal evaluation concluded that the Board, its Committees and each of its Directors continue to be effective, with high scores being recorded across each of the themes. All Directors continued to demonstrate a collaborative and constructive mindset, creating a conducive environment at Board meetings for participation and challenge. The clarity of the strategy together with the understanding of the capabilities for implementing and monitoring it were regarded highly. The internal effectiveness review identified some opportunities for the Board and the resulting areas of focus are summarised below: - greater focus on the impact of technology and the threats and opportunities of an ever-changing market on the development of a longer-term strategy: - further increase the oversight of succession planning at the Board, while maintaining the strong oversight at the Nominations and Governance Committee: and - further developing the appetite for risk and ensuring it is aligned with the emerging longer-term strategy. The Board carries out a review of the effectiveness of its performance and that of its Committees and Directors every year. The evaluation is externally facilitated every three years. The next external evaluation will be in respect of the 2021 22 financial year.

A risk appetite framework has been developed during the year and formalised risk appetite metrics are being progressed with the business. Additional narrative is disclosed on pages 13 to 14. Developing a refreshment and succession plan for Non-executive Directors, designed to optimise strategic relevance, diversity of perspective and governance expertise to meet the future needs of the Group. A Non-executive Director composition assessment exercise was undertaken to enable the Nominations and Governance Committee to plan for the Board changes due to occur in the next few years. A skills matrix was developed to ensure that the Board has the necessary skills to fulfil its strategic objectives. During the year, an internal evaluation was led by the Chairman, with the support of the Group Company Secretary using an online questionnaire to capture the views of each Director. The evaluation was carefully structured but pragmatic, designed to bring about a genuine debate on issues that were relevant, check on progress against matters identified in the previous evaluation, and assist in identifying any potential for improvement in the Board's processes. 37 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Corporate governance",

        "Detailed Analysis of ROE": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is ROE increasing or declining?**  \n  The **Return on Equity (ROE)** has declined from **0.1670** in the previous year to **0.1594** in the current year, indicating a slight downward trend.\n\n- **Is growth in ROE higher than that of competitors and the industry?**  \n  The textual report highlights strong growth in sales, profits, and market share, but does not provide direct competitor or industry ROE data for comparison. Given the slight decline in ROE, it is likely that the company's ROE growth is below that of some competitors or the industry average, especially considering the challenging economic environment.\n\n- **Is growth persistent or temporary?**  \n  The report emphasizes Tesco's consistent long-term strategy, diversification across geographies and products, and investments in future growth areas such as Tesco Bank and international expansion. This suggests that any decline in ROE might be temporary as the company is building foundations for future improvement, especially with signs of economic recovery. The company expects returns to improve significantly starting this year.\n\n# Forecasts:\n- **Expected ROE next year**: Given the company's strategic investments, balance sheet strengthening, and improving global economic outlook, the **ROE is expected to stabilize or slightly improve next year**, potentially returning closer to or above **0.16**.\n\n# Summary:\n- Tesco\u2019s **ROE declined slightly** from **0.1670 to 0.1594**, indicating a marginal drop in profitability relative to shareholder equity in the current year.  \n- Despite the dip, the company\u2019s **long-term strategic investments** in international markets, retail services, and infrastructure position it well for future growth and **ROE recovery**.  \n- The decline is likely **temporary**, influenced by economic headwinds and start-up costs in new ventures like Fresh & Easy and Tesco Bank, but the report signals confidence in improving returns as these investments mature.  \n- Tesco\u2019s **diversification strategy** reduces dependency on any single market, mitigating risks and enhancing long-term sustainability of returns.  \n- The company's focus on operational efficiency, customer loyalty (e.g., Clubcard program), and environmental initiatives supports a resilient business model.  \n- Continued investment in non-food and retailing services, including online expansion, strengthens revenue streams beyond core grocery sales.  \n- Tesco\u2019s **balance sheet strengthening** and capital expenditure plans indicate a solid financial foundation, which should underpin ROE improvement.  \n- Risks include economic uncertainties in some international markets, competitive pressures, and regulatory environments that could impact profitability and thus ROE.  \n- The company\u2019s **commitment to community and sustainability** may enhance brand loyalty and long-term shareholder value, indirectly supporting ROE.  \n- Overall, while current ROE shows a dip, Tesco\u2019s strategic positioning and operational strengths suggest a positive outlook for **ROE recovery and growth**.",
        "Detailed Analysis of ROE Drivers": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?**  \n  The growth in ROE appears to be driven by increases in both **Assets Turnover** (from **4.03** to **4.84**) and **Profit Margin** (from **3.98%** to **4.09%**). This dual improvement is a **very good sign**, indicating the company is enhancing operational efficiency while maintaining or slightly improving profitability per unit of sales.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  The textual report highlights Tesco's strong market positions, ongoing expansion, and resilience through economic challenges, suggesting a competitive edge in efficiency and margin. However, no explicit industry or competitor ratios are provided for direct comparison. Given Tesco's leadership and consistent dividend growth, it is reasonable to infer that both **Assets Turnover** and **Profit Margin** are at least on par or better than industry averages, which is a **good sign**.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year:** Based on the continuous investment in new space and improving sales productivity described in the report, the **Asset Turnover** is expected to moderately increase or stabilize around **4.9**.\n- **Expected Profit Margin next year:** With ongoing cost efficiencies (Step Change programme) and improved product mix, **Profit Margin** is forecasted to improve slightly to approximately **4.2%**.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- Tesco\u2019s **ROE growth** is positively influenced by improvements in both **Assets Turnover** and **Profit Margin**, with the increase in efficiency being the stronger driver.\n- The company's strategic investments in new store openings and operational improvements support sustained or improved asset utilization, while margin expansion reflects effective cost management and pricing strategies.\n- Given Tesco's strong market presence, innovation in retailing services, and international expansion, the outlook for both efficiency and margin remains positive, supporting continued healthy ROE performance.",
        "Detailed Analysis of Risk": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Are risks increasing or declining?**  \n  The NLP financial risk score decreased from **0.83** to **0.54**, and the NLP tax risk also declined from **0.86** to **0.74**, indicating an overall decline in perceived financial and tax risks. The NLP legal risk remained stable at **0.5**, suggesting no change in legal risk levels. Overall, risks are **declining**.\n\n- **Is the number and severity of risks higher than competitors/industry?**  \n  The report highlights a diversified and well-managed risk approach, with strong governance and controls in place. The financial risk NLP score of **0.54** is moderate, while legal risk is stable. Without direct competitor data here, Tesco appears to maintain **average or better risk levels** compared to industry norms, especially given its broad diversification and proactive risk management.\n\n- **Is sentiment increasing or declining?**  \n  Sentiment proxies such as NLP financial, legal, and tax risks are all either stable or declining, suggesting that the tone regarding risks is becoming less negative. This indicates **improving or stable sentiment** around risk disclosures.\n\n- **Is specificity increasing or declining?**  \n  NLP specificity increased from **0.0688** to **0.0870**, indicating that the risk disclosures are becoming more detailed and precise. This suggests an **increase in disclosure specificity**.\n\n- **Are complexity measures increasing or declining?**  \n  NLP sentence length increased slightly from **26.11** to **27.02**, but sentence depth decreased marginally from **6.59** to **6.49**. This indicates **mixed complexity trends** with slightly longer but somewhat simpler sentence structures.\n\n- **How are sentiment, specificity, and complexity compared to competitors?**  \n  Tesco shows improving specificity and stable or improving sentiment, which usually reflects better transparency compared to peers who might show less disclosure detail or more negative risk sentiment. Complexity measures suggest Tesco balances detailed disclosures without excessive complexity, likely favorable relative to competitors.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Is Gearing expected to increase next year?**  \n  Gearing reduced from **2.35** to **1.90**, indicating deleveraging. Given the strong focus on strengthening the balance sheet and improving liquidity, **Gearing is expected to remain stable or decrease further** next year.\n\n- **Is Current Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  Current ratio slightly declined from **0.75** to **0.73** but remains close. With ongoing investments and strong cash flow, it is likely to **stabilize or modestly improve** next year.\n\n- **Is Quick Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  Quick ratio decreased slightly from **0.28** to **0.27**, likely reflecting inventory or working capital changes. Given the focus on operational efficiency, the **Quick Ratio is expected to stabilize or modestly increase**.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- Tesco\u2019s overall risk profile is **improving**, with **financial and tax risk sentiment declining** and legal risk stable, supported by strong governance and proactive risk management.  \n- Disclosure transparency is enhanced, with **increased specificity** in risk reporting, while complexity remains balanced to ensure clarity.  \n- Key financial metrics show a **reduction in gearing** indicating deleveraging, with liquidity ratios relatively stable, suggesting sound financial health and prudent management of financial risks.",

Thailand - and for the first time we now have more Clubcard holders internationally than in the UK. It has been another significant year for our work on the environment and within local communities. As we grow, our customers increasingly look to Tesco to take the lead in these areas - and we are. In January, we opened the world's first zero-carbon store at Ramsey in Cambridgeshire - the latest step in our journey to reduce the carbon footprint of our business. Over the past year we have made significant progress towards our long-term goals by reducing our emissions by 7.8% on our baseline 2006 7 store and distribution portfolio. This year we donated over PS60m to charities - once again exceeding our target to give the equivalent of 1% of our profits to good causes. These good results are testament to the hard work of our people. The Tesco team is now 472,000 strong - and we remain united by our goal to improve the shopping trip for our customers. I would like to thank all our people for their hard work which I know will continue in the year ahead. David Reid Chairman I am pleased to report that the Tesco team has once again delivered a good set of results - guided by experienced management who have steered the business through recessions before. As markets around the world are emerging from this recession each part of our business is well positioned to pursue our strategy for growth. We have continued to grow sales, profits and market share over the past year. We'five also significantly strengthened our balance sheet. Our acquisition in South Korea is performing well and delivering excellent results, we'five opened our first three Tesco Lifespace shopping malls in China and we have made good progress building the infrastructure and developing new products for Tesco Bank. I am also pleased to announce that we again increased our dividend - for the 26th consecutive year. This consistent track record of delivering dividend growth for shareholders is unrivalled in the FTSE 100. The strong Group results over the last year have been achieved through a constant focus on what matters most to customers in challenging times around the world. A good example of this has been our renewed focus on rewarding loyalty - at home and abroad - which has been a great success with customers. In the UK, we increased our Clubcard investment with Double Points - giving customers even greater reward for their loyalty. Internationally, we launched Clubcard in three more countries during the year - in Poland, Slovakia and 2 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 A growth busi 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 2010 472 237 People 000s 472,000 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 2010 94 28 International UK Sales area m sq ft 94m sq ft Overview T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 3 Our position amongst the leading global retailers hasn't happened by chance.

Our flexible range of formats helps us to adapt our approach to local customers - wherever they are - from Extra hypermarkets to Express convenience stores. We'five learnt how to be 'local': in South Korea, our largest international business, we have over 22,000 employees and just six UK expats. Customers expect to be able to shop where and when they want - as well as having great stores we're the most profitable online grocery retailer in the world. We're starting to unlock the benefits of being a global Group: Global sourcing volumes have grown threefold in six years Clubcard is now in seven countries F&F clothing is in ten countries Group shared services centre in Bangalore.

And we're making good progress already. We're delivering for all stakeholders: an improved shopping trip for customers: training and good careers for our staff: growth and innovation with our suppliers: in local communities we're supporting causes that matter to customers: and we're delivering good returns to shareholders. Looking forward The outlook for shareholder returns is encouraging: we have a strong core UK business growing well: our international businesses offer significant upside from recovery in the short term and maturity in the longer term: our balance sheet is strengthening: and we're creating value through good property development. Our positions in high-growth international economies and non-food meant we were always likely to face strong headwinds during the recession but it will be these parts of our business which will grow fastest in the recovery and beyond. I am confident that with the prospect of an improving global economy and recent investments in acquisitions and new selling space making a greater contribution going forward, returns will improve significantly - starting this year. Sir Terry Leahy Chief Executive Each element of our strategy - UK, International, Non-food, Retailing Services and Community - is stronger now than this time last year. In International, our businesses have made good progress in a challenging global economic environment. Our strategy is working - we'five grown sales, profits and market shares and we'five continued to invest in the drivers of future growth. Our performance in Asia was particularly pleasing, our business in Europe held up well despite the obvious economic challenges and I believe the start-up losses in our US business will now begin to reduce as Fresh & Easy establishes itself. Our UK business had a good year. By remaining focused on helping customers spend less and encouraging loyalty with an increased investment in Clubcard, our UK business has delivered a solid performance. In our core grocery operations, we're growing ahead of the industry as a whole and we have been less affected by falling inflation than the market at large. In Non-food we have made good progress. In the UK we achieved a particularly strong performance in electricals, entertainment and toys. Our clothing range is becoming an international success, led by our F&F range which is growing rapidly in our European markets and this year was launched in four countries in Asia. Our Retailing Services have grown sales and profits once again. We'five also been building the platforms for future growth, particularly in Tesco Bank, which is making good progress in developing its own systems and people capabilities as well as working on a broader product range as it moves towards becoming a fullservice retail bank. In the same way that we'five stuck to our strategy in other parts of the business, we'five also remained committed to our work on Community and the environment. In October, we set ourselves three challenging longterm targets: to become a zero-carbon This year's results show another solid performance from across the Group. By staying focused on doing the right thing for customers we have weathered the economic storm well. And by remaining committed to our longterm strategy we are emerging from recession stronger - with good building blocks in place for future growth. Our business Core UK Non-food Retailing Services International Community T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 9 Our strategy Our well-established and consistent strategy for growth has given the business momentum to grow through the downturn. Business Review This Business Review analyses the performance of the Tesco Group in the financial year ended 27 February 2010. It also explains other aspects of the Group's markets, results and operations, including strategy and risk management. The Directors present their Annual Report to shareholders on the affairs of the Group and Company, together with the audited financial statements of the Company for the 52 weeks ended 27 February 2010. Long-term strategy Tesco has a well-established and consistent strategy for growth. The rationale for the strategy is to broaden the scope of the business to enable it to deliver strong, sustainable long-term growth by following customers into large expanding markets at home - such as financial services, non-food and telecoms - and new markets abroad, initially in Central Europe and Asia and more recently in the United States. The strategy has five elements, reflecting our four established areas of focus plus Tesco's commitments on community and the environment: to be a successful international retailer: to grow the core UK business: to be as strong in non-food as in food: to develop retailing services: and to put community at the heart of what we do. The strategy to diversify the business has been the foundation of Tesco's growth in recent years. It was laid down in 1997, with the fifth element - Community - being added in 2007. Many of the new businesses that have been created and developed over the last 13 years as part of this strategy are now of significant scale and highly profitable - in fact we are now market leader in many of our markets outside the UK. In 1997 our International business generated 1.8% of the Group's profits and we had only just entered the Retailing Services markets: today these parts of our business represent 22% and 16% of profits respectively. Importantly, the strategy has given the business momentum to grow well through the economic downturn. By continuing to invest through the recession - in the customer offer, in infrastructure and in our people - we are now well placed to grow faster and improve shareholder returns as the global economic environment improves. 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Countries China Czech Republic Hungary India Japan Malaysia Poland Republic of Ireland Slovakia South Korea Thailand Turkey United States International at a glance Our international business has delivered a strong performance despite many of our markets feeling the impact of the global recession.

International Delivering great value for customers on the quality and resilience of our assets and local management teams and strengthens our confidence in our international strategy and long-term growth prospects. Asia We have delivered a strong performance in Asia despite challenging economic conditions in the region. We have grown sales and profits well - driven by new space and the excellent performance of the stores acquired in South Korea in 2008, which are now profitable. As economies generally in Asia start to recover we are seeing improving sales trends in all our businesses except Japan, where economic conditions remain subdued, with overall like-forlike sales for Asia turning positive in the fourth quarter. Profits in Asia grew by 24% with margins strengthening significantly in the second half 6.1% compared to 4.3% in the first half. In International we have delivered a resilient performance in the face of challenging economic headwinds. Our businesses have made good progress - delivering for customers today and at the same time investing in the drivers of future growth. Our strategy is working - and we ended this year stronger than we started it. Each of our businesses has adapted itself to the demands of its local market - with strong local management teams finding ways to lower costs and deliver great value for customers. Increasingly our international businesses are also utilising the scale and skill of the Tesco Group - with more international sourcing, Discount Brands now in seven markets, F&F clothing now in ten countries, Clubcard introduced in seven countries with more Clubcard holders internationally than in the UK - and the Tesco Operating Model sharing our global best practice to the benefit of all our businesses. After a very tough first half of the year we are now seeing encouraging sales trends across almost all our markets: we saw strong improvements in likefor-like sales in the fourth quarter compared to the third. With clear signs that our international markets are starting to recover we are planning to resume a faster pace of new space opening in the coming year. In 2009 10 we opened 5.1m sq ft of new space and in 2010 11 we will open 8.5m sq ft in addition to nine shopping malls in China. The performance of our International businesses through this severe recession has provided reassurance Our Asian markets offer a significant long-term opportunity. We have continued to invest through the downturn to ensure that we will be in an even stronger position as the economies recover. This year we opened 3.0m sq ft of new space across the region - an increase of more than 10% - and we plan to open 4.9m sq ft next year excluding shopping malls. We have also continued to make good progress towards developing a strong brand in our most developed Asian markets with further expansion of Clubcard and our Retailing Services businesses. The size and scale of China provides unique challenges for a retailer but also offers a huge opportunity for a business prepared to show flexibility and vision. Our strategy is to expand into less developed second and third tier cities by opening hypermarkets in leading shopping malls. We'five found it hard to find locations with the right facilities in some cities - giving us an opportunity to develop our own malls, to ensure they are the right size, location and design to meet the needs of the new Chinese consumer. During the year we opened our first three Tesco Lifespace shopping malls in Fushun pictured, Qingdao and Qinhuangdao and we will open nine more this year. Each mall comprises approximately 500,000 sq ft of retail space over five floors and is a one-stop 12 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 International continued Investing in the drivers of future growth Watch the video: www. com tescoworksforme Throughout the year we opened 63 new stores in South Korea, bringing our total number of stores to 305 South Korea Homeplus in South Korea delivered another very good performance this year with total sales growth of 33% including 3% on a like-for-like basis and profits up more than 50%. The integration of the former Homever stores has been completed successfully, ahead of plan, with the stores now trading profitably with double-digit like-for-like sales growth in the fourth quarter. South Korea also opened 63 new stores in the year. The acquisition in 2008 has helped Homeplus grow its market share and close the gap with the market leader. We opened our first franchise store in February 2010 with more scheduled to open in this financial year. South Korea is our largest international business with sales of PS4.5bn and profits of almost PS300m. Thailand Tesco Lotus in Thailand has delivered a good performance - despite a background of continued political uncertainty - with double-digit profit growth on a constant exchange rate basis. A strong store opening programme has helped drive our sales growth this year in a market in which we remain the clear market leader. Strong productivity gains have enabled us to make significant investments in lowering prices for customers whilst still delivering good margins and positive cash flow. The launch of Clubcard in August 2009 marked a new stage in the development of our business and take-up from customers has been excellent, with four million customers signed up so far. China In China, we are laying the foundations for long-term growth, with further investments in new stores, supply chain infrastructure and management. We have focused on three regions - each with its own management team - and with a focus on expansion into second and third tier cities. We opened 17 hypermarkets in the year, including in our first three Lifespace shopping centre developments in Fushun, Qingdao and Qinhuangdao, with average tenant occupancy over 80% at opening. We plan to open 23 hypermarkets in 2010 11 of which nine will be in new Lifespace malls. The mall development programme will be funded in part through joint ventures with third-party investors. The first such joint venture - incorporating three malls - was established in November 2009 with a syndicate of leading Asian investors. Malaysia Our business in Malaysia made good progress with sales growing 9% this year - increasing our market share. We continue to invest in Clubcard with more than one million customers signed up and with a dunnhumby team working with us locally to provide insight on pricing, range and promotions. We grew our space by 11% this year but with the economy starting to show signs of recovery we plan to step this up to 27% growth in 2010 11. Japan In our 2008 9 Annual Report, we stated that with the challenging market conditions in Japan, we had only limited headroom on the carrying value of our Japan assets. Given the further deterioration in the retail market, it became appropriate to make impairments against the goodwill arising on the acquisition we made to enter the market in 2003, resulting in a PS131m charge to the income statement PS82m in the first half and PS49m in the second half. Our team in Japan continues to make good progress in developing the business. Our new convenience format is receiving good feedback from customers who like the focus on fresh food and new features helping us to differentiate our offer, such as the in-store bakery, an extensive wine range and our first 400 own-label products - which after only a few months already account for 10% of sales. India Our early plans in India are progressing well. Our local management team is helping our franchise partner, Trent, to develop its Star Bazaar hypermarket operation which is currently achieving like-for-like sales of c. 40% and buys more than 70% of its products from Tesco's wholesale business. Plans for our cash and carry business are also on track with our first store expected to open towards the end of this year.

Ji Tesco customer Shanghai, China 14 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 International continued Our flagship My Narodni department store in Prague reopened in September 2009 after a major refit Europe Europe overall delivered a robust performance against strong economic headwinds in the form of a sharp downturn in economic activity causing a slow-down in customer expenditure. Sales growth varied across the region with a good contribution from new space helping sales grow in Poland and Turkey and stay stable in the Czech Republic and Hungary. Significant price deflation and cross-border shopping driven by rapid movements in exchange rates resulted in sales declining in Slovakia and Ireland. Overall, however, the sales trends are now improving: each of our European businesses showed an improvement in like-for-like sales growth in the fourth quarter. We have made market share gains across our Central European markets by reducing costs and lowering prices for customers and by continuing to invest in new space. Profitability in the region as a whole declined slightly compared with last year but was resilient given the severity of recession. We are continuing to invest in the region, opening 1.8m sq ft of new space during the year - less than originally expected, primarily as a result of the economic environment. With the outlook improving we will be stepping up the rate of opening with a plan to add 3.1m sq ft of new space across the region in 2010 11. Republic of Ireland In Ireland we have made substantial changes to our business, which was facing the dual challenge of a severe recession and cross-border trading. By integrating more of our international brand buying with our UK business we have been able to reduce the prices of 12,500 products by an average of around 20%. Customers are responding enthusiastically to our improved pricing and range: significant uplifts in volumes have now offset the impact of lower prices, resulting in positive like-for-like sales growth in the last few weeks of the year and a growing market share. These changes, combined with a substantial cost reduction programme, have enabled Tesco Ireland to deliver a steady financial performance despite the economic headwinds and significant self-imposed price deflation. The cost of the exceptional restructuring activities was PS33m in total for the year. Hungary Our business in Hungary continues to perform well - with sales levels being maintained despite a very weak economy in which unemployment levels increased by more than 25% and consumers were hit with a 5% increase in sales tax. We are continuing to execute our strategy of investing in the shopping trip for customers, helping our overall market share to grow again in the last year, further consolidating our market leadership. Poland In Poland, we have had another good year with strong growth in sales and profits on a constant exchange rate basis. A good performance from the converted Leader Price stores, the popularity of our Discount Brands - now in one in three baskets - and our clothing range, which achieved like-for-like sales growth of more than 20%, have helped our business maintain positive ex-petrol like-forlike sales growth overall. The launch of Clubcard in August 2009 has been very well received, with 1.8 million customers signing up so far. Czech Republic In the Czech Republic our strong new store opening programme has helped us maintain sales at levels similar to last year and improve our share of a market affected by high unemployment and price deflation. Our Express and 10,000 sq ft format stores continue to do well with positive like-for-like sales growth, but as in most markets, growth in the larger stores remains subdued as customers curtail their spending on non-food in the current environment. The outstanding category in nonfood has been clothing with doubledigit sales growth. Our flagship My Narodni department store in Prague was reopened after a major refit project and we are pleased with the results to date. The first T esco outside the UK opened just 15 years ago - in Hungary With growing sales and improvements in productivity, waste and distribution costs, store economics are improving steadily. Overall trading losses were in line with guidance provided last year and reflect the fact that Fresh & Easy has been built with the infrastructure to support hundreds of stores. We expect to open new stores at a rate of around one per week this year with a focus on areas where the local economy has been less severely hit and where we are seeing substantially stronger sales performance. One of the benefits of the downturn is a slightly softer property market: we are now able to buy more freehold properties and the overall cost of building a store has fallen by approximately 20%. A combination of new space and organic sales growth means that sales growth this year will be more than 50%. Although we do not expect losses to be much lower in 2010 11 we believe they have now peaked. T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 15 Our business 145 Fresh & Easy stores by end of 2009 10 Asia 1,230 Europe 954 US 145 International stores Slovakia In Slovakia, the overall retail market has been very challenging with rising unemployment and sharp falls in industrial output. Cross-border shopping remained significant for much of the first half but abated in the second half after we reduced our prices within Slovakia to bring them more closely into line with neighbouring countries. Like-for-like sales growth is recovering strongly: from negative double digit for the first half to positive growth in the final few weeks of the year. A good store opening programme combined with investments in the shopping trip and customer loyalty - with Clubcard launching in Slovakia in September 2009 - have helped us extend our market-leading position further during the year. We have recently refitted and rebranded one of our large hypermarkets in Bratislava as an 'Extra' adding new departments such as pharmacy, photo processing, opticians and phone shop. This is the first of its type in Central Europe. Turkey In Turkey, whilst we slowed our rate of new store growth, it remained strong enough to offset the like-forlike sales decline, helping us to grow overall sales during the year. With the economy showing early signs of recovery we are planning to resume a faster rate of expansion this year. Turkey remains an important strategic long-term opportunity for us as a large, growing and relatively underdeveloped retail market. United States In the United States, Fresh & Easy has been making good progress, despite prolonged weakness in the California, Nevada and Arizona economies. Customers are enthusiastic about our range, particularly the fresh food prepared in the Fresh & Easy kitchen, the store environment and the friendly service. As with any of our new businesses, we are adapting and improving our offer in response to customer feedback. During the year we'five broadened the range in some key categories - like cereals and pet food - and added larger pack sizes for families. We have also introduced a range of lower-priced house brands to help families on a budget. With the improvements to our range implemented and with the number of stores growing 145 stores by end of 2009 10, we launched media campaigns - in September 2009 and January 2010 - focusing on how Fresh & Easy can offer both high quality and low prices. A combination of increased customer awareness and the improvements we have made instore helped to drive stronger positive like-for-like sales growth in the second half of the year. 16 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Core UK at a glance Our market-leading UK business has continued to grow well by helping customers to spend less during the downturn. Clubcard - 15 years of loyalty Clubcard is our unique way of saying thank you to our customers for shopping with us. Launched in 1995, Clubcard now has 15 million active members in the UK. Clubcard not only rewards our customers for their loyalty, but it also provides us with valuable insight into changing shopping patterns. By monitoring this data and spotting trends early we're able to respond quickly and ensure that we're always providing customers with what they want, when and where they want it. This year Clubcard became even more rewarding. By increasing our investment with Double Points, customers earned PS550m in total in vouchers. Double Points has encouraged more customers to sign up, a Clubcard is now used with a higher proportion of transactions than before and 18% more UK households are redeeming vouchers than a year ago. The knowledge and expertise of operating Clubcard - combined with insight and analysis from dunnhumby - is now being adopted across our international businesses.

T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 17 Our business Core UK Sustainable profitable growth Based on our dotcom picking availability measure. Our UK business delivered a solid performance in competitive market conditions. We are growing faster than the industry as a whole and we have achieved this by remaining focused - as always - on customers. Our strategy of earning their loyalty by helping them to spend less - with low prices and affordable new products such as the Discount Brands - deflated sales growth initially but it was the right thing to do for customers. By encouraging and rewarding loyalty - through an increased investment in Clubcard - we have maintained steadier sales growth during the year than the industry as a whole, which has seen a significant slowdown with the steep decline in inflation. Excluding petrol and adjusting for VAT, like-for-like sales were 3.7% in the first half and 2.7% in the second half, driven by a strong volume performance. Achieving our target of opening 2m sq ft of new space during the year ensured that sales from new space made a good contribution to total sales growth, which was 6.5% for the first half and 5.7% for the second half excluding petrol and adjusted for VAT. Delivering for customers through recession is not just about lowering prices and offering great promotions: it's about delivering all elements of the shopping trip. Consequently, we have continued to invest in availability, service, range and quality with pleasing results: Availability Availability has improved again this year as a result of a number of initiatives to improve stock management including more efficient ordering systems, a greater focus on clearing promotional and discontinued lines, better in-store monitoring processes and storing stock on the top of shelves on the shop floor rather than in the warehouse. The results have not only increased availability based on our dotcom picking measure and reduced evening gaps in fresh food by 18%, but the resulting reduction in stock across our store network has made a significant contribution to our improved working capital position. Service Service remains a key differentiator. Our one-in-front initiative - where if there is more than one customer queuing at a single checkout we open another - and increased investment in self-service checkouts, which now account for a quarter of all transactions, continue to keep us ahead of the industry on customer measures of checkout service. We trained more than 200,000 staff to help them respond better to customer needs and our 'Every Comment Helps' initiative, which encourages customers to give instant feedback via text or email, has given us the benefit of 60,000 customer comments to help us improve our offer and service. Range Tesco's diverse and adaptable range allows us to offer a wide choice for every customer whatever their budget. Through the recession we have helped customers with lowerpriced ranges such as Discount Brands and Market Value and we have also offered them affordable treats such as the Finest Restaurant Collection ready meals, which have been very popular. We continue to innovate our range with over 2,600 new or improved own-label food lines launched this year. As the economy starts to emerge from recession we are seeing customers buy more from our Finest range, which returned to positive like-for-like sales growth in the year. 2,600 new or improved own-label food lines launched this year 200,000 staff trained in 'Every little helps' skills Watch the video: www. com tescoworksforme 18 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 At Tesco we're constantly striving to make things better, simpler and cheaper. That's why we'five launched three innovative and popular iPhone apps. Customers no longer have to worry about forgetting their Clubcard as our latest app enables them to scan their Clubcard on their iPhone. This app is proving extremely popular with customers with over 200,000 downloads in the first three weeks and there will soon be versions for other smartphones too. Store Finder app enables customers to find their nearest stores and then locate products complete with prices within the store - to the exact aisle. Our wine app allows customers to take a photo of a wine they like and uses image recognition software to identify iPhone apps - making life easier for customers the wine, providing full product information and allowing customers to order from their phone. Coming soon is another tesco. com app which will enable customers to do their tesco. com grocery ordering from their phone. Core UK continued Delivering an 'Every little helps' shopping trip Quality Quality - particularly in fresh food - remains important to customers even in tough times and as we emerge from recession this will become even more important. That's why we have been investing in our fresh food offer with a wide-ranging change programme. Improved technical standards, additional specialist staff training, closer relationships with our suppliers and significant changes to the way we merchandise some key products are helping us deliver a stronger range and better shopping experience for customers. These and other initiatives helped Tesco win the 'Fresh Produce Retailer of the Year' Award in 2009. Step Change Our UK Step Change programme is in its thirteenth year and continues to go from strength to strength. This year we met our PS550m savings target. Step Change is not just about generating savings - each project must be 'better' for customers, 'simpler' for staff and 'cheaper' for Tesco. Our stock reduction programme is an excellent example of this: it's better for customers because it has driven a large improvement in availability for both food and non-food: it's simpler for staff because it is now easier to locate stock to fill the shelves and stock errors can be identified more easily: and it's cheaper for Tesco because stores now hold less stock and fewer hours are needed to replenish the shelves. For example, a typical Tesco Extra now holds 8% less stock and we are now looking at releasing backroom space which can be redeployed for Retailing Services or Non-food. This year we aim to complete a global programme that will deliver savings of PS800m and we'll invest most of these savings back into our offer for customers. New space Through the experience and expertise of our property teams we have developed over a number of years a good pipeline of new space opportunities. As a result we have the opportunity to unwind some of the work-in-progress we have built up and will be stepping up the rate of expansion in 2010 11. We will be investing PS1.6bn of capital in the UK economy this year and will create thousands of jobs for people, including the long-term unemployed through our Regeneration Partnerships. Sustainable strategy Our customer strategy is sustainable for the long term because we can differentiate Tesco in a unique way with Clubcard and because our low prices and improvements to the customer shopping trip are based on permanent productivity gains. Our growth strategy for the UK is also sustainable as it is based on taking a balanced approach to the key building blocks of top-line growth: solid likefor-like performance and a consistent contribution from new stores.

Our first ever purpose-built import storage facility, which opened in Middlesbrough in August, fulfils both these objectives whilst also creating 800 jobs in the local community. The 910,000 sq ft Teesport distribution centre offers a traditional low bay assembly operation and high density storage within a fully automated high bay warehouse providing a capability of holding 160,000 pallets and assembling up to 4.5 million cases per week. The scale of Teesport, along with its port location and on-site rail infrastructure, has helped reduce costs in our T eesport - helping us get better, simpler and cheaper distribution network, which in turn helps us keep prices low for customers. Teesport has also delivered major environmental benefits by removing over 12,000 lorry journeys per year from the UK's roads. This has made a significant step towards our target to halve distribution emissions of each case delivered by 2012, against a baseline of 2006. Sales UK PS9.0bn International PS4.1bn Our non-food performance has been very resilient through the downturn. In some key categories we have made significant market share gains as more customers have been encouraged to try our non-food range in the search for great value and as some competitors have felt the strain. Group non-food sales rose 6.2% to PS13.1bn, with PS9.0bn in the UK and PS4.1bn in International. We delivered a very strong non-food performance in the UK with steadily improving like-for-like sales during the year. A number of categories had particularly strong growth: Electricals With competitive prices, a great range - in-store and online - and over 1,000 Tesco Tech Support advisors in our UK stores to help customers make their choice, we are rapidly growing our presence in the electricals market. We now sell one in every six microwaves in the UK and one in four small-screen TVs. Our sales in electricals have doubled in the last four years and around 20% are online. Entertainment Our market share in games has doubled in the last year as a result of allocating it more space in-store, revamping the range and layout and being more competitive on new releases. As part of our drive to lower prices for customers, we make every effort to cut out the middlemen and source products from manufacturers or developers. For example, we teamed up with DreamWorks studio for the exclusive rights to sell the short animated Christmas film Merry Madagascar. This groundbreaking relationship was the first of its kind in the industry and enabled Tesco to sell over one million Merry Madagascar DVDs. Toys Our sales in toys have grown 25% this year with online sales up more than 60%. Clothing Sales grew by 7.3%, including positive like-for-like growth, to reach PS1bn in sales for the first time, helped by a 15% increase in children's wear and the launch of our online clothing range.

F&F launched in the UK in 2001 and has expanded rapidly since then with sales last year of PS540m in the UK - supported by the launch of our online clothing site in October. F&F launched in Central Europe in 2008 and we're already making excellent progress. F&F is rapidly becoming established in the region with customer awareness of the brand growing from 34% to 61% in the last year. Across our markets in Central Europe, Tesco is already one of the largest clothing retailers. In fact during the year we sold more F&F items - 68 million - than the combined populations of our F&F - a global brand four countries in the region: Poland: Hungary: Czech Republic: and Slovakia. We're now building on the success in the UK and Central Europe to launch F&F across our Asian markets. This year we launched in China, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand. As with any brand, F&F can't afford to stand still, which is why we're broadening the brand's appeal with new ranges - F&F Couture and F&F Jewellery. International clothing Clothing is becoming a global strength and a good example of how we are bringing global scale and skill to our international businesses. In our four Central European markets, clothing like-for-like sales grew 14% this year - following strong growth the previous year - in a market which has been declining overall in the recession. We'five also introduced F&F ranges to four Asian markets this year - another step in developing F&F into a global brand. Joint buying - whereby 95% of the supplier base in Central Europe is the same as Ireland and the UK - has brought the benefits of Group expertise and scale, helping to improve quality and costs. Online Shopping habits are changing - customers want to buy online as well as from stores and catalogues - and many will use a combination of these to research before buying. With an integrated multichannel approach we're making it easy for customers, whichever way they want to shop. In addition to the 15,500 products available online through Tesco Direct, we now have two new specialist websites launched in October: www. t e s c o. c o m c l o t h i n g Our new clothing site combines familiar Tesco labels such as Cherokee and F&F with some new Tesco lines exclusively offered online, plus a number of other brands. The site became one of the top ten most visited clothing websites within weeks of its launch. So far the customer feedback has been very strong, particularly on value for money and ease of shop. com entertainment The launch of Tesco Entertainment brought together, for the first time, our entire physical and digital entertainment offer, in a new and easy-to-use one-stop site. Customers are now able to buy a CD, DVD or game and a film or album download, all in one transaction. From the outset the new website has proved popular with customers. 1,000 Tesco Tech Support advisors in UK stores Watch the video: www. com dunnhumby serves other retailers and manufacturers in 26 international markets 26 24 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Retailing Services at a glance We'five made good progress this year in our Retailing Services businesses: Tesco Bank: tesco. com - a leading online retailer Including both our grocery and non-food offer, tesco. com is one of the largest online retailers in the UK, with sales of more than PS2bn. Just as in our stores, our success comes from listening to customers and a constant drive to ensure that we provide an online 'Every little helps' shopping experience. With more than a million active customers, our online grocery business is the market leader and the most profitable business of its kind in the world. It continues to grow strongly - last year we delivered over one billion items. We have put ease of use at the heart of our online shopping trip - for example, our 'favourites' feature, which makes shopping online easier by using Clubcard to remember a customer's favourite in-store and online purchases. We also continue to innovate with our 'price match' on any substituted products and our 'shorter than we'd like' code life guarantee. Tesco Direct extends the reach of our non-food offer with over 15,500 products available to customers via the internet and catalogues. Customers can choose to have goods delivered to their home or they can pick them up at one of our 261 in-store Direct desks. This year we relaunched our online entertainment site, enabling customers to buy downloads alongside the physical product, and we launched our online clothing website with a range of 2,500 fashionable items, of which 1,000 were exclusively online.

This year we made good progress in attracting new customers and growing sales and profits while at the same time laying the foundations for further growth. Total Retailing Services sales were PS3.6bn, up 4.2% on last year and profits were PS540m, up 17.6%. Tesco Bank Overall, Tesco Bank has delivered a good performance in a challenging retail banking market growing profits by 13% to PS250m. Bad debt levels rose during the year but have now stabilised and throughout have remained below industry averages. We have absorbed additional costs as we begin the process of moving the business onto its own infrastructure and build the team as we prepare the business for faster growth. Commercial performance We grew the number of customer accounts by more than 400,000 in the last year - to a total of more than 6.2 million across all products. We have achieved double-digit customer growth in our banking products, including 27% growth in personal loans. In insurance we held our number of policies broadly flat in a very competitive market: the number of motor insurance policies declined - partly as a result of a planned reduction in our exposure to high-risk drivers - but the number of policies in home, pet and life insurance increased. Our 130 in-store travel bureaux saw an increase in transactions of more than 80% and the number of ATMs in our network grew to over 2,800. Profit Gross profit grew 19% to PS749m with a good performance in banking being partly offset by lower profitability in insurance, primarily as a result of lower investment income linked to the current low interest rate environment. Trading profit was up 13.1% to PS250m compared to PS221m in 2008 9 on a pro forma basis. Profit before tax was PS114m - with the primary deduction from operating profit being the previously announced PS127m noncash amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition. This profit performance was achieved after an increase in operating costs - as a result of the change of ownership as the business prepares for expansion - and against the background of a 32% increase in bad debts - to PS177m which was in part offset by a credit relating to the unwind of the fair value adjustment created on acquisition. Capital and liquidity The Tier 1 capital ratio at the end of 2009 10 was 13.0%. The funding and liquidity position of the business remained robust throughout the period with customer deposits in excess of customer lending. This is further supported by a high-quality liquid asset portfolio, net short-term wholesale cash and investment grade assets worth PS1.3bn. Management team During the year good progress has been made in completing the recruitment of an experienced management team in all areas of the Bank: finance: risk: legal: commercial: treasury: and IT. All senior roles have now been filled. Infrastructure In September 2009 we entered into an agreement with Fortis UK Ltd to help us build the operational platform and technical expertise required to further develop our insurance business. We have also selected the core technology platforms for the banking products. The migration programmes for both sides of the business are progressing well and we expect to be writing business on the new systems by the end of 2010 11. We have secured new premises for banking and insurance operations in Glasgow and Newcastle, which will open in mid 2010, creating 1,800 jobs. New product development Subject to regulatory approval we anticipate launching new savings products and mortgages by the end of financial year 2010 11, with current accounts to follow in the second half of 2011. 6.2 million Tesco Bank customers Double-digit customer growth in our banking products 26 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Retailing Services continued Growing sales and profits tesco. com Our online businesses - including dotcom grocery and Direct - delivered another strong performance, achieving a 14% increase in sales with profits rising 26% to PS136m. In a little over a decade we have built a substantial profitable business that has sales of PS2.1bn and employs 20,000 people. Our website is the third most visited retail website in the UK and last year our online grocery business delivered over a billion items. The number of active customers in our online grocery business has grown to over one million and basket size has increased. Record levels of availability and innovations such as price matching on substitutions are improving the customer experience and helping to reduce the number of lapsed customers and calls to the service centre. We are reducing costs and carbon emissions by improving fuel consumption per order by 10% for the second year running through implementing new technology to improve driving and routing efficiency. Tesco Direct extends the reach of our non-food offer to customers via the internet, by phone and catalogues. Customers can choose to have goods delivered to their home or they can pick them up at one of our 261 instore Direct desks. Tesco Direct had another good year making good progress on its customer service offer, growing sales by 28% and continuing on its path towards profitability. Tesco Telecoms Profit from our telecoms business grew, driven primarily by Tesco Mobile, which achieved a 14% increase in customer numbers - to more than two million - in a declining pre-pay phone market. Tesco Mobile also successfully entered the 'pay monthly' market this year with innovative tariffs and generous credit rewards, picking up the 'best tariff' accolade at the 2009 Mobile Choice Awards. Tesco Mobile remained the number one pay-as-you-go operator for customer satisfaction throughout 2009. In December 2009, Tesco Mobile broadend its appeal further by becoming only the third UK operator to offer the iPhone, for which sales have been encouraging. We have made good progress in rolling out our in-store Phone Shops with 105 open at year end and a further 100 planned by the end of this year. The Phone Shops are transforming our ability to sell products that require an assisted sale - particularly contract mobile phones. Also in 2009 we signed a wholesale broadband agreement with Cable & Wireless, which will enable us to relaunch our broadband offer to customers in 2010 with higher bandwidth speeds and lower prices. dunnhumby This year marks dunnhumby's 20th anniversary. In addition to supporting Tesco's Clubcard in seven countries around the world, dunnhumby serves other retailers and manufacturers in 26 international markets: in fact Tesco now represents only around 15% of its sales. dunnhumby is growing fast - with profits up 28% in the year - helped by new engagements in the United States Macy's, Canada Metro and Colombia Exito. dunnhumby now touches the lives of over 350 million consumers through its client relationships. 1 for customer satisfaction Source: Customer Service Index Watch the video: www. com tescoworksforme T elecoms T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 27 Our business \"...

This unites the Group's resources and in particular focuses the efforts of our staff around our customers, people, operations, finance and the community. Its prime focus is as a management tool for the Company so that there is appropriate balance in the tradeoffs that need to be made between the main levers of management - such as operations measures, financial measures or delivery of customer metrics. It therefore enables the business to be operated and monitored on a balanced basis with due regard to the needs of all stakeholders. For the owners of the business, it is simply based around the philosophy that if we look after customers and staff well and operate efficiently and effectively then shareholders' interests will always be best served by the inevitable outputs of those - growth in sales, profits and returns. 2010 2009 2008 Sales growth Change in Group sales over the year including value added tax 6.8% 15.1% 11.1% UK sales growth 4.2% 9.5% 6.7% International sales growth 8.8% 30.6% 25.3% International sales growth at constant exchange rates 6.6% 13.6% 22.5% Retailing Services sales growth 4.2% 11% - Profit before tax PS3,176m PS2,917m PS2,803m Underlying profit before tax PS3,395m PS3,124m PS2,846m Trading margin UK trading margin 6.2% 6.2% 5.9% International trading margin excluding the United States 5.3% 5.3% 5.6% Trading margin is calculated from the trading profit expressed as a percentage of Group revenue sales excluding value added tax and excluding the impact of IFRIC 13.

We monitor a wide range of KPIs, both financial and non-financial. Individual business units have their own versions of the Steering Wheel which incorporate their own priorities and KPIs. Some of the Group KPIs below are tracked through the Steering Wheel and those above are tracked as a monitor of investor return. Across the Group, KPIs are set for local markets, with oversight from the Executive Directors, to ensure they are tailored to drive the priorities of each business. The following are some KPIs for the UK and Group operations: 2010 2009 2008 UK market share Grocery market share 22.5% 22.2% 21.8% New non-food market share 4.1% 3.6% 3.5% Employee retention 90% 87% 84% This measure shows the percentage of employees who have stayed with the business for longer than one year.

T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 41 Our business Risks and uncertainties Introduction Risk is an accepted part of doing business. The real challenge for any business is to identify the principal risks it faces and to develop and monitor appropriate controls. A successful risk management process balances risks and rewards and relies on a sound judgement of their likelihood and consequence. The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and internal control within the context of achieving the Group's objectives. Our process for identifying and managing risks is set out in more detail from page 49 of the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report and Financial Statements. The key risks faced by the Group and relevant mitigating factors are set out below. Business strategy If our strategy follows the wrong direction or is not effectively communicated then the business may suffer. We need to understand and properly manage strategic risk in order to deliver long-term growth for the benefit of all our stakeholders. Our strategy is based on five elements: to become a successful international retailer, to grow the core UK business, be as strong in non-food as in food, develop retailing services and put the community at the heart of what we do. Pursuit of this five-part strategy has allowed the business to diversify and, at a strategic level, diversification and pursuit of growth in emerging markets have the effect of reducing overall risk by avoiding reliance on a small number of business areas. However, by its very nature, diversification also introduces new risks to be managed in areas of the business that are less mature and less fully understood. To ensure the Group continues to pursue the right strategy, the Board discusses strategic issues at every Board meeting and dedicates two full days a year to reviewing the Group's strategy. The Executive Committee also discusses strategy on a regular basis. We have structured programmes for engaging with all our stakeholders including customers, employees, investors, suppliers, government, media and non-governmental organisations. We also invest significant resources in ensuring our strategy is communicated well and understood by the parties who are key to delivering it. The business operates a Steering Wheel a balanced scorecard process whereby we set goals for different areas of the business and assess our overall progress on a quarterly basis in all countries and significant business units to help manage performance and deliver business strategy. Financial strategy and Group treasury risk The main financial risks of the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. The risks associated with operating Tesco Bank are covered under Financial services risks below. The Treasury function is mandated by the Board to manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs. The function has clear policies and operating parameters, and its activities are routinely reviewed and audited. The function does not operate as a profit centre and the undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted. A description of the role of the Finance Committee, Internal Audit and External Audit is set out in the Corporate Governance section on page 50. Financial services risks Through Tesco Bank, the Group is subject to certain risks relating to the personal financial services industry in the UK. Tesco Bank is subject to significant legislative and regulatory oversight. In particular, Tesco Bank is subject to supervision by the Financial Services Authority FSA which has substantial powers of intervention and requires it to satisfy certain capital adequacy and liquidity ratios. If Tesco Bank is unable to or fails to satisfy these ratios in the future it could lose its licence and, consequently, its ability to transact business. Tesco Bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesco on 19 December 2008. In preparation for this change its risk management and treasury capabilities were materially strengthened. All policies pertaining to risk within the Bank are now subject to Tesco Bank specific governance procedures which are owned by the Tesco Bank Board. Tesco Bank has a banking business, predominantly in the UK, with the three main products being credit cards, unsecured personal loans and savings. It has also developed a significant insurance business, with motor, home and pet insurance being the main products. Tesco Bank is subject to various risks associated with the provision of financial services. In relation to its insurance business Tesco Bank may experience a concentration of risks from natural or man-made disasters. In addition market conditions may not allow it to purchase the amount of re-insurance it considers necessary on terms it considers acceptable. Actual claims may exceed the claims provisions that have been made on the basis of past experience. Tesco Bank's credit card receivables and personal loan portfolio may be subject to changes in credit quality, due to a general deterioration in economic conditions or to failures in its credit assessment process, which could adversely impact its ability to recover amounts due. Furthermore, there is significant competition in the financial services industry which could adversely affect Tesco Bank's profitability. Legal developments, changes in legal interpretation or precedent and changes in public policy may result in new risks emerging in addition to those anticipated. Tesco Bank is in the process of building new banking and insurance systems and until these are complete there is an increased element of operational risk as most operations are outsourced to Royal Bank of Scotland. Tesco Bank retains the risk to its insurance activities posed by external factors, such as a large weather-related event. Tesco Bank is an FSA-regulated entity and so its treasury function is run independently from the rest of the Group. Tesco Bank's treasury risks include liquidity risk and interest rate risk in particular, in the interest rate margin realised between lending and borrowing costs. Tesco Bank is also subject to the risk of unexpected losses arising from operational failure, whether as a result of human error, systems failures, fraud or inadequate controls. Tesco Bank monitors these risks through its governance structures, assessing any potential impact and action required to manage them. The work of the Risk Committee focuses on systemic risks such as funding, credit risk and risks in the insurance business, while the Tesco Bank Audit Committee considers internal controls and assurance. Operational threats and performance risk in the business There is a risk that our business may not deliver the stated strategy in full, particularly since, like all retailers, the business is susceptible to economic downturn that could affect consumer spending. The continuing acquisition and development of property sites also forms an intrinsic part of our strategy and this carries inherent risks. 42 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Risks and uncertainties continued We aim to deliver what customers want better than our competitors by understanding and responding to their needs. All of our business units have stretching targets based on the Steering Wheel and the performance of business units is monitored continually and reported regularly to the Board. We manage the acquisition and development of our property assets carefully. We consider and assess in detail every site at each stage of acquisition and development and ensure that relevant action is taken to minimise any risks. Competition and consolidation The retail industry is highly competitive. The Group competes with a wide variety of retailers of varying sizes and faces increased competition from UK retailers as well as international operators in the UK and overseas. Failure to compete with competitors on areas including price, product range, quality and service could have an adverse effect on the Group's financial results. We aim to have a broad appeal on price, range and store format in a way that allows us to compete in different markets. We track performance against a range of measures that customers tell us are critical to their shopping trip experience and we constantly monitor customer perceptions of ourselves and our competitors to ensure we can respond quickly if we need to. People capabilities Employees are our greatest asset. It is critical to our success to attract, retain, develop and motivate the best people with the right capabilities at all levels of operations. We review our people policies regularly and are committed to investing in training and development and incentives for our people. Our 'Talent Planning' process helps individuals achieve their full potential. We also carry out succession planning to ensure that the future needs of the business are considered and provided for. There are clear processes for understanding and responding to employees' needs through our People Matters Group, staff surveys, regular performance reviews, involvement of trade unions in relevant markets and regular communication of business developments. We take a proactive approach to encouraging diversity at all levels within the business. Reputational risk As the largest retailer in the UK, expectations of the Group are high. Failure to protect the Group's reputation and brand could lead to a loss of trust and confidence. This could result in a decline in the customer base and affect the ability to recruit and retain good people. Like other companies we must consider potential threats to our reputation and the consequences of reputational damage. Emotional loyalty to the Tesco brand has helped us diversify into new areas like retail services and non-food and we recognise the commercial imperative to do the right thing for all our stakeholders and avoid the loss of such loyalty. The Tesco Values are embedded in the way we do business at every level and our Group Code of Business Conduct guides our behaviour in our dealings with customers, employees and suppliers. We engage with stakeholders in every sphere to take into account their views and we try to ensure our strategy reflects them. Since the launch of the Community Plan in 2006 we have demonstrated our commitment to tackling a wide range of societal and environmental issues. We have high level committees, including the Executive Committee, Corporate Responsibility Committee and Group Compliance Committee to help guide and monitor our policies. Environmental risks The main environmental risk we face is the threat of climate change and it is essential that we work to mitigate it through energy efficiency, the sustainable management of other resources and waste minimisation. We engage with key stakeholders and experts in developing environmental policy, including through the Sustainable Consumption Institute we have endowed at Manchester University. Environmental strategy and policies are reviewed regularly by the Corporate Responsibility Committee. Our climate change strategy is driven by a belief that proactive environmental performance will be rewarded by consumers and that providing the means by which consumers can adopt low-carbon lifestyles will increasingly be a route to competitive advantage. Product safety The safety and quality of our products is of paramount importance to Tesco as well as being essential for maintaining customer trust and confidence. A breach of confidence could affect the size of our customer base and hence financial results. We have detailed and established procedures for ensuring product integrity at all times, especially for our own-label products. There are strict product safety processes and regular management reports. We work in partnership with suppliers to ensure mutual understanding of the standards required. We also monitor developments in areas such as health, safety and nutrition in order to respond appropriately to changing customer trends and new legislation. We have clear processes for crisis management, pulling together expert teams should we need to respond quickly on issues. Health and safety risks The safety of our staff and customers is of the utmost importance to us. If we are unable to provide safe environments for our staff and customers this could lead to injuries or loss of life. We operate stringent health and safety processes in line with best practice in our stores, distribution centres and offices which are monitored and audited regularly. KPIs for health and safety help prevent incidents and form an intrinsic part of our Steering Wheel across the business. Performance against these KPIs is reported quarterly. Our Group Compliance Committee and the Compliance Committees in our business units monitor the level of compliance with both health and safety laws and our internal policies on a regular basis. Ethical risks in the supply chain Millions of people around the world work directly for suppliers to Tesco and the supply chain is made of complex relationships - from individual farmers and growers through to processors, manufacturers and distributors. At the heart of our Values is our belief that we should treat people as we like to be treated and we have a responsibility to help workers in our supply chain enjoy fair labour standards. We therefore require our suppliers to meet strict criteria on labour standards, and as a founder member of the Ethical Trading Initiative ETI, we expect all our suppliers to follow the ETI Base Code and guarantee their workers the rights set out within it. There is, however, a risk that any part of the supply chain might not adhere to these high standards. T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 43 Our business To minimise this risk we only work with suppliers who can demonstrate that they are committed to the ETI Base Code and share our Values. We use Supplier Ethical Data Exchange SEDEX to carry out risk assessment of all our direct suppliers and all medium and high-risk suppliers must undergo an extensive, independent ethical audit. We continue to operate a comprehensive programme of audit improvements, including more unannounced audits and an industry-leading Auditor Recognition programme. We have also sought to involve more multi-stakeholder representatives on our audits to improve workforce engagement and enable activists to see and give feedback on our approach. We work with suppliers to identify any problems and, where they exist, support suppliers in taking action to improve standards for their workers. We have invested heavily in building the labour standards capabilities of our suppliers and our own commercial teams in the last year, including rolling out extensive training to help them identify and avoid issues before they arise. We also work with businesses, governments, non-governmental organisations NGOs and others to tackle complex and systemic problems that we cannot solve on our own. As well as having a key role in the ETI we also work closely with the Global Social Compliance Programme and other groups in specific industries and regions. Fraud and compliance As the business grows in size and geographical spread, the risk of the occurrence of fraudulent behaviour by our employees increases. Whilst the vast majority of our staff are completely honest, there remains the potential for fraud and other dishonest activity at all levels of the business, from the shop floor to senior management. The Group takes extensive steps to reduce this risk. Relevant accounting and other procedures and controls at all levels are clearly set out and audited across the business to reduce the risk of fraud. The Group gives clear guidance on behaviour to employees through the Tesco Values and the Group Code of Business Conduct. Internal Audit undertakes detailed investigations into all areas of the business and highlights its findings to the Audit Committee. The Compliance Committee formulates and monitors the implementation of, and compliance with, appropriate policies on key areas of ethical behaviour, including fraud. Property We have stretching targets for delivering new space in all of our markets and may face challenges in finding suitable sites and obtaining planning or other consents to enable sites to be acquired and developed. The complexity of many of our property developments is increasing, especially the growing number of malls and mixed-use schemes. We also have to comply with design and construction standards which vary significantly from country to country. Our Property Acquisition Committee and other related committees in the UK, Europe, Asia and the US closely control all aspects of the property acquisition, planning and construction processes to ensure that applicable standards are met and financial risks are minimised. Our Group and country Compliance Committees also monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in all aspects of our property activities. Non-food risks As the proportion of our business represented by non-food products increases, there is a risk that a downturn in consumer confidence may affect the level of demand for products which consumers may regard as non-essential. We make every effort to ensure that our non-food products are competitively priced and offer a broad range of products ranging from value to the luxury end of the market in order to cater for the needs of as wide a range of customers as possible. IT systems and infrastructure The business is dependent on efficient information technology IT systems. Any significant failure in the IT processes of our retail operations e. g. barcode scanning or supply chain logistics would impact our ability to trade. We recognise the essential role that IT plays across our operations in allowing us to trade efficiently and achieve commercial advantage through implementing IT innovations that improve the shopping trip for customers and make life easier for employees. We have extensive controls in place to maintain the integrity and efficiency of our IT infrastructure and we share systems from across our international operations to ensure consistency of delivery. Regulatory, political and economic environment We are subject to a wide variety of regulations in the different countries in which we operate because of the diverse nature of our business. Tesco may be impacted by regulatory changes in key areas such as planning laws, trading hours and tax rules as well as by scrutiny by the competition authorities who have been carrying out enquiries in the UK, Ireland and elsewhere. We may also be impacted by political developments and the economic environment in the countries in which we operate. We consider these uncertainties in the external environment when developing strategy and reviewing performance. We remain vigilant to future changes. As part of our day-to-day operations we engage with governmental and non-governmental organisations to ensure the views of our customers and employees are represented and try to anticipate and contribute to important changes in public policy wherever we operate. Activism and terrorism A major incident or terrorist event incapacitating management, systems or stores could impact on the Group's ability to trade. In addition to contingency plans, we have security systems and processes that reflect best practice. Pension risks The Group's pension arrangements are an important part of our employees' overall benefits package. We see them as a strong contributor to our ability to attract and retain good people. Since the implementation of IAS 19 there is a risk that the accounting valuation deficit which is recorded as a liability on the Group Balance Sheet could increase if returns on corporate bonds are higher than the investment return on the pension scheme's assets. The Group has considered its pension risks and has taken action by reducing risk in its investment strategy. Financial review The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions, fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and credit rating risks. These risks are managed as described below. The Group Balance Sheet position at 27 February 2010 is representative of the position throughout the year. Funding and liquidity The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, long and medium-term debt, capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases. The objective is to ensure continuity of funding. The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities and a strong credit rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. Tesco Group has a long-term rating of A3 with a negative outlook by Moody's and Aby Standard & Poor's. New funding of PS2.3bn was arranged during the year, including a net PS1.8bn from property transactions and PS0.5bn from long-term debt. At the year end, net debt was PS7.9bn last year PS9.6bn. 44 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Risks and uncertainties continued Interest rate risk management Our objective is to limit our exposure to increases in interest rates while retaining the opportunity to benefit from interest rate reductions. Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and collars are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Our policy is to fix or cap a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs of the Group excluding Tesco Bank. At the year end, PS5.6bn of debt was in fixed rate form 2009 - PS6.3bn with a further PS0.1bn of debt capped or collared, therefore 72% 2009 - 72% of net debt is fixed, capped or collared. The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate form. The average rate of interest paid on an historic cost basis this year, excluding joint ventures and associates, was 5.4% 2009 - 5.2%. Foreign currency risk management Our principal objective is to reduce the effect of exchange rate volatility on short-term profits. Transactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are hedged, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies and currency options. At the year end, forward foreign currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to PS1.083bn were outstanding 2009 - PS2.11bn as detailed in note 22. We hedge the majority of our investments in our international subsidiaries via foreign exchange transactions in matching currencies. Our objective is to maintain a low cost of borrowing and hedge against material movements in our Group Balance Sheet value. During the year, currency movements increased the net value of the Group's overseas assets by PS477m last year increase of PS480m. We translate overseas profits at average foreign exchange rates which we do not currently seek to hedge. Credit risk The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions across an approved list of counterparties of good credit quality. The Group's positions with these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored. Credit risk arising from Tesco Bank's unsecured lending is managed using all the normal credit assessment and collections and recoveries systems. In terms of liquidity risk Tesco Bank has implemented a conservative approach to the minimum amount of liquid assets its holds and to its Net Stable Funding Ratio. Insurance We purchased Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability protection from the open insurance market at 'catastrophe' level only. The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the business by using our captive insurance companies, Tesco Insurance Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the Republic of Ireland. Tesco Insurance Limited covers Assets and Earnings, while Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability.

        "Detailed Analysis of ROE": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is ROE increasing or declining?**  \n  The **ROE** has increased significantly from **-0.8119** (negative) in the previous year to **0.0160** (positive) in the current year, indicating a substantial turnaround in profitability relative to shareholders' equity.\n\n- **Is growth in ROE higher than that of competitors and the industry?**  \n  While the report does not provide explicit competitor or industry ROE data, the shift from a deeply negative to a positive ROE suggests the company has outperformed typical recovery trajectories. The business has stabilized and shown improving profitability, which likely outpaces many peers still affected by market challenges.\n\n- **Is growth persistent or temporary?**  \n  The growth appears to be **persistent** due to multiple strategic initiatives and operational improvements detailed in the report:  \n  - Strengthening the balance sheet by reducing indebtedness by **\u00a36.2bn**  \n  - Regaining competitiveness through price stabilization and improved customer service  \n  - Improved operating profit before exceptional items of **\u00a3944m** in the current year, up from **\u00a3940m**  \n  - Increased cash generation from retail operations by **39%** to **\u00a32.6bn**  \n  - Structural changes including the UK defined benefit pension scheme closure to a defined contribution scheme  \n  These factors suggest a sustainable improvement rather than a one-off gain.\n\n# Forecasts:\n- **Expected ROE next year:**  \n  Based on the current trajectory of profitability recovery, cash flow improvement, and balance sheet strengthening, **ROE is expected to continue increasing**, potentially reaching a range of **3% to 5%** next year, assuming continued market stability and execution of strategic plans.\n\n# Summary:\n- The company has demonstrated a remarkable recovery from a severely negative **ROE (-81.19%)** to a slightly positive **ROE (1.60%)** within one year, reflecting a fundamental turnaround.  \n- Key drivers include improved operating profit, better cash flow management, and strategic balance sheet restructuring, including debt reduction and pension scheme changes.  \n- The improvement is supported by operational enhancements such as price competitiveness, customer focus, and supplier relationship resets, indicating that the ROE growth is sustainable.  \n- Risks remain in the form of challenging market conditions, deflationary pressures, and competitive dynamics, which could constrain the pace of ROE improvement.  \n- Overall, the company is on a positive trajectory with a strong foundation for continued ROE growth in the near term.",
        "Detailed Analysis of ROE Drivers": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?**  \n  The **Assets Turnover** ratio decreased significantly from **5.21** in the previous year to **3.67** in the current year, indicating a decline in operational efficiency. However, the **Profit Margin** improved from a negative of **-9.22%** to a positive **0.25%**, showing a turnaround in profitability. This suggests that growth in ROE is primarily driven by margin improvement rather than efficiency gains.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  Based on the textual report, Tesco is operating in a highly competitive and deflationary market, with efforts focused on regaining competitiveness and rebuilding profitability. The **Profit Margin** is positive but very low at **0.25%**, and the **Assets Turnover** has declined, which may indicate below-industry-average efficiency. While margin improvement is promising, the efficiency ratio suggests the company may still lag behind peers in asset utilization.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year:** Given the strategic focus on improving sales volumes and operational leverage, but considering the current downward trend, **Asset Turnover** is expected to stabilize around **3.7 to 3.9**.  \n- **Expected Profit Margin next year:** With ongoing investments in pricing, customer service, and cost control, **Profit Margin** is forecasted to improve further to approximately **0.5% to 0.7%**.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The company shows a **strong improvement in Profit Margin** from a significant loss to a slight profit, which is the main driver for ROE improvement this year.  \n- **Assets Turnover declined noticeably**, indicating operational efficiency challenges or changes in asset base and sales mix.  \n- Tesco\u2019s focus on customer-centric initiatives and cost control is expected to **support further margin improvement**, while efficiency gains may take more time to materialize.  \n- Overall, margin recovery is the stronger driver, with efficiency lagging but expected to stabilize as the turnaround progresses.  \n- The financial ratios reflect a company in transition, moving from losses toward profitability but still facing efficiency hurdles in a competitive environment.",
        "Detailed Analysis of Risk": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Are risks increasing or declining?**  \n  Risks show a mixed trend; **financial risk** has increased from **0.84 to 1.2**, indicating heightened concern in this area, while **legal risk** remains stable at **0.61** and **tax risk** slightly declined from **0.56 to 0.55**. Overall, some risks are increasing, particularly financial, but others are stable or slightly declining.\n\n- **Is the number and severity of risks higher than competitors/industry?**  \n  The textual report points to significant efforts in risk management and enhancement of internal controls, reflecting responsiveness to prior challenges. The **NLP specificity** increased from **0.0719 to 0.0820**, suggesting more detailed risk disclosures, which may imply comprehensive risk coverage but does not directly indicate severity relative to competitors.\n\n- **Is sentiment increasing or declining?**  \n  Sentiment is inferred from **NLP financial, legal, and tax risk** indicators. The increase in financial risk sentiment (from 0.84 to 1.2) and stable legal risk sentiment (0.61) indicate a heightened cautious tone in financial matters but stable legal outlook. Overall, sentiment is somewhat more cautious or negative regarding financial risk.\n\n- **Is specificity increasing or declining?**  \n  **NLP specificity** increased from **0.0719 to 0.0820**, showing more precise and detailed risk disclosures in the current year, indicating improved transparency and clarity in risk reporting.\n\n- **Are complexity measures increasing or declining?**  \n  Complexity measured by **sentence length** and **sentence depth** has slightly declined: sentence length decreased from **30.66 to 26.74** words, and sentence depth from **6.51 to 6.47**. This indicates a marginal simplification in the presentation of risk information.\n\n- **How are sentiment, specificity, and complexity compared to competitors?**  \n  While direct competitor data is not provided, the increase in specificity alongside a manageable sentence length and depth suggests Tesco's disclosures are becoming clearer and more accessible relative to typical industry norms, which often feature complex and verbose risk sections. The more cautious financial sentiment aligns with the company\u2019s efforts to address prior financial challenges.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Is Gearing expected to increase next year?**  \n  Given the significant reduction in gearing from **4.31 to 3.53**, the company is likely to continue deleveraging. **Gearing is expected to decline or stabilize rather than increase next year**.\n\n- **Is Current Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The current ratio improved from **0.60 to 0.75**, indicating better short-term liquidity. With ongoing cash generation and working capital improvements, **the current ratio is expected to increase further**.\n\n- **Is Quick Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The quick ratio more than doubled from **0.15 to 0.34**, reflecting improved liquid assets relative to current liabilities. This positive trend supports a forecast of **continued increase in the quick ratio**.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- **Risks have shown a mixed trend with financial risk increasing notably, while legal and tax risks remain stable or slightly improved, indicating targeted risk areas for focus.**  \n- **Disclosure specificity has improved, reflecting enhanced transparency and more detailed risk communication, although complexity has slightly decreased, making reports easier to understand.**  \n- **The company has made strong progress in reducing gearing and improving liquidity ratios (current and quick ratios), supporting a stronger financial position and risk resilience moving forward.**",
        "summary": "- The company shows a **remarkable ROE improvement from -81.19% to 1.60%**, signaling a strong turnaround in profitability and capital efficiency.  \n- **Profit Margin increase to 0.25%** is the primary driver of ROE growth, reflecting successful operational and pricing strategies.  \n- However, **Assets Turnover declined to 3.67**, indicating efficiency challenges and potential underutilization of assets compared to peers.  \n- Significant **debt reduction of \u00a36.2bn** has lowered gearing from 4.31 to 3.53, strengthening the balance sheet and reducing financial risk exposure.  \n- Liquidity positions improved with **Current Ratio rising to 0.75** and **Quick Ratio more than doubling to 0.34**, enhancing short-term financial resilience.  \n- Financial risk sentiment increased (from 0.84 to 1.2), highlighting ongoing caution in financial management despite overall risk stabilization.  \n- Risk disclosures have become more transparent and accessible, with **NLP specificity increasing to 0.0820** and slightly simplified language, improving investor confidence in reporting quality.  \n- The company\u2019s turnaround is supported by sustained operational improvements, cash flow growth (+39% to \u00a32.6bn), and structural reforms like pension scheme changes, suggesting **ROE growth sustainability**.  \n- **Key concern remains the subdued profit margin and declining asset efficiency**, which may limit the speed of profitability gains relative to industry peers.  \n- **Expected ROE is forecast to increase to 3-5% next year**, with gearing likely to continue falling and liquidity ratios improving, underpinning a positive outlook."

We set out to get back to what Tesco has always done best: being the champion for customers: putting customers first: and taking small actions to make big differences. Since then, we have begun to transform our business - from how we are organised to the way we work with our suppliers and ultimately the way that we serve our customers. One of the most important changes we have made over the past year is to set out a new purpose for Tesco: 'Serving shoppers a little better every day. ' This purpose guides all our decisions and shapes every action we take. Alongside our purpose, we have recommitted to three values: Whenever a customer chooses to shop at Tesco, we want their experience to be better than expected and better than the last - from the quality of the offer to the thoughtfulness of the service. With the skills, expertise and dedication of our 476,000 colleagues worldwide, we are well placed to achieve this. By delivering our purpose, and staying true to our values, we can continue to build on the progress we have made this year. This has been a year of real change at Tesco. Our ambition now is to go further and do even more to reduce and simplify prices, improve ranges, continue to innovate and deliver excellent customer service. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 02 Introduction Serving shoppers a little better every day Visit www. com ar2016 to see how we built a temporary store in Carlisle Across the business, we have continued with our wide-ranging corporate renewal plans and I'm pleased to say that these are very much on track. Through making some difficult decisions and putting the customer at the heart of all we do, we are rebuilding the business. It was a difficult decision to sell our Homeplus business in Korea, but it was an important step in repositioning the finances of the Group by generating PS3.3bn of funds. The sale enabled us to take a significant step forward on our priority of strengthening the balance sheet. In addition, replacing the UK defined benefit pension scheme with a defined contribution scheme means we have a plan that is both competitive and sustainable for our colleagues over the long-term. Further information on the work that has taken place during the year can be found in our corporate governance section on page 28. The Board and I feel we have the right balance of skills, experience and backgrounds to support and challenge the management team. The recent appointments of Alison Platt, Simon Patterson and Lindsey Pownall as additional independent Non-executive Directors have further strengthened the Board. Between them, they bring a wealth of customer service, IT and supplier relationships experience and It has been a very challenging year for Tesco, but I remain extremely positive and confident about the future of this great business. Tesco is an iconic brand, a national institution and an enormous employer, so I'm conscious of the huge responsibilities, not just to our customers, colleagues and shareholders, but to all our other stakeholders, including our supplier partners. During the past year, there has been a renewed focus on corporate governance and the Board has spent a significant proportion of its time examining and strengthening our processes throughout the Group. Having a solid governance framework is key to rebuilding trust and transparency. we look forward to working with them to take the Company forward. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Dave Lewis and his senior management team for their continued hard work and dedication. Strong foundations have been laid since we began our turnaround and I believe that we have focused on the right priorities as we continue to rebuild and strengthen the business. A highlight of my year has been getting out into the business and meeting so many of our colleagues, both in the UK and overseas, and seeing the passion and enthusiasm they have for Tesco. During a recent visit to South East Asia, I was delighted to see the recognition Tesco is receiving as a very attractive employer. I want it to be recognised how hard our colleagues have worked during the past year and thank them for their commitment through difficult times. It is important that we get Tesco back to investment grade and paying dividends. We are a business of scale and complexity and have the resources to do a lot. But it will be our relentless focus on meeting customers' needs that will help us to achieve our goals for the long-term success of the Company for the benefit of all our stakeholders. John Allan Non-executive Chairman 03 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Other information Corporate governance Financial statements Strategic report Chairman's statement Strong foundations John Allan Non-executive Chairman Visit www. com ar2016 to hear more from John Allan on his first full year at Tesco In October 2015, we became the first - and still only - retailer in the UK to offer customers an immediate price match at the till with Brand Guarantee, so they never pay more for their branded shop if it's cheaper at Asda, Morrisons or Sainsbury's when they buy 10 or more different products. And just two months ago, we launched a range of exclusive new fresh food brands, which are available only at Tesco and at great prices. These are allowing us to give our customers even more choice in great value, fresh food all under one roof. International sales have also strengthened despite trading in challenging markets, driven by improvements across our offer. We have built up strong positive sales momentum throughout the year in both Europe and Asia. Our largest international business, in Thailand, performed particularly well, culminating in its highest-ever market share. Our transformation programme in Europe has accelerated growth and reduced operating expense. Elsewhere in the Group, Tesco Bank continues to give customers a unique banking offer. And in Tesco Mobile, our joint venture with O 2, we have a successful brand and a business recognised for delivering outstanding customer service. As a result, we have stabilised the business and we are on track with where we expected to be. Of course there is still more to do - but we are on the road to recovery and momentum is building across the business. Our business has always been at its best when we'five made customers our absolute priority. Over the past year, we have restored our total commitment to giving the best possible service to our customers. This is reflected in the new purpose we have set out for the business: serving shoppers a little better every day. This is guiding every action we are taking and has been instrumental in making the UK business competitive again. As well as investing in lower, more stable pricing and improved service and availability, we have reviewed and simplified every one of our food ranges and added thousands of extra colleague hours on the shop floor to improve customer service. On-shelf availability has reached record levels, ensuring customers can get what they want, when they want it. This has been a significant year for Tesco. We have delivered unprecedented change over the past 12 months as we have begun to transform our business. We have taken decisive, immediate action on the challenges we faced. In a very deliberate way we have made the changes needed to re-energise the operation. We have guided our efforts with the three priorities we set out in October 2014: 1. to regain competitiveness in the core UK business: 2. to protect and strengthen the balance sheet: and 3. to rebuild trust and transparency. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 04 CEO's statement Visit www. com ar2016 to hear more from Dave Lewis A year of significant progress Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive Our progress towards rebuilding trust in our brand has been led by the commitment and passion demonstrated by our colleagues. Wherever I travel in our business, I see uplifting evidence of this. I am often humbled at the lengths so many colleagues go to in order to help others. Over the past year, I'five spent a lot of time with colleagues in our stores and seen the commitment to serving our customers. Be it on the shop floor or behind the scenes, there are so many examples where colleagues are going the extra mile to serve shoppers a little better every day. Colleagues have faced unprecedented change, yet the resilience and empathy shown to customers and each other is unwavering. The examples are limitless: from the tiny things that make customers smile to the thoughtful acts that make their day. One of my favourite examples of dedication to our customers is the colleague who spent hours navigating heavy snowfall to hand-deliver shopping to a 96-year-old unable to receive her usual online delivery or to leave her house for groceries. And there are the community and charity projects we can really be proud of too. We'five made a new commitment to ensure all surplus food from Tesco stores in the UK goes to charity and not waste by 2017. Our work with Community Food Connection continues to redistribute surplus food from our stores to local charities to help feed those most in need and we have extended it to over 100 large stores, with plans to roll out to all large stores by the end of 2016. Our charity partnership with Diabetes UK and the British Heart Foundation is the first of its kind and on its way to raising our target of PS30m to promote healthy living. And customers have chosen specific community projects to receive PS11.5m raised from the sale of Tesco bags in the UK since October 2015, donated through Bags of Help - one of the biggest environmental improvement drives the UK has ever seen. As this report describes, we have made significant progress from where we were a year ago. The actions we'five taken to reaffirm our competitiveness in the UK, protect the balance sheet, and rebuild trust and transparency have stabilised our business. As a team, we are committed to serving shoppers a little better every day, in what remains a challenging, deflationary and uncertain market. We are confident that the investments we are making are leading to sustainable improvements for customers whilst creating long-term value for our shareholders. I am sure that it will be another busy year and I'm confident that with the customer at the heart of everything we do, we will continue to rebuild our fortunes as a business. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive By focusing on fixing the fundamentals of the shopping trip for customers, we have seen improving like-for-like trends in all our markets and positive like-for-like growth for the Group as a whole in the fourth quarter. Volumes and transactions are increasing across the Group as customers are buying more of what they need at Tesco. We are rebuilding profitability whilst continuing to invest in our offer for customers and have delivered Group operating profit 1 of PS944m this year, in line with expectations. The long-term health of our balance sheet will be determined by our continued ability to improve profitability and generate cash, and I am pleased to say that we generated PS2.6bn of cash 2 this year - before taking into account the Korean sale proceeds - a significant improvement on last year. We have also taken some important decisions that - whilst difficult - have enabled us to move more quickly towards protecting and strengthening our balance sheet. These include the transition from a defined benefit pension scheme to a defined contribution scheme. We have also carefully negotiated the buy-back of 70 stores out of sale and leaseback structures, removing some of the burden of increased lease commitments and rental inflation. 1 Group operating profit is shown before exceptional items. 2 Cash generated from retail operations. Corporate governance Financial statements Strategic report 05 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Other information food categories, reducing the total number of product lines by 18%. As well as making the range easier for customers to shop, this has helped us to increase on-shelf availability to record levels by providing more space for the products which are purchased most frequently. These changes have been delivered by working closely with our supplier partners. Together, we have moved to a more efficient and sustainable way of working, helping us to further reduce prices for customers. In total, in the year we have brought down the cost of an average weekly shop by over 3%. In addition, by removing inefficiencies in the supply chain, we have been able to provide up to two days' more freshness in our fruit and vegetables. As well as lower, more stable prices, customers want complete peace of mind that they won't lose out at Tesco - even if the products they wish to buy are available on promotion elsewhere. They also prefer simple, immediate value rather than vouchers. In October, we launched our unique Brand Guarantee, reassuring customers that if their branded shop could be found more cheaply elsewhere, we would take the money immediately off their bill. Over the course of this year, we have worked hard to regain our competitiveness - particularly in the UK. To do this, we first listened to our customers and understood what it was that they needed from their shopping trip. They highlighted three main themes: they wanted their shopping trip to be easier: they wanted better availability on the products that matter most, every day: and they wanted lower, more stable prices they can trust all of the time. Over the past year, we have responded. We simplified our store structures, investing in 9,000 more customer-facing roles in store. We have reviewed the range of products we sell in every one of our 33 Brand Guarantee If a customer's branded grocery shop is cheaper at Asda, Morrisons or Sainsbury's, when they buy 10 or more different products, we instantly take the money off the bill at the till. We even compare branded promotions, so customers can check out with confidence there and then. No vouchers, no waiting, no wondering if there's a better deal elsewhere. We'five introduced this because it's the right thing for customers - and we're very proud of it. The progress we have made is being recognised. We measure customer satisfaction through our Customer Viewpoint Survey - a weekly measure that captures direct customer feedback in every store. In total, we have seen an improvement of 5% in the proportion of customers rating overall service and colleague helpfulness as excellent, and every individual measure below this has also improved. The clearest sign that we are more competitive again is that more customers are buying more things at Tesco. We have seen sales volumes and weekly transactions improve throughout the year, generating annual positive volume growth for the first time in five years. Volumes were up 3.3% and transactions were up 2.8% in the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by our progress but we know that there is a lot more we can do and that we can continue to become even more competitive by putting the customer at the heart of every decision we make. 06 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Regaining competitiveness Turnaround priorities For more information visit www. com brandguarantee adopted a new approach to cash payments to suppliers as part of our efforts to build trusted and transparent relationships: and increased our ownership of freehold property, reducing exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift leases. We have begun to make a big cultural shift in the way colleagues think about the finances of the business, with a much improved understanding of the importance of cash. All colleagues are asked to think about the impact they can have on improving the cash flow in the business, whether that be through reducing slow-moving stock in our warehouses or making our shop floor operations more efficient. Our firm focus on generating cash from our trading activities and maintaining discipline in our capital expenditure will be key to making further progress in protecting and strengthening the balance sheet going forward. We have made significant progress towards our aim of protecting and strengthening the balance sheet this year, reducing our total indebtedness by PS6.2bn. A strong balance sheet gives us more flexibility to invest in improving the shopping trip for customers. We have taken a number of actions to strengthen our position: repositioned the finances of the Group through the sale of our Homeplus business in Korea, which itself reduced total indebtedness by PS4.1bn: provided sustainable benefits for colleagues and a greater certainty on future cash requirements by replacing the UK defined benefit pension scheme with a defined contribution scheme: improved the potential for medium-term returns by consolidating the Central European businesses: taken a much more disciplined approach to capital investment and delivered, as planned, a significant reduction in total expenditure: Property ownership Our long-term aim is to increase the ownership of our property and reduce our exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift inflation. In March 2015, we completed an asset swap with British Land, regaining sole ownership of 21 superstores and in February 2016, we regained sole ownership of 49 large stores and two distribution centres from Phoenix Life Assurance and the British Airways Pension Fund. These transactions increased our freehold ownership ratio in the UK & ROI by 6% to 47% and generated a saving in fixed-uplift and index-linked rent of PS115m per annum at current rental levels. We continue to evaluate opportunities to further reduce our exposure to indexed rent inflation. 07 Other information Financial statements Corporate governance Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Strategic report Protecting the balance sheet We also became the first UK retailer to publish payment terms with suppliers. The Supplier Network which we launched at the start of 2015 has now grown to more than 5,000 members, and we set up a special helpline for suppliers to solve any issues that may arise within 48 hours. Our latest Supplier Viewpoint measure of how suppliers view their relationships with Tesco recognises the positive impact of all these changes. The results show a significant improvement year-on-year, increasing from 5 1% to 68% in the UK and from 58% to 70% for the Group as a whole. We have also made a number of changes which aim to help shareholders and other stakeholders understand our performance. These include much greater alignment between the way we run the business internally and the way we report our results externally and a move to operating profit as our headline performance measure, adjusted only for any large and distorting impacts. Tesco today is a very different business. We are proud of how our colleagues and suppliers have responded to the changes we have made. Our customers are noticing the differences too - they're enjoying better service and buying more of what they need at Tesco. And our journey will continue, guided by our commitment to serve shoppers a little better every day. Sadly, trust in our brand has been eroded in recent years. Trust should never be taken for granted and it will take time and perseverance to restore it fully. We are working hard to rebuild that trust with our colleagues, customers, suppliers and other key stakeholders and want to build more open and transparent relationships. We are giving customers lower, simpler and more stable prices to ensure they can trust Tesco to deliver the best shopping trip at the best price. And having listened to customer feedback, we are redirecting promotional spend into shelf-edge prices. In addition, we have completely reorganised our relationships with suppliers. In October 2014, we drew a line under our past and started to reset the way we work. We refocused on new performance measures and retrained our teams. We have fundamentally changed the way we operate and have implemented significant initiatives that improve the way we work with suppliers and our commercial culture, and simplify how we buy and sell. We have completely changed our Product team structure, focusing on getting the offer right for customers and prioritising sales and total profit over margin rate. Dairy farmers The groundbreaking Tesco Sustainable Dairy Group, set up in 2007, continues to give farmers fair prices and deals for their milk. In our commitment to dairy farmers, all Tesco own-label standard-tier yoghurt is now made with milk sourced from Britain with the exception of those with protected origins - including authentic Greek yoghurt and French fromage frais. This has seen us increase the amount of British milk in our standard-range yoghurts from two-thirds to 100% and has increased the demand for milk from farms across the whole country. We have also extended our financial support for First Milk farmers who supply milk for our own-label cheese to help cover production costs throughout the winter and into the spring. 08 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Visit www. com ar2016 to see more about our supplier relationships Turnaround priorities continued Rebuilding trust and transparency Corporate governance 09 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Other information Financial statements Strategic report Our business is organised around the three pillars of Customers, Product and Channels.

We place them at the centre of everything we do to deliver our purpose - serving shoppers a little better every day. 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Business model Keeping it simple Product The offer we create for customers is developed by our Product team. Our ways of working in this team have been rewritten with an absolute focus on fair, transparent, mutually beneficial relationships with suppliers. The Product team work with our suppliers to source the best-possible range of quality products that meet and anticipate our customers' needs. Channels To bring the best products to customers, we work through a range of channels - from small shops to large shops and through our growing online business. As part of improving our offer, we are investing in making our channels even more efficient and convenient for our customers. Reinvest Our main focus is to improve Tesco for customers. We are committed to becoming more efficient and reinvesting some of the savings we make to improving the shopping trip. The reason for this reinvestment is clear: the better a job we do for customers, the more we will improve sales: the more our sales improve, the more we can reinvest. Customers Tesco exists to serve customers - and our business model has customers at its core. We listen to our customers and act on what is important to them to deliver the best shopping trip: price, service, range and availability.

We achieved positive like-for-like sales growth in both Asia and Europe in the second half, driven by improvements across our offer with a particular emphasis on price and fresh foods. We delivered market share gains in five of our seven international markets. In Central Europe, the restructure of the management team for Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia is complete and moves us from operating as four individual country teams to one single regional team. We are in the process of moving to an operating model which will create substantial buying and operational synergies and help us to fund further improvements in the customer offer. International profits increased by 11.4% at constant exchange rates to PS277m, with margin growth of 138 basis points between the first and the second half.

Full-year UK sales declined by 0.4 % on a 52-week basis, reflecting both an improving trajectory in our like-for-like sales performance and a declining contribution from net new store space, due to store closures. UK like-for-like sales, excluding VAT and excluding fuel, fell by 0.6 % in the year but improved over the course of the year, rising by 0.9% in the fourth quarter driven by a strong performance across all our store formats and product categories. High levels of deflation persisted due to our own price investments in addition to commodity price decreases. In the Republic of Ireland, we made a significant investment to ensure our customers receive the most competitive offer possible. Like-for-like sales performance turned positive in the fourth quarter for the first time since 2012. Our full-year UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items was PS505m, with margin growth of 81 basis points between the first and the second half. This improvement marks the next stage of our journey to rebuild profitability from the losses we made in the second half of 2014 15. We have made permanent reductions to our cost base, transformed the way we work with suppliers, started to generate leverage through increasing sales volumes and begun to improve productivity throughout our operations. 15 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Other information Corporate governance Financial statements Strategic report Segmental results continued Tesco Bank This year Year-onyear change Revenue PS955m 0.8% Operating profit before exceptional items PS162m 13.8 % Lending to customers PS8,542m 10.6% Customer deposits PS7,397m 7.0% Net interest margin 4.2% 0.0% Risk asset ratio 20.0% 1.2% Tesco Bank continues to offer customers a differentiated banking and insurance offer, with 7.6 million accounts at the year-end. Active customer account numbers have grown by 1.0%, supported by a strengthened customer proposition including higher value personal loan products, 95% loan-to-value mortgages and the removal of monthly current account fees. Customer lending increased by 10.6% to PS8.5bn, with strong growth in mortgage balances. Operating profit before exceptional items reduced by 13.8 % to PS162m. This decline was primarily due to the introduction of European Commission caps on interchange income from December 2015, following the initial reduction driven by MasterCard's agreement with the Competition and Markets Authority last April. The full-year effect of this change will be felt in the 2016 17 financial year. Risk-weighted assets have risen in line with lending and the Core Tier 1 ratio has improved to 16.6%.

In the current year, the net effect of exceptional items on operating profit is PS102m, with a mix of both charges and credits: An information technology impairment and asset write-off of PS 275 m, as we move towards a single online platform for customers and a net non-cash property impairment and onerous lease provision of PS 133 m, including write-downs of  and non-trading sites of PS 109 m. A UK & ROI net restructuring and redundancy charge of PS 126 m relates principally to store colleague structures and working practices changes and business rationalisation, and is partially offset by the release of a prior year provision. We generated net profits pre-tax of PS156m from property transactions. In order to increase our freehold ownership and reduce our exposure to indexed rent reviews, we regained sole ownership of 70 stores and two distribution centres in transactions with British Land in March 2015, and Phoenix Life Assurance and the British Airways Pension Fund in February 2016. In October 2015, we agreed the sale of 14 sites in the south of England to Meyer Bergman for mixed-use and residential development, generating cash proceeds of PS218m in the year. Following the closure of our UK defined benefit pension scheme in November, a non-cash actuarial credit of PS538m has been recognised, as all accrued deferred pension benefits now increase in line with the consumer price index, rather than the retail price index. This was partly offset by a PS 58 m charge related to the scheme closure, including a payment to members, equivalent to one week's pay and capped at PS500 per colleague, paid directly into a new defined contribution scheme. Last year, we recognised exceptional items of PS 6.7 bn, of which around PS 0.6 bn was linked to a direct future cash outflow. 16 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Visit www. com ar2016 to find PDF and Excel downloads of our financial statements Financial review continued Joint ventures, interest and tax Joint ventures and associates Losses from joint ventures and associates increased by PS 8 m to PS 21 m, due to a higher level of losses from our partnership with CRH in China in addition to a lower initial level of dunnhumby profitability following the restructure of our relationship with Kroger in April 2015. These impacts were partially offset by increased profits recognised on our UK property joint ventures. Finance costs and income This year Last year Interest receivable and similar income PS29m PS80m Finance income PS29m PS80m Interest payable PS 504 m PS 535 m Capitalised interest PS6m PS44m IAS 32 and 39 'Financial instruments' - fair value remeasurements PS 19 m PS 26 m IAS 19 net pension finance costs PS 155 m PS 134 m Finance costs PS 672 m PS 651 m Exceptional charge: Translation of Korea proceeds PS 220 m - Statutory finance costs PS 892 m PS 651 m Taxation Tax on profit before exceptional items was PS 8 m with an effective rate of tax for the Group of 3%. This tax rate is lower than the UK statutory rate primarily due to a lower book value than tax value of property assets disposed of in the year, partially offset by unrecognised tax losses. On a statutory basis, including an exceptional credit of PS86m relating to a release of provisions in respect of uncertain tax positions following settlement of a number of historic enquiries relating to years up to 2011, there is a tax credit of PS54m. The effective underlying tax rate for the 2016 17 financial year is expected to be around 30%. Interest receivable and other income decreased by PS 51 m to PS29m, due to reduced income from debt-hedging swaps. Finance costs increased by PS21m to PS 672 m. Interest payable includes an overall reduction of PS49m in interest costs on bonds and medium term notes, which was largely offset by the unwinding of the discount on onerous lease provisions. The prior year also included set-up costs relating to new credit facilities. Capitalised interest reduced by PS38m, reflecting a lower level of work-in-progress. Net pension finance costs of PS 155 m rose in line with the opening pension deficit, offset in part by a lower opening discount rate. An exceptional non-cash loss of PS 220 m arose on the translation of the proceeds from the sale of our Homeplus business in Korea, which are held in GBP money market funds in a non-Sterling denominated subsidiary. This does not represent any economic cost to the Group. Earnings per share Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items were 3.41p, down 17.6 % on last year despite a lower tax charge due to higher net finance costs. Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items and net pension finance costs were 4.97p, 9.1 % lower year-on-year. Statutory diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were higher than last year at 2.76p reflecting significant exceptional items in the prior year. 17 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Other information Corporate governance Financial statements Strategic report Pension In November 2015, we replaced our defined benefit pension scheme with a defined contribution scheme, providing sustainable benefits for colleagues and greater certainty on future cash requirements. On an accounting basis, the Group's net pension deficit after tax decreased from PS 3.9 bn last year to PS 2.6 bn at the year-end. This was driven by a recalculation of the deficit following the closure of the UK defined benefit scheme and an increase of 30 basis points in real corporate bond yields, leading to a corresponding increase in the discount rate used to measure our long-term liabilities. In accordance with the long-term deficit funding agreement with the Trustee of PS270m per annum in place since April 2015, a cash contribution of PS249m was made to the scheme. Following the significant reduction in future pension risk, by closing the defined benefit scheme, the Trustee is now working with its advisers and the Company to reduce risk further, by beginning to implement an asset derisking strategy. Discounted operating lease commitments Discounted operating lease commitments reduced by PS1.5bn in the year, including a PS0.8bn reduction arising from the sale of our Homeplus business in Korea. Protecting and strengthening our balance sheet Summary of total indebtedness This year Last year Movement Net debt excludes Tesco Bank PS 5,110 m PS 8,481 m PS3,371m Discounted operating lease commitments PS 7,814 m PS 9,353 m PS1,539m Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax PS 2,612 m PS 3,885 m PS1,273m Total indebtedness PS 15,536 m PS 21,719 m PS6,183m We have made significant progress over the course of this year to reduce our total indebtedness from PS 21.7 bn to PS 15.5 bn. In this measure of indebtedness, we include net debt, discounted lease commitments and our net pension liability as measured by IAS 19. Our firm focus on generating cash from our trading activities and maintaining discipline in our capital expenditure will be key to making further progress in protecting and strengthening the balance sheet going forward. Retail cash flow and net debt 1 This year Last year Cash flow from operations excluding working capital PS2,231m PS715m Increase decrease in working capital - impact from exceptional items PS 91 m PS1,805m - cash impact of new approach to supplier payments PS 231 m PS 1,073 m - underlying decrease in working capital PS672m PS413m Cash generated from operations PS2,581m PS1,860m Interest paid PS 422 m PS 609 m Corporation tax received paid PS125m PS 347 m Net cash generated from retail operating activities PS2,284m PS904m Cash capital expenditure PS 1,004 m PS 2,244 m Free cash flow PS1,280m PS 1,340 m Other investing activities PS543m PS253m Net cash used in from financing activities and intra-Group funding and intercompany transactions PS 854 m PS239m Net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents PS969m PS 848 m Include exclude cash movements in debt items PS4,219m PS 1,010 m Fair value and other non-cash movements PS 1,817 m PS 26 m Movement in net debt PS3,371m PS 1,884 m 1 Includes both continuing and discontinued operations. We generated PS2.2bn cash from continuing and discontinued retail operations and improved working capital by PS0.4bn. On an underlying and continuing operations basis, working capital improved by PS0.4bn driven by a PS0.3bn reduction in inventory with improvements evident in all areas of the Group and a PS0.1bn inflow from trade We completed three property transactions, regaining ownership of 70 stores and two distribution centres which reduced discounted lease commitments by a further PS0.6bn. With some of our lease agreements, we have an option on a specific date to buy back the property or to buy back the equity of our joint venture partner at market value. As we are not obliged to make lease payments after the buy-back date, we do not include these as part of our indebtedness. If we were to include them, it would increase our lease commitments by PS2.6bn. balances, including an improvement from an increased focus on up-front unit price. Additionally, there was a PS0.3bn inflow generated by our discontinued business in Korea up to the point of disposal. The overall reduction in working capital also includes the net impact of exceptional items of PS 0.1 bn and the first half PS 0.2 bn outflow relating to the new approach to cash payments to suppliers which we outlined last year. Interest paid was PS187m lower than last year as three medium term notes which matured in the prior year were refinanced at lower rates. In addition, timing differences resulted in a lower number of instalments requiring payment in 2015 16 than the prior year. Cash tax was a net refund of PS125m, which arose primarily as tax losses made in the 2014 15 financial year were carried back to offset against taxable profits from 2013 14. Cash movements of PS4.2bn in debt items primarily reflect the proceeds from the sale of our Homeplus business in Korea, which have been placed in short-term investments. Fair value and other non-cash movements include PS1.5bn of debt acquired when we regained sole ownership of 70 stores and two distribution centres. 18 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Financial review continued Property UK & ROI International Group Property 1 - fully owned - Estimated market value PS13.3bn PS6.4bn PS19.7bn - Net book value 2 PS12.6bn PS5.0bn PS17.6bn % net selling space owned 52% 71% 61% % total property owned - by value 3 47% 75% 54% 1 Stores, malls, investment properties, offices, distribution centres, fixtures and fittings and work-in-progress. 2 Property, plant and equipment excluding vehicles. Capital expenditure This year Last year UK & ROI PS0.7bn PS1.3bn International PS0.3bn PS0.4bn Tesco Bank - PS0.1bn Group PS1.0bn PS1.8bn Capital expenditure was PS1.0bn, a decrease of PS0.8bn year-on-year, with lower spend in each region. Group capital expenditure in 2016 17 will be around PS1.25bn including an increased spend to refresh UK stores and an accelerated store-opening programme in Thailand. Our long-term aim is to increase the ownership of our property and reduce our exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift inflation. The March 2015 asset swap with British Land and February 2016 transactions with Phoenix Life Assurance and the British Airways Pension Fund, through which we regained sole ownership of 70 large stores and two distribution centres, enabled us to increase the proportion of freehold property in the UK & ROI by 6% to 47%. These transactions resulted in a combined saving in fixed-uplift and index-linked rent of PS115m per annum at current rental levels. The sale of our property assets within the disposal of our business in Korea drove the year-on-year reduction of PS3.2bn in the estimated market value of fully-owned property across the Group to PS19.7bn at year-end. This valuation gives an estimated surplus of PS2.1bn over the net book value, with our Group freehold ownership percentage now 54% by value and 61% by selling space, an increase of 5% by value and 3% by selling space on last year. This estimated market value excludes our share of property joint ventures. Including this, the valuation would increase by PS0.2bn, net of the debt in the joint ventures. The Group operating lease charge reduced by 10% in the year to PS1.2bn and we continue to evaluate opportunities to further reduce our exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift rent inflation. Based on current rent, around three-quarters of our UK lease charge relates to fixed-uplift or index-linked rental agreements. Outlook We have made good progress over the last year. We are continuing to invest in our customer offer in order to improve our competitiveness in what remains a challenging, deflationary and uncertain market. This will be reflected in the pace of improvement in profitability in the current year, particularly in the first half. We are increasingly confident that the actions we are taking are leading to sustainable improvements for customers and will result in a continued improvement in profitability and the creation of long-term value for shareholders. This year, we closed more selling space than we opened, leading to a net reduction of 1.2 m sq. Internationally, we reduced net space by 0.4 m sq. ft. of existing space in Asia and 0.3 m sq. ft. of closures in Europe more than offset our reduced opening programme. 19 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Other information Financial statements Corporate governance Strategic report Alan Stewart Chief Financial Officer We have performed a robust and systematic review of those risks that we believe could seriously affect the Group's performance, future prospects, reputation or its ability to deliver against its priorities. We maintain a Group Risk Register of the principal risks faced by the Group. Our risk management process is operated throughout the Group. All business units perform regular risk assessments that consider and assess the Group's principal risks and specific local risks pertinent to the market in which they operate. This process ensures a consistent approach to the assessment of risk across the Group as well as informing the Group risks from a bottom-up perspective. The content of the Group Risk Register is considered and discussed through regular meetings with senior management and reviewed by the Executive Committee and the Board. As part of a wider and ongoing process to enhance our risk management activities and capabilities, we have refreshed the process by which Tesco evaluates and reports principal risks and uncertainties. We show the alignment of our risks to our priorities by principal risk in the table on page 25. In some cases a change of emphasis in the risk reflects both the external and internal business environment, including wider economic factors facing our Group that have also been considered as part of this process. Key to risk movement Risk increasing No risk movement Risk decreasing This development of our risk process has resulted in the inclusion of liquidity risk as a principal risk in this section. In our Annual Report 2015, this risk was included as part of a separate financial risks review, now set out in Note 22 on page 123 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016. Our process for identifying and managing risk is set out in more detail on page 47 of the corporate governance report. The table on page 25 sets out our principal risks, their movement during the year and examples of controls and mitigating factors. A significant process for the enhancement of our internal control environment is under way. The risks identified do not comprise all of the risks associated with our business and are not set out in priority order. Additional risks not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse effect on the business.

Individual members, reporting to the Group Chief Executive, are accountable for specific risks Principal risk Risk movement Key controls and mitigating factors Customer proposition Failure to listen to our customers and to understand the changing marketplace leads to a loss of market share as customer purchases are made with competitors. We are unable to build and sustain loyalty resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results. Link to priorities We are addressing the challenge of changing customer wants and increased customer choice as a result of heightening competitive activity. The customer need is central to our decision-making. We have developed strategic plans to enhance our understanding of our customer needs. Customer insight supports development of customer-focused strategies across each market and we have developed strategic customer profiles to understand specific market expectations. We have invested in the customer experience by increasing colleague hours on the shop floor and by providing further customer service training for colleagues across all stores. We continue to invest in availability and price as well as running our Feet on the Floor programme - whereby non-store colleagues spend a day on the shop floor to ensure customer focus is maintained. Transformation of economic model The transformation of our economic model does not allow us to respond to changes in the external economic environment, nor does it progress sufficiently quickly to maintain or increase operating margin, to generate sufficient cash to meet business objectives. This may result in an adverse impact on the business and shareholder confidence. Link to priorities We are in the process of transforming our business and how we operate to drive improvement and better performance. Significant transformation programmes are being undertaken across the Group, including organisational design, data strategy, reset of supplier relationships, cost reduction and people & capability. There is Executive Committee and Board overview of key strategic initiatives to improve sales and margin, and to reduce cost. Periodic sales margin planning and forecasting activity are reviewed by Group and local finance functions. Liquidity Business performance does not deliver cash as expected: access to funding markets or facilities is restricted: failures in operational liquidity management: Tesco Bank cash call: or adverse changes to the pension deficit funding requirement, create calls on cash higher than anticipated, leading to impacts on financial performance, cash liquidity or the ability to continue to fund operations. Link to priorities We have a strong focus on improved liquidity management and have taken a number of steps to address this. The funding plan and its key elements e. g. debt issuance, cash resources, available credit facilities and cash flow forecasting are subject to regular executive review, supported by rolling liquidity updates and key financial metrics. Treasury and debt-related policies covering UK and International markets are in place and periodic reviews of the Going Concern and Longer Term Viability Statement is undertaken by the Audit Committee and the Board. Following the significant reduction in future pension risk by closing the UK defined benefit scheme, we are implementing a derisking strategy to further reduce pension risk and better match our cash flows. Specific activities have been undertaken to reduce our debt-level with enhanced cost control measures in place. Further information on these risks can be found in Note 22 on page 123 of the financial statements. Whilst Tesco Bank is financially separate from Tesco PLC, there is a regular review of Tesco Bank's risk appetite by Tesco Bank Board and the Tesco PLC Board. This sets out Tesco Bank's key risks, their optimum ranges, alert limits, controls and tolerance limits and ensures ongoing awareness of any potential risk to Tesco PLC. Competition and markets We do not have an effective, coherent and consistent strategy to respond to our competitors and changing markets, resulting in a loss of market share and failure to improve profitability. Link to priorities We face the ongoing challenge of a changing competitive landscape and price pressure across most of our markets. Executive oversight and ownership of business plans provide strategic direction for the Group with plans regularly reviewed and challenged. Dedicated Board strategy days are held to develop and challenge strategic direction. The use of market scanning and ongoing competitor analysis provides insight, an ability to anticipate market movements and develop an effective proposition. We remain closely aligned with local trade associations, governments and other policy makers across our markets. We have realigned our individual European businesses to sit within a simplified Central European structure under a single management team to provide greater clarity and a consistent strategic approach. 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 25 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Other information Financial statements Strategic report Corporate governance Principal risk Risk movement Key controls and mitigating factors Brand, reputation and trust Failure to manage our brand means we are unable to consolidate loyalty and rebuild trust, creating a perception among customers, colleagues, communities and suppliers that result in a loss of market share or unfavourable effects on our ability to do business. Link to priorities We are working to ensure that we rebuild trust and transparency across our stakeholders through initiatives such as price transparency, Brand Guarantee and the launch of new fresh-food brands. This helps to ensure that our brand perception reflects the values that we demonstrate. Brand guidelines have been updated to provide Group-wide consistency over the use of the Tesco brand. Group commercial and corporate affairs policies and procedures have been updated. Communications, media relations and corporate responsibility plans are in place and include internal and external stakeholder engagement. There is a Group Corporate Responsibility Committee that oversees corporate responsibility activity. The Code of Business Conduct has been refreshed with specific guidance over brand, social media and communications, ethical trading and the establishment of a tone at the top with defined consequences in the event of non-compliance. Technology A significant failure of IT infrastructure or key IT system results in loss of information, inability to operate effectively and or financial or other regulatory penalties. Link to priorities Our IT landscape requires further investment in core infrastructure and data centres, as well as to support the store environment. Controls include a technology strategy outlining a number of approved technology policies and procedures. The Technology leadership team provides central governance across major project approval, configuration changes, application updates and the development of new systems. We are increasing our investment in IT with a fully-funded development plan covering a range of back office and customer systems. Technology assessments are performed on an ongoing basis to identify further areas of need and opportunities for improvement. Data security and data privacy Failure to maintain control over customer, colleague, commercial and or operational data leads to a loss of data, either through deliberate targeted action or inadvertent error. The misuse of personal data, for example without the customer's consent or retaining for longer than is necessary, may also result in reputational harm, regulatory investigations and potential fines. Link to priorities We operate a large number of disparate IT systems, some of which are legacy systems and we hold significant amounts of sensitive data in a number of locations. Our systems are secured with access controls, while regular vulnerability and penetration testing provides additional security. Compliance assessments are executed across UK and international business units against the information security policies. We are strengthening our data-related controls as part of a significant IT security improvement programme. The strengthening includes enhanced information security policies and governance, review of defence measures against attacks and continued migration away from unsupported systems. A Group-wide, comprehensive privacy compliance programme is being developed, which covers governance, risk assessment, policies and processes, training, incident management, monitoring and review. This is designed to drive the right behaviours and ensure obligations are met with regards to the handling of personal data. Regulatory and compliance Failure to comply with legal or regulatory requirements relating to our business activities, resulting in reputational damage, fines or other adverse consequences including criminal penalties and consequential litigation, adverse impact on our financial results or unfavourable effects on our ability to do business. Link to priorities Our regulatory and legal landscape continues to evolve in all of our locations, and across each of our businesses. There is a risk of breach of existing legal or regulatory requirements, and of not adapting our business as demands change. There are specific actions under way to address matters identified last year relating to commercial income and supplier relationships. The Group-wide Code of Business Conduct has been refreshed, with specific compliance programmes existing around key legislation e. g. UK Bribery Act, built around a risk and compliance model. Colleagues in high-risk areas receive annual training and a communications programme supports ongoing awareness of Code and other regulatory risks. Leadership teams are trained on their regulatory duties and receive management data on compliance risks and breaches. Groceries Supply Code of Practice GSCOP compliance is addressed in a number of ways, including through a GSCOP audit and monitoring programme and the appointment of a Code Compliance Officer. Equivalent legislation will be issued in ROI in 2016 and steps are being taken to prepare for this. There is an externally managed whistleblowing service across the Group for colleagues and suppliers except Thailand, where it is internally managed and a supplier helpline for the anonymous reporting of inappropriate conduct. Tesco Bank's Board oversees Tesco Bank's compliance with regulatory requirements. 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 26 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Principal risks and uncertainties continued Principal risk Risk movement Key controls and mitigating factors Safety We do not meet safety standards in relation to workplace or product, resulting in death, injury or illness to customers, colleagues, or third parties. Link to priorities We continue to focus our efforts on controls to ensure workplace and product safety. For workplace safety, controls include Group safety policies and procedures, Group safety standards and rapid escalated incident-reporting to the CEO. Implementation is driven by a dedicated Group Safety function, which provides advice to the Group on safety matters across geographies. A framework for standardised safety risk assessments has been developed. An extensive programme of technical product testing and reporting is in place with country teams responsible for the delivery and implementation of product safety policies and systems. We are proud to make the results of our provenance-testing publicly available. A supplier audit programme is in place to monitor product integrity and labour standards, which includes unannounced specification inspections of supplier facilities and products. People Failure to attract, motivate and retain the most talented colleagues and develop the required culture, leadership and behaviours to meet our purpose, resulting in an inability to achieve our business objectives. Link to priorities Our people are our most valuable asset. We continue to manage and consider diversity and inclusion as well as colleague engagement. Standardised recruitment policies and processes have been established and a Boardsponsored people strategy is being implemented to attract and retain the best people. Diversity and inclusion are key elements of our people agenda. Remuneration policies and succession planning are subject to periodic benchmarking to ensure they remain appropriate for the Group. We provide ongoing opportunities for personal and professional development through our established leadership development and graduate programmes. 'Our Tesco' and 'What Matters To You?' initiatives allow us to connect, listen and respond to our colleagues. The consolidation of our UK offices into a single campus and the restructure of our Central European businesses has created an environment that fosters improved communication and collaboration between teams. Tesco Bank Continual and progressive changes in the regulatory environment in which the Bank operates could impact the level of capital and liquidity that is expected to be held. Regulatory uncertainty could also impact the future earnings profile of the Bank. Link to priorities The Bank actively manages its response to proposed regulatory changes and has a track record of adapting activities in advance of the implementation of regulatory change. There is Bank Board reporting throughout the year in line with relevant regulatory requirements, with updates to the Tesco PLC Audit Committee by the Bank CFO Audit Committee Chairman. A member of the Tesco PLC Board is also a member of the Bank's Board. The Bank has formed good working relationships with the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and is also a member of the British Bankers Association. Through these relationships, the Bank is able to adopt a proactive approach to engaging in proposed regulatory change. The Bank monitors proposed regulatory guidance and changes during consultation and implementation phases. As a result, the Bank would expect to have sufficient time to respond and adapt its funding and business plans as appropriate. The Bank has a defined risk appetite which is approved and reviewed regularly by both the Bank's Board and the Tesco PLC Board. The risk appetite defines the type and amount of risk that the Group is prepared to accept to achieve its objectives and forms a key link between the day-to-day risk management of the business, its strategic priorities, long-term plan, capital planning, liquidity management and stress testing. Adherence to risk appetite is monitored through a series of ratios and limits. 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 Longer Term Viability Statement The Directors have assessed the viability of the Company over a three-year period, taking into account the Company's current position and the potential impact of scenarios arising from the principal risks set out above. Based on the results of our testing of a number of severe but plausible scenarios, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due during this period. The Directors have determined that a three-year period is an appropriate timeframe for assessment given the dynamic nature of the retail sector and is in line with the Company's strategic planning period. We have based our assessment on our current long-term plan, which makes assumptions relating to: the prevailing economic climate and global economy: the structural challenges facing our sector: and the costs associated with delivering our strategy. Against this we have conducted sensitivity analysis and modelled a range of scenarios including reverse stress-testing based on the materialisation of principal risks, including market and competition, economic and technology failure, which would result in declining sales and increased margin pressures. Our principal risks are identified through our risk management process, which relies on our judgement of risk likelihood and their potential impacts, whilst also understanding the existing mitigations and developing further appropriate controls. The principal risks faced by the Company are recorded on a Group Risk Register, which is considered and discussed through regular meetings with senior management and reviewed by the Executive Committee, relevant sub-committees and the Board. We have considered our principal risks and risk appetite against our strategic objectives. This Strategic report, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, has been approved and signed on behalf of the Board.

        "Detailed Analysis of Risk": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Are risks increasing or declining?**  \n  Risks are generally increasing. This is evident from the rise in **NLP financial risk** from **0.54** to **1.06**, **NLP legal risk** from **0.5** to **0.73**, and **NLP tax risk** from **0.74** to **0.85**. The textual report also highlights ongoing risks in financial services, regulatory environment, and operational risks, which suggests heightened risk awareness.\n\n- **Is the number and severity of risks higher than competitors/industry?**  \n  The textual report positions Tesco\u2019s risks as carefully managed and mitigated, but the **NLP risk metrics** indicate a moderate increase in severity. Without direct competitor data, it\u2019s inferred that Tesco faces typical sector risks, though the increase in financial and legal risk scores may indicate a relatively higher exposure than some peers.\n\n- **Is sentiment increasing or declining?**  \n  The sentiment indicated by **NLP financial, legal, and tax risk scores** is increasing, showing more emphasis on risk topics in the current year compared to the previous year.\n\n- **Is specificity increasing or declining?**  \n  **NLP specificity** has slightly declined from **0.0870** to **0.0858**, suggesting that the risk disclosures have become marginally less detailed or less focused on specific risks.\n\n- **Are complexity measures increasing or declining?**  \n  **NLP sentence length** has increased slightly from **27.02** to **27.40**, indicating somewhat longer sentences. However, **sentence depth** decreased from **6.49** to **6.38**, implying a slight reduction in syntactic complexity. Overall, complexity has remained relatively stable with a slight shift toward longer but less complex sentences.\n\n- **How are sentiment, specificity, and complexity compared to competitors?**  \n  Without direct competitor data, Tesco\u2019s **increased sentiment** paired with slightly **lower specificity** and **stable complexity** suggests a cautious but comprehensive approach to risk disclosure. The company appears to emphasize risk matters more, possibly reflecting heightened risk management focus relative to peers.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Is Gearing expected to increase next year?**  \n  Given the reduction in gearing from **1.90** to **1.66**, **Gearing is expected to decline or remain stable**, indicating improved financial leverage management.\n\n- **Is Current Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  With the current ratio declining from **0.73** to **0.67**, there might be continued pressure on short-term liquidity, so the **Current Ratio is forecasted to remain stable or slightly decline** unless corrective action is taken.\n\n- **Is Quick Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The quick ratio decreased significantly from **0.27** to **0.17**, indicating lower liquid asset coverage; thus, the **Quick Ratio is expected to stay low or decline further** without liquidity improvement measures.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- Tesco is experiencing **increased financial, legal, and tax risks** as reflected in the rising NLP risk scores, although the company maintains robust risk controls and governance per the textual report.  \n- The **slight decline in specificity** of risk disclosures suggests a marginally less detailed approach, but the company compensates with longer sentences indicating comprehensive explanations.  \n- Financial leverage is improving as shown by a **decline in gearing**, but liquidity concerns persist with both **current and quick ratios decreasing**, signaling a need for improved short-term asset management.  \n- Overall, Tesco presents a **transparent but cautiously more risk-aware profile**, balancing increased risk sentiment with steady complexity and disclosure transparency.",
        "summary": "- **Return on Equity (ROE) increased slightly to 16.06%**, reflecting improved profitability and efficient equity use, signaling steady value creation for shareholders.  \n- Growth in ROE is driven by dual improvements in **Assets Turnover (5.13)** and **Profit Margin (4.36%)**, indicating enhanced operational efficiency and profitability, which is a very positive performance driver.  \n- Tesco\u2019s **ROCE rose to 12.9%**, reinforcing strong capital efficiency relative to peers in a challenging retail sector.  \n- The company\u2019s **continuous dividend growth for 27 years** underscores a persistent and sustainable earnings power supporting investor confidence.  \n- Financial leverage is improving with **Gearing reduced from 1.90 to 1.66**, signaling prudent balance sheet management and reduced financial risk.  \n- However, **liquidity ratios are declining** with the **Current Ratio falling to 0.67** and **Quick Ratio dropping to 0.17**, highlighting potential short-term liquidity pressures that investors should monitor.  \n- Risk sentiment is rising, evidenced by increased **NLP financial, legal, and tax risk scores**, indicating heightened exposure but mitigated by strong governance and risk controls.  \n- The slight decline in risk disclosure specificity paired with stable sentence complexity suggests a comprehensive yet cautious approach to risk communication.  \n- Strategic initiatives in international expansion, multi-channel retailing, and management refreshment are expected to sustain and potentially accelerate ROE growth, with **Expected ROE exceeding 16.1% next year**.  \n- Overall, Tesco presents a well-balanced profile of consistent profitability improvement, operational strength, and manageable risks, though short-term liquidity requires attention."

Laurie McIlwee has taken on responsibility for Group Strategy in addition to his role as CFO. Andrew Higginson and Lucy Neville-Rolfe will continue in their roles as CEO Retail Services and Executive Director Corporate and Legal Affairs respectively. There have also been a few changes to the Non-executive members of the Board this year. Rodney Chase CBE retired from his position as Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director in July. Patrick Cescau, who has served on the Board since February 2009, has replaced Rodney as Senior Independent Director. Charles Allen CBE and Dr Harald Einsmann, who had both served on the Tesco Board since February 1999, also retired in July and were replaced by Stuart Chambers and Gareth Bullock. Stuart, formerly CEO of NSG Group and Pilkington plc, has replaced Charles as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. Gareth, former Group Executive Director of Standard Chartered PLC, has joined the Audit Committee. I would like to thank Charles, Harald and Rodney for their excellent advice and important contributions over a combined 30 years' service, and also formally welcome Gareth and Stuart, who bring with them a wealth of international experience and new expertise in financial services, further adding to the overall strength of the Tesco Board. Dividend I am delighted to report that we have again increased our dividend - for the 27th consecutive year. The Board has proposed a final dividend of 10.09p per share, taking the full-year dividend to 14.46p. This represents an increase of 10.8% on last year's full-year dividend, which is in line with the growth in underlying diluted earnings per share at constant tax rates. Community This year, we donated over PS64 million to charity - again meeting our target to donate the equivalent of over 1% of our profits to charities and good causes. We'five made further progress towards our goal of becoming a zero-carbon business by 2050. This year we have reduced emissions from our baseline portfolio of buildings by 7.7%. Our people Our growth over the past year is a direct result of the dedication, passion and hard work of our people - a team which is now over 492,000 strong. I'm delighted that our share ownership incentive schemes are helping our staff to get their own personal stake in the business. This year 216,000 employees shared a record PS105.5 million through our Shares In Success scheme. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our people for their ongoing commitment to providing the best possible service for our customers. David Reid Chairman I am pleased to report another good set of results in what has been a challenging year in some of our markets. After 14 years as CEO, Terry Leahy announced his retirement in June and, as part of our long-term succession plan, Philip Clarke replaced him at the helm in March 2011. Terry is undoubtedly one of the leading businessmen of his generation. Under his leadership we have more than quadrupled our sales and profits, expanded into 13 countries outside the UK and entered new markets such as online retailing and financial services. On behalf of everyone at Tesco and all our shareholders, it is a privilege to thank Terry for his unrivalled contribution to the success of the business. There could be no better person to lead us going forward than Philip Clarke. Philip has worked at Tesco throughout his career, spending many years in Retail and Commercial. He joined the Tesco Board in 1998 and, as part of his role as Asia, Europe and IT Director, has been at the heart of many of our most important developments and operational improvements in recent years, such as entry into China, Turkey and India and the introduction of the Tesco Hindustan Service Centre HSC - our global services arm. I set the Nominations Committee the objective of delivering a seamless succession and I am delighted with the outcome. The handover process from Terry to Philip was very smooth. I have every confidence that under Philip's leadership, Tesco will go on to achieve even greater success in the future. In order for the Tesco Board to better reflect the global nature of our business, provide more focus on key areas of performance and deliver on our immediate objectives, we made additional changes in March 2011. Tim Mason has become Deputy CEO and Chief Marketing Officer in addition to his role as President and CEO Fresh & Easy. TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 3 OVERVIEW Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Chairman's statement Building on our success I'm pleased to report that Tesco has once again achieved a good set of results with good sales, profit and earnings per share growth, despite challenging conditions in some of our markets. I am particularly pleased with our progress on return on capital, where we have seen ROCE grow strongly to 12.9%, representing an important first step towards our 2014 15 target of 14.6%, with further increases to come. In the UK, we have an outstanding core business. It made progress in the year but some aspects of our performance can improve. Stronger sales momentum here is a key priority and I am confident that the focus and energy our new UK leadership team is bringing to the business will see a return to form in the months ahead as Tesco tries to do its bit to help customers who face pressure on their household budgets. The increasing scale and competitiveness of our international businesses are now driving strong growth in sales, market share, profits and returns, supported by the generally improving global economic environment. We have built some excellent springboards for future growth, and whilst there is still work to do, particularly in the United States, I am delighted with our performance in Europe and Asia, where I expect further strong growth this year and beyond. We have set six immediate team objectives against which we intend to be judged. First, keeping the UK strong and growing: second, we want to be outstanding internationally, not just successful: third, as the combination of stores and online becomes compelling for customers, we aim to become a multi-channel retailer wherever we trade: fourth, we will deliver on the potential of retailing services - of which Tesco Bank is a big part: fifth, by applying Group skill and scale we will give our customers even more value and increase the competitive advantage to our businesses: and finally, to deliver higher returns on capital employed for shareholders. Also, as part of our commitment to communities, we want to widen our contribution from tackling climate change to broader aspects of sustainability. Vision and strategy Tesco is a business built around customers and staff, high-quality assets around the world and multiple opportunities for growth. My job is to build on this legacy - for all our stakeholders. Going forward, there will mostly be continuity. We have a sound strategy, a strong team and the period of highest risk with the diversification of the business is now behind us. However, there will also be some changes, because we know that we can do some things better and because, as customers change, so must Tesco. Importantly, there will be no change to the foundations of our business: our core purpose - to create value for customers to earn their lifetime loyalty - and our Values - no one tries harder for customers and treat people how we like to be treated. I have set out a new vision for the future of the business. I would like Tesco to be seen as the most highly valued business in the world. Valued not only by our customers, but also by the communities we serve, our staff and our shareholders. We will win locally by applying our skills globally. The key word here is 'locally'. Seven years of running our businesses in Asia and Europe has taught me that all retailing is local. But increasingly we are utilising the skill and scale of the Group to benefit the performance and competitiveness of each of our businesses around the world. I have inherited a great legacy and I am really excited about the future. In the end of course, we know it's all about performance: that's what matters and that's what we aim to deliver. 4 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review We will be a modern and innovative company. We'll stay ahead of the curve, anticipating changes and adapting for the sake of our customers and staff. We are, and we will remain a growth company. We will continue to pursue growth in all parts of the business - in the UK, internationally, in services and across general merchandise, clothing and electricals. More detail on our new vision can be found on pages 6 to 13. To put this vision into practice, our strategy is evolving - with a slight change in emphasis which builds on the success of our previous five-part strategy that has served us so well over the past 14 years. So our strategy will now have seven parts. Much of it will be familiar but with some important new additions around being a multi-channel retailer, creating highly valued brands and building our team: To grow the UK core To be an outstanding international retailer in stores and online To be as strong in everything we sell as we are in food To grow retail services in all our markets To put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do To be a creator of highly valued brands To build our team so that we create more value More details on our strategy can be found on page 14. Management structures We'five made some changes to our management structures in order to equip the business to deliver our strategy and vision. This means CEOs for each of our main areas of focus - the UK, Asia, Services including Tesco Bank, Europe and the US - being supported by the integrating functions such as IT and Finance to leverage the skill and scale of the Group. The biggest part of this change was in the UK, which now has its own CEO and management board for the first time. This will bring more focus and energy to our largest business. Of course, structures don't manage companies, people do and I'm confident that at all levels we have the very best team working hard to deliver the best shopping trip for our customers. Philip Clarke Group Chief Executive TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 5 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements T o be the most highly valued MOST HIGHL Y VALUED BY: TO BE THE MOST HIGHLY VALUED BY: The customers we serve Our core purpose is to create value for customers to earn their lifetime loyalty. This objective sits right at the heart of our business as one part of our Values - 'No one tries harder for customers'. We know that we are already valued by our customers across our markets. In the UK, for example, we have the most loyal customer base of the major grocery retailers and in South Korea, Homeplus was awarded South Korea's Most Admired Company award in October 2010. The communities in which we operate For Tesco to be considered a force for good, we must be a good neighbour and a responsible member of society. This is why Community is part of our balanced scorecard approach to running our business - and why each market has its own Community Plan, with promises relating to the environment, communities, responsible sourcing, healthy living and jobs and careers. Our loyal and committed staff We know that if we look after our staff, they will look after our customers. Work can be a large part of our lives so our people deserve an employer who cares. That's why one of our Values is 'Treat people how we like to be treated'. We are committed to providing opportunities for our people to get on and turn their jobs into careers, and across all of our markets we offer a wide range of competitive benefits. In the US, for example, we pay at least 75% of medical, dental, prescription and vision costs. 69% of employees across the Group who completed our annual staff survey said that they find their work interesting. Our shareholders As the owners of the business, it's crucial that our shareholders value Tesco highly. Shareholders want a good return on their investment and that's what we will continue to deliver for them. We have over 200,000 shareholders, including a large number of pension funds. We offer sustainable, profitable growth from a combination of a strong core UK business and exposure to rapidly growing emerging markets. Over the past decade our total shareholder return TSR has outperformed the FTSE 100 by 53.2% and we'five delivered dividend growth for the past 27 years - the longest record of consecutive increase by any FTSE 100 company. 69% of employees across the Group who completed our annual staff survey said that they find their work interesting OUR VISION survey said that they find their work inte of wh sta th T o learn more about our vision and strategy: http: ar2011. com businessreview ourstrategy TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 7 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Tesco Clubcard All retailing is local. And Clubcard is one of the ways in which we can be responsive to local customer needs. In addition to rewarding customers for their loyalty, Clubcard provides us with insight from millions of customer transactions. From this we can develop tailored ranges, promotions and marketing by country or region - in fact right down to the individual customer via their Clubcard mailing. The knowledge and expertise of operating Clubcard was developed in the UK but has now been rolled out to a further 11 countries across the Group, with more members in Asia and Europe than at home in the UK. F&F We'five been successful at exporting a number of our brands internationally, tailoring them to local trends, needs and price ranges. F&F is a good example of how one of our brands has spread globally and won locally. We're bringing the benefits of our Group skill and scale to our buying and sourcing operations, helping to reduce costs and improve quality. In Central Europe for example, 95% of our clothing supplier base is the same as Ireland and the UK, even though to win in each market, we adapt our range to local trends, tastes and climates. F&F is now in ten of our markets and is the market-leading clothing brand in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. We also opened our first stand-alone F&F store in Prague this year. World-class training for national talent We know that to be a successful international retailer we need to combine deep local knowledge with global experience - this is why all of our international management teams are a mixture of nationals and people from our UK business. In addition, the experience of working internationally helps us attract, retain and develop our people - over a fifth of our directors are currently working outside their home country. Our Academy supports the development of both operational expertise and leadership excellence. Management courses are developed based on global best practice and then used to train teams in each local market. Our first dedicated Academy centre will open in Seoul - serving Asia - in July. OUR VISION T o learn more about our vision and strategy: http: ar2011. com businessreview ourstrategy TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 9 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Online retailing Customers expect to be able to shop where and when they want - as shopping habits have changed over the years we'five changed too. As we'five grown from a UK supermarket chain towards becoming an international multi-channel retailer we'five continued to innovate every step of the way. We were viewed as pioneers when we first launched an online grocery business 11 years ago. It's now the largest, most profitable business of its kind in the world. Using their smartphones, our customers can now scan the barcode of grocery items, order online and have their shopping delivered to their home. A leader in green retailing As a global business we know that we can make a real difference in tackling climate change - cutting our own emissions, working with suppliers and helping customers to cut their carbon footprint. We also understand that successful businesses need to be green to grow. Our 2050 target to be a zero-carbon business will be achieved through improved efficiency and by generating our energy from renewable sources. We're making good progress - over the past year we have reduced emissions from our baseline portfolio of buildings by 7.7%. We have pledged to help customers cut their carbon footprints by 50% by 2020. We have worked with the Carbon Trust and other stakeholders to develop a universal carbon footprint label which describes the emissions associated with each product. Since January 2008, we have carbon labelled more than 500 everyday products in the UK and have started to label products in South Korea, helping our customers to make greener choices. 500 Products carbon labelled since 2008 OUR VISION T o learn more about our vision and strategy: http: ar2011. com businessreview ourstrategy TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 11 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Business review UK: an outstanding business We have more than doubled sales and profit in our UK business over the last decade, cementing our position as clear market leader. Yet there remain significant opportunities for further growth. The UK has the lowest grocery retail space per capita of any country in the EU: only 54% of shoppers are able to reach a Tesco Extra within 15 minutes and we have only a small share of the convenience sector. Beyond grocery we'five developed a strong position in many other categories such as clothing, electricals and entertainment. But with a market share of around 4% in the non-food sector there is still plenty more to come. 12 4% UK sales growth over the last decade International growth More than two-thirds of our profit growth now comes from markets outside the UK. We opened our first international Tesco store in 1995: today we're in 13 markets across Europe, Asia and North America. 65% of our floorspace is now outside the UK, and our businesses in Asia and Europe are collectively the same size as the whole of Tesco was 11 years ago. We'five built successful, diverse businesses across the world, yet the journey is only just beginning. We'five already developed market-leading, highly profitable businesses in a number of countries. In South Korea, our largest international business, Homeplus, already generates PS5 billion revenue. Yet, if Homeplus were to grow to have the same proportion of the total retail market that Tesco has achieved in the UK, the business would be more than three times as large as it is today. During our first decade of international expansion we'five proved that we are able to develop profitable and market-leading businesses in many of our markets. Over the next decade, in addition to further expanding our established overseas businesses, we are focused on delivering growth in three of the world's largest economies: China, India and the United States, which between them offer decades of future growth. New services Customers trust Tesco and appreciate that we provide value, simplicity and good service. This is our approach with everything we sell and is the key to our success in following the customer into new areas such as banking and telecoms. Tesco Bank in the UK now has over 6.5 million customer accounts and generates annual profits of PS264 million. We'five made particularly good progress in credit cards. In February, one in eight of all MasterCard and Visa credit card transactions in the UK were made on a Tesco credit card. As we broaden our offer - with mortgages launching this year - we aim to become the best choice for all our customers' banking needs. We have also established a successful Telecoms business. Tesco Mobile now has over 2.5 million customers. By focusing on value and good service and through our 194 Phone Shops we are changing the way that customers buy phones, services and accessories. com businessreview ourstrategy TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 13 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements The business review analyses the performance of the Tesco Group in the financial year ended 26 February 2011. It also explains other aspects of the Group's markets, results and operations, including strategy and risk management. The Directors present their Annual Report to shareholders on the affairs of the Group and Company, together with the audited financial statements of the Company for the 52 weeks ended 26 February 2011. Some elements of the strategy remain unchanged. The goal 'to grow the core UK business' is as relevant today as it was in 1997. The UK is the largest business in the Group and a key driver of sales and profit. There are many opportunities for further growth and so we will continue to grow the UK core. Another of our original goals was to be a 'successful international retailer'. In 1997, our international businesses generated 1.8% of the Group's profits. Today they represent 25% and we're now either number one or number two in eight of our 13 markets outside the UK. So we're already 'successful'. Our next step is to be an outstanding international retailer in stores and online. In 1997, we were largely a food retailer so we set ourselves the challenge of becoming 'as strong in non-food as in food'. As our business has grown and we offer an ever wider variety of products to customers, the term non-food no longer does justice to all the products and services we sell. We now aim to be as strong in everything we sell as we are in food. Our services businesses have come a long way since we first included in our strategy the desire 'to develop retailing services'. Today these parts of Tesco generate PS583 million profit, representing 16% of the Group total. To date this has been largely UK-focused, but as many of our international businesses have now established well-known brands in their local market, it is time to expand our ambitions and aim to grow retail services in all our markets. In 2007, we added a fifth element to our strategy to underpin our commitment to communities and the environment. We'five updated this objective slightly by emphasising our responsibilities in these areas. Our goal is to put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do. There are two new strategic goals, both of which reflect the way that Tesco has developed over the last decade and our areas of emphasis for the future. The first is to be a creator of highly valued brands. Our brand has evolved from a logo above a few stores in the UK to a multitude of store, product and service brands across the world. Building brands gives our business more meaning with our customers. On one level, this relates to our Retail brands such as the Tesco brand itself, but it also refers to our Product brands such as F&F and Technika and our Pillar brands such as Finest and Value. Our final goal is to build our team so that we create more value. As our business continues to grow and diversify we need more leaders to run the many substantial business and support functions within the Group. Our leaders not only have an important role today, but also have a responsibility to help build a bigger and better team for the future. Our progress in these areas is reviewed over the following pages. Business review Our strategy In 1997, Tesco set out a strategy to grow the core business and diversify with new products and services in existing and new markets. This strategy enabled us to deliver strong, sustained growth over the past 14 years. We'five followed customers into large expanding markets in the UK - such as financial services, general merchandise and telecoms - and new markets abroad, initially in Europe and Asia and more recently in the United States. In order to reflect changing consumer needs and the increasingly global nature of our business we'five evolved our strategy. The strategy now has seven parts and applies to our five business segments - the UK, Asia, Europe, the United States and Tesco Bank. 14 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Our business Our sevenpart strategy T o grow the UK core 16 22 T o be an outstanding international retailer in stores and online 26 T o be as strong in everything we sell as we are in food 30 T o grow retail services in all our markets 34 T o put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do 38 T o be a creator of highly valued brands 42 T o build our team so that we create more value TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 15 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements T o grow the UK core In our market-leading UK business, we have delivered a solid performance by keeping our focus on the customer, providing them with great value, choice and service. Clubcard Clubcard is our unique customer loyalty programme - our way of saying 'thank you' to our customers. It is now more popular than ever before, with active membership of over 15 million customers, compared to 13 million at the start of 2008 9. Customers who say they would prefer a Tesco to open in their area rather than a competitor store cite Clubcard as the main reason. Clubcard continues to be a significant driver of growth for our business and ensures that our customer base continues to demonstrate considerably higher levels of loyalty than our competitors. For most of 2010, Clubcard was the number one reason behind customers switching to us for their weekly shop. Customers have responded well to our new and up-weighted Clubcard initiatives. Three million customers participated in the Big Clubcard Voucher Exchange promotions held in August and November, which provided new ways to get more value from vouchers through categoryspecific deals. We have seen 60% growth in Rewards through our Partner Reward Scheme as customers recognise that Clubcard is about more than just earning money-off vouchers and that they can use points as currency in other areas of their lives. 1% Trading margin 3.8% Trading profit up 5.5% Sales up Introduction and market context The UK economy is in recovery but consumers have been under pressure this year due to a combination of high petrol prices, food and utility inflation and, more recently, the VAT increase. As a result, we're experiencing a period of unusually subdued industry growth. Excluding petrol, like-for-like growth in the industry has been significantly lower than last year. Against this backdrop, our UK business has delivered a solid performance. Total UK sales were PS44.6 billion, growing by 5.5%, which was ahead of the market. UK trading profit increased by 3.8% or by 6.4% before the effects of our sale and leaseback programme: principally the additional rents incurred. 16 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Growing the UK core No. 1 reason for customers switching to T esco CLUBCARD Clubcard continues to play an important role in earning customers' loyalty. We'five continued to invest in Double Points, we have introduced the Big Clubcard Voucher Exchange and we have expanded our Partner Reward Scheme. TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 17 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements REAL FOOD This year, we launched the Tesco Real food magazine. The monthly publication, which is available for free in our stores, provides customers with recipes, cooking tips, information on healthy eating and updates on new Tesco products. The magazine has become Britain's largest food title with a circulation of 1.2 million. Real food can be found online at www. With over 1,000 recipes and a food blog, the site gets 2.2 million page views per month. We'five also launched an innovative service for customers to receive great recipes via SMS. Customers are able to send a text message including two or three key ingredients and in return receive an automatic reply with a delicious recipe suggestion. 2,000 Over 2,000 new and improved products 1 0m Self-service transactions per week Stores New space has continued to drive sales growth. We'five opened over 200 new stores in 2010 11 and have a strong opening programme for the coming year. We have seen particularly strong growth in our convenience format, Tesco Express, with over 150 new stores and have achieved significant share gain in the convenience sector. This growth follows our work to tailor the range and promotions in Express to better suit the needs of our customers locally. Overall last year, we had 80 million more customer visits to our Express stores than in 2009 10. We have also refreshed or extended over 400 stores this year, receiving a great response from customers. For example, we'five added 7,000 sq ft to Wembley Extra, expanding our World Foods offer to meet better the needs of customers in the local area - the store is outperforming by 16% and over three-quarters of customers have told us that it is greatly improved. Range Our customers tell us that quality is increasingly important to them, it is not simply about finding the cheapest product. We have stepped up our emphasis on quality, with accelerated product development, leading to the introduction of over 2,000 new and improved food products. The increasing importance of quality for customers is also supported by the strong performance of our Finest range, which has outpaced the growth of other areas of our food range, with a 6.3% increase in sales this year. Many of our customers want to buy locally sourced products to support their local communities. We are always looking to expand our network of good local suppliers and to support them in building capacity to grow their businesses and supply us at a national level. We have five dedicated regional buying offices throughout the UK and in 2010 11 we increased sales of local products to PS1 billion, up from PS850 million in 2009 10. Tesco is the first UK retailer to launch a website dedicated to local foods, at www. We'five also worked more closely with farmers and growers to increase the amount of British produce in-store. This year, for example, we sold over 40% more British apples and pears. Price We remain focused on delivering the best value to all customers. The launch of Essential Savings in May was an investment in lower prices on the everyday products which our customers buy. We have introduced more multi-buys into the promotion programme to help customers save money. We also launched our Price Check initiative this year. Price Check enables customers to check the price of individual products and the total price of their shopping online. When we compare our customers' baskets with Asda's prices, nearly 80 per cent are the same price or cheaper in Tesco than they would be in Asda. Together these initiatives have helped us to maintain our leading position in a highly competitive market and to encourage customers to switch to Tesco throughout the year. title with a circulation of 1.2 million. 18 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Growing the UK core 1,000 Recipes on www. com Availability We have maintained high levels of availability this year through a number of programmes, from better promotional forecasting through to improved processes for monitoring availability in our stores. Our customers are benefiting from this work and have noticed the improvements - customer satisfaction with availability is at a record high - up 7% from last year and 13% from the year before. We have had great success with our automated weather forecasting technology which accurately adjusts store orders and deliveries based on customers' shopping habits in different weather conditions in 14 individual regions nationwide. We have also delivered a comprehensive plan to improve availability in our Express convenience stores, resulting in a 25% reduction in the number of out-of-stock items in the evenings. Service We work continually to improve service for our customers. We have trained over 80,000 staff this year in Every Little Helps skills for checkouts, supporting them to deliver helpful, friendly and efficient service. We also know how important it is for our customers to be able to choose the checkout that is right for them, so we are working to create the ideal configuration in each of our stores based on the local customer profile. This year, we have continued to use technology to help deliver great service. Our self-service checkouts provide customers with a quick and easy option and currently account for over ten million transactions per week. Our trials of Scan as you Shop, which uses hand-held technology, have gone well too. STAFF TRAINING We have trained 80,000 staff this year in Every Little Helps skills for checkouts. EVERY COMMENT HELPS Our 'Every Comment Helps' initiative encourages customers to give instant feedback on their shopping trip - including both the customer service they receive and the range of products we offer. Customers are able to share their feedback via text or email. Over 20,000 of the comments that we have received have been compliments about the service which our customers have received. This is testament to the hard work and commitment of our teams in-store. All of the comments have helped us to understand what's important to our customers and identify where we can do better. We are putting plans into action based on the feedback we receive so that we can do even more to improve our customers' shopping experience. 19 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements T esco UK: a growth business Delivering for customers Our success begins with delivering a great shopping trip in every store. Behind our Every Little Helps philosophy lie world-class systems and processes for property, buying, distribution, ordering, store operations and marketing. We also have the widest range of any food retailer including the leading own label range.

Climate change As a retail business, we know that we can make a real difference in tackling climate change - cutting our own emissions, working with suppliers and helping customers to cut their carbon footprint. In our UK business, we have led the work on climate change and for the second year running, we have reduced our absolute emissions - this year by 5% despite space growing by 7% as well as significantly reducing emissions from our baseline portfolio of buildings. Outstanding financial performance We operate a balanced scorecard approach to managing the business, based on the 'Steering Wheel' segments: Customer: Community: Operations: People: and Finance. In order to achieve sustainable profitable growth over the long term we must deliver on all these priorities. This approach means that we have delivered consistently strong financial performance each year, which has led to remarkable performance when looking over a number of years - showing the cumulative effect of consistent growth. The chart below shows the consistency and speed with which we have grown relative to our major UK peers. Tesco in the UK is an outstanding business. We are clear market leader in food retail with the broadest customer appeal, widest range of formats, market-leading systems and processes and the world's leading customer loyalty programme - Clubcard. We are the largest private employer in the UK, offering market-leading pay and rewards to our staff, and we're a leader in tackling climate change. We also generate outstanding financial performance with the highest sales densities, profit margin and return on capital of any company in the sector. 20 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Growing the UK core Revenue PSbn 00 01 98 99 02 03 06 07 04 05 08 09 10 11 96 97 40 35 25 20 30 15 10 5 Asda J Sainsbury Tesco Wm Morrison GROWTH vs COMPETITORS Source: Tesco and Deutsche Bank Research including estimates for 10 11.

Future growth The UK offers significant opportunities for growth for Tesco - in grocery, in non-food categories and in services. The UK grocery market is mature, but far from saturated. The UK has the lowest grocery space per capita of any country in the EU and only about a third of that of the United States. 0.25 0.21 0.29 0.28 Spain Poland 0.34 Germany 0.35 0.35 Italy France 0.58 US UK Netherlands sq m per capita GROCERY RETAIL SPACE PER CAPITA Source: Verdict Research space per capita, Economist Intelligence Unit population data. An important indicator of the scope for future growth of grocery space in the UK is that when new stores open the impact on existing stores is minimal. We track very closely every store opened in the UK - by Tesco and our competitors - and the impact of these new stores on Tesco's sales has remained consistently below 1% of our total sales for many years. The performance of our own mature stores opened in recent years is exceeding business plan forecasts and our profit margin and return on capital in the UK continue to strengthen. There is significant opportunity and demand for Tesco to grow its store network - for example, only 54% of UK shoppers are able to reach a Tesco Extra within 15 minutes. Convenience stores form another important segment of the grocery market. Traditionally a fragmented market, Tesco was the first of the major retailers to develop a convenience format on a national scale with Tesco Express. We now have 1,285 Express stores but this still represents only a small market share in the convenience segment and we have many years of future growth. In addition to food and other grocery items such as household and toiletries, Tesco has developed a strong offer in categories such as electricals, clothing and entertainment. In these 'new' general merchandise areas we only have around a 4% market share in a large fragmented market. With a large and loyal customer base, the leading store network and a strong online platform, we have a tremendous springboard from which to grow our market positions in these segments. We have also followed our customers into services such as banking, insurance and telecoms, building on our brand reputation for value, simplicity and great service. We have built successful businesses, such as Tesco Bank and Tesco Mobile, which are already making a significant contribution to sales and profits. There remains enormous potential for future growth in these areas, through expanding our range of products particularly in banking with mortgages and current accounts and by increasing our penetration of Tesco's 15 million Clubcard customers. TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 21 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Overall, our businesses across Asia, Europe and the United States have had a strong year, with improvements in sales, profits and returns in most markets. Introduction and market context Most of our markets have seen steady economic improvement over the past year and in some cases - particularly in Asia - sharp improvement. Countries hardest hit in the downturn - in particular Hungary, Ireland and the United States - have been slower to recover, although even there we are now seeing signs of improvement. A particularly encouraging feature of our performance in Asia and Europe has been excellent market share growth, with many of our businesses seeing strong growth in both customer numbers and like-for-like sales. We have resumed a faster pace of new space opening now that economic conditions are generally improving. We opened 6.5m sq ft of gross new space in 2010 11, compared with 5.1m sq ft in 2009 10 and plan to open a further 8.4m sq ft during the current year. Asia Our businesses in Asia have delivered another good performance leading to increases in sales and profits - supported by improving like-for-like sales growth, a useful contribution from new stores and further benefits from our acquisition in South Korea in 2008. As economies in Asia recover, we are seeing improving sales trends. Our performance was helped by favourable exchange rate movements but nevertheless profits grew by almost 18% at constant currency rates. Our businesses in South Korea and Thailand opened 56 and 119 stores respectively and delivered excellent sales and profit growth during the year as these economies rebounded sharply from recession.

TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 23 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements ANSHAN In October, we opened our fourth Lifespace mall - our largest so far - in Anshan, China. Over 600,000 customers flow through our four Lifespace malls each week. We plan to have up to ten malls open by the end of the year. In China, we are pushing ahead with our expansion plans, opening a further 19 stores in the year, including five Express stores. Our investments in equipping the business for faster growth, combined with our store roll-out being slower than planned, meant that we made a small overall loss in the year. After a sharp contraction in 2009 the economy in Malaysia has also recovered well over the past year. Our business has delivered very good sales and profit growth driven by continued investment for customers in prices, promotions and Clubcard. In Japan, falling supermarket industry sales are providing a challenging background for our operations and the business continued to make modest losses. We were one of the first businesses to respond to the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011 with a corporate donation of PS50,000 through our partnership with the Red Cross. Our early plans in India are continuing to progress well. Our local management team is helping our franchise partner, Trent, to develop its Star Bazaar hypermarket operation. Our Asian markets offer an exciting long-term growth opportunity and will be a key focus for our future international expansion, both in our established markets and in China. We have continued to invest through the downturn to ensure that we are in an even stronger position as the economic recovery continues. This year we plan to open 5.1m sq ft of new selling area. We have also continued to make good progress in developing strong brands in our leading Asian businesses with further expansion of Clubcard and our retail services businesses.

Today we are a sophisticated multiformat - and moving to multichannel - retailer with 354 stores and we employ over 23,000 people. In just a decade we have grown from two shops to become the second largest retailer in the country and we're closing in on the number one position. And there is plenty more to come with significant potential for growth. The organised modern retail trade in South Korea still represents a relatively small proportion of the total market - just 54% of total retail sales. We are already the market leader in the rapidly growing grocery home shopping sector and have recently launched our general merchandise website. We're also using our admired brand, strong store network and large customer base to develop our retail services offer. Together with delivering outstanding financial performance, we are aiming to be the most respected corporate brand in South Korea and we'five already been awarded South Korea's Most Admired Company award. 21.5% Asia sales growth Revenue excludes VAT and the impact of IFRIC 13. 24 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW T o be an outstanding international retailer Europe Our operations in Europe have delivered record results and strong growth in sales, profits and margins. Recovering economies generally helped but key to this performance was the striking improvement in the competitiveness of our local businesses, which won market share rapidly. We have invested for customers through lower prices, sharper promotions and Clubcard, funded by strong productivity and substantial early benefits of our pan-European sourcing. The resulting strong sales growth has driven an improvement in profitability and margins. Sales growth varied across the region but all markets saw sharply improved like-for-like sales growth compared with 2009 10, with a good contribution also coming from new space. In Ireland, like-for-like growth in the year was significantly stronger, and although it was broadly stable during the second half, the two-year trend has continued to improve. Despite a decline in consumer confidence resulting from political and economic uncertainty and the continued fall in disposable income, our business has continued its strong relative performance with impressive market share gains. Our business in Poland had another good year, with good growth in sales and profits despite a period of subdued consumer sentiment following the Smolensk tragedy. In Hungary economic conditions and consumer confidence remain challenging but despite this our business made solid progress. Growth in the Czech Republic has been supported by the successful launch of Clubcard - with over 10% of the population already enrolled. A particularly strong performance in Slovakia with double-digit like-forlike sales growth - has led to a further increase in our market share over the last year, further consolidating our market leadership. As the economy in Turkey has continued to recover, we'five resumed a faster rate of expansion - opening 21 new stores, including ten hypermarkets - helping to support strong sales growth. With the improving economic outlook we are stepping up the rate of new store opening. Some 2.6m sq ft of new space was opened in the year, with a programme to add a further 2.9m sq ft of new space across the region in 2011 12.

Although there is clearly some way to go, with these key elements moving in the right direction, we plan to accelerate the rate of new store openings to around 50 in the current year. With the improvements in our distribution centre and manufacturing campus productivity, we now expect to break-even with around 300 stores rather than the 400 we originally anticipated. Our losses increased in the year as a consequence of the initial costs of integrating our two dedicated fresh food suppliers, 2 Sisters and Wild Rocket Foods, and exchange rate movements. These businesses have now been fully integrated with our existing kitchen operations, with substantially improved financial performance, product quality and service levels. We expect losses to reduce sharply in the current year as strong growth in like-for-like sales continues and improved store operating ratios start to deliver shop-door profitability.

TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 25 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements T o be as strong in everything we sell as we are in food We'five continued to grow sales and expand our offer in general merchandise, clothing and electricals and we have a great opportunity to do much more. Introduction and market context Our general merchandise, clothing and electrical businesses have continued to grow, despite the challenges of weak demand in some of our important markets. We have seen some strong key category and market share performances, which have helped compensate for the effects of cautious consumer spending in these more discretionary areas. In order to align with our new structures, we will going forward define non-food as general merchandise, clothing and electricals excluding health & beauty and household. Overall Group sales in this category rose 8.8% during the year to PS10.3 billion. In the UK, high petrol prices and increases in VAT have had a significant impact on discretionary consumer spending. Many high street retailers have suffered from declining sales and have issued profit warnings. Tesco has fared better - and maintained market share - but we haven't been spared the impact of subdued demand. In the UK, general merchandise, clothing and electricals sales grew by 0.4% to PS5.3 billion. General merchandise sales growth was affected by a smaller component of extension selling space in this year's new space programme, with extensions providing just 10% of new space. In our international markets the picture varies considerably by country. Most of our markets in Europe and Asia saw strong growth in general merchandise as the economic recovery took hold during the year, although a number of markets - such as Ireland and Hungary - remain challenging.

UK Improving the performance of general merchandise in the UK is one of our key priorities. Our aim is to offer our customers the same great quality, price and range in our general merchandise offer as they would find with their Tesco grocery shop. The focus is on delivering in three key areas with the aim of improving the general merchandise shopping trip for our customers: investing in making the ranges more aspirational: enhancing the shopping experience with specialist advice: and developing our multi-channel capability. Investing in making the ranges more aspirational We have invested in and expanded our general merchandise ranges to provide greater appeal to our customers. Our offer is already good but there is much more we can do - in particular by offering more aspirational products, not just everyday basics. In electricals, we were the first UK supermarket to stock the Apple iPad and the Amazon Kindle - two of the most sought-after technology products on the market. Keeping in tune with changes in technology and responding quickly to offer our customers the latest electrical innovations is central to our strategy and to building our reputation as a leading retailer in everything we sell. Enhancing the shopping experience with specialist advice We are investing in our people so that we are able to support and advise our customers when they are making big ticket purchases such as TVs or mobile phones. For example we have 194 Phone Shops offering customers impartial advice on phone packages and accessories. In over 200 of our largest stores, we have Tesco Tech Support teams, made up of staff specifically trained to help customers with technical queries on electrical items from TVs to cameras and satellite navigation systems. The additional advice helps customers get the right product for their individual needs, supporting a reduction in product returns. Alongside our in-store teams, we have a free electrical helpline for our customers, manned by fully trained engineers, and a dedicated Tech Support website. Developing our multi-channel capability Our multi-channel approach makes it easy for our customers to shop in a way that suits them - online, in-store or from catalogues. Customers can browse in a catalogue, order online and then collect in-store or they can order in-store and have the goods delivered to their home. This year, over 40% of Tesco Direct electrical purchases have been made online and picked up in-store through our Click and Collect service. We'five listened to our customers and adapted by expanding our range. We have increased the number of products available through Tesco Direct to around 23,000, but we need to do much more in order to compete with the wider ranges offered by other leading online retailers. In 2009 10, we launched our clothing site at www. The website, which combines our F&F ranges alongside some other well-known brands, has been extremely popular with customers. We are currently the fastest growing online retailer in the clothing, footwear and accessories market. INTERNATIONAL SOURCING In order to get the best priced and highest quality products for our customers, we source many food, clothing and general merchandise goods globally and buy many products directly from producers and manufacturers. Through our Group Sourcing operations, headquartered in Hong Kong above, we can ensure: better products: confidence in where and how they are made: cheaper costs: the cheapest source of products for all countries: competitive advantage: on range and quality versus market competitors: and knowledge sharing: best practice in how we source, buy, make and move products. This year, we sourced directly more than PS4 billion worth of food and general merchandise products at retail value. 28 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Strong in everything we sell Europe In Europe, general merchandise, clothing and electricals sales were strong, reflecting an overall improving consumer background and a strengthening offer in our stores. Clothing in Central Europe had a successful year with a 9% year-onyear growth in total sales. We are now the clothing market leader in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. Building on the success of the F&F brand, we have introduced our F&F Blue and F&F Basics sub-brands to provide our customers with a greater range to choose from. Our first stand-alone F&F store also opened successfully in Prague last year, highlighting the appeal of the brand in the Czech Republic. In Central Europe, our trio of mid-market MY department stores showcase our general merchandise, clothing and electricals ranges including well-known brands such as Levis, FCUK and Disney. Our flagship MY Narodni store in Prague and our stores located in Liberec and Bratislava are traditional multi-floor department stores with open layouts and a full range of product categories at multiple price points. In the year, all stores made strong progress in like-for-like sales growth with our brands such as F&F and Go Cook competing well against more established luxury brands. Our F&F clothing brand launched in South Korea and Thailand this year and the early response from customers has been excellent. SPORTS SHOPS Our Sports Multishops in South Korea have increased sales of sporting goods in these stores by over 60% with great customer feedback. Asia We have seen strong general merchandise sales growth in our Asian businesses - which are predominantly hypermarket operations. We saw particularly pleasing increases in electrical products, with double-digit growth in Thailand and over 30% in China. Our F&F clothing brand launched in South Korea and Thailand this year and the early response from customers has been excellent - a very good example of the skill and scale of the Tesco Group being applied across our global network. Last year we opened our first three Sports Multishops in Homeplus stores in South Korea. These innovative sports zones are designed to meet growing customer needs for sporting goods, in a one-stop shopping environment. Sports Multishop presents our customers with a wide range of highquality branded sporting goods, a specialised bicycle shop, a golf shop and over ten sports and outdoor brand shops, such as Nike and Adidas, in a single 15,000 sq ft location. Sports Multishop has increased sales of sporting goods in these stores by over 60% with high customer penetration. We will open Sports Multishop in ten more stores this year, with plans for further roll-out thereafter. GOING THE EXTRA MILE IN EUROPE This year we began the remodelling and conversion of some of our older hypermarkets across Central and Eastern Europe. We'five listened to our customers and are making a number of enhancements to our stores to improve the shopping trip. We'five extended our range by introducing over 5,000 products, introduced product-specialist employees to improve service, and provided a better shopping environment through the introduction of conforming layout, fixtures and fittings. We're also adding many of the complementary services such as Phone Shop, Opticians and Pharmacy to provide our customers with a wider range of general merchandise products. We'five achieved very strong sales improvements across the eight Extras completed so far - with an average uplift of 16%. These refits are delivering particularly marked uplifts in general merchandise categories, including clothing and electricals. TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 29 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements T o grow retail services in all our markets This year we'five made progress in our retail services businesses: tesco. com, Tesco Bank, Telecoms and dunnhumby - our consumer research business. We'five been investing for the customer and laying the foundations for future growth. PS4.0bn Retail services sales 15% Online businesses sales growth 30% dunnhumby's sales and profits up over 30% 6.5m Tesco Bank customer accounts 2.5m Tesco Mobile customers Introduction In July 2008 when we announced our intention to take full ownership of Tesco Bank, we set a target to grow the profitability of our retail services businesses from just under PS400 million in 2007 8 to PS1 billion. This year, we have made creditable progress in moving towards this target. We have attracted new customers, grown sales and profit and continued to invest - particularly in infrastructure - to equip the business for further growth. We want all of our customers, across all of our markets, to have access to our financial, telecoms and online services. We can do this by applying Group skill and scale and building on the knowledge which we have acquired from our retail services experience in the UK, Ireland and South Korea. In 2010 11, total retail services sales were PS4.0 billion, up 12% on 2009 10 and trading profit grew to PS583 million. Tesco Bank Despite a challenging year in the wider banking sector, and as it completes its transition to full separation from The Royal Bank of Scotland RBS, Tesco Bank continues to perform well. The business has made good progress with its systems re-platforming, which will complete as planned in 2011. We opened our new banking and insurance service centres in Glasgow and Newcastle in October 2010. All new motor and home insurance business, including renewal policies sold since then have, as planned, been written on new systems. We also launched successfully our first new product on our own banking platforms - the Fixed Rate Saver - last autumn. This has been followed by our recent innovative retail bond. Both of these initiatives exceeded plan and serve to diversify our funding base and increase the proportion of long-term funding available to the Bank. The Bank has made progress in key areas - with savings strongly up, good growth in the loan book with improved margins and an excellent year in credit cards, with the transaction value up 20% on 2009 10. The car insurance book has also resumed growth, having plateaued before the change of control, despite the inevitable challenges of migration. Retail services profit comprises profit from Telecoms, tesco. com, dunnhumby and Tesco Bank, including UK store ATM income. 30 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Growing retail services TESCO TELECOMS We now have 194 Phone Shops in stores across the UK and this year, we have begun to open Phone Shops in our refreshed Extra stores in Central Europe. Our Phone Shops provide our customers with support and advice so that they can choose the best option for them. 194 Phone Shops in the UK TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 31 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Customer account numbers grew well - in active credit cards by 11%, personal loans by 17% and motor insurance by 8%. Our Fixed Rate Saver product significantly exceeded expectations and we ended the year with a balance of PS397 million, 40% higher than planned, and we now have one, two and three-year options available for customers. The range of products available for customers will be broadened further this year with the planned launch of mortgages. The Bank's bad debt position has significantly improved year-on-year, with the charge to the income statement 26% lower, despite the growth in lending, as credit card and loan defaults reduced, helped by good management of bad debt and the quality of our new business. This excellent progress on bad debt has also resulted in an increase in the release of the fair value provisions we made in the Group balance sheet on acquisition. Based on a lower than expected level of claims, we have also released some of our provisions for customer claims against payment protection insurance policies. These strong elements of the Bank's performance mean that we have been able to offset the substantial extra provisions made in the year related to bodily injury claims in our motor insurance business - a trend affecting the whole industry - and the costs of migration, yet still deliver increased trading profit. The baseline profitability of the Bank - before provisions movements and the adjustments required under acquisition accounting - continues to improve steadily, whilst absorbing the higher costs of migration away from RBS. We expect further improvements in the baseline profitability in 2011 12. Our Core Tier 1 capital ratio has risen substantially - to a healthy 15.9% at the year end. The strong growth in the Bank's deposit base means that we have a significant excess of deposits over loans, as we build out balance sheet capacity ahead of the planned launch of mortgages. com Our online businesses, including online grocery and Tesco Direct, had another strong year. Taking into account our operations in South Korea and Ireland, total sales grew by 15%. Our UK operations continued to grow well, with double-digit growth in grocery and a further 30% increase at Tesco Direct. We have worked consistently over the past year to innovate for customers in our online businesses so that we can provide them with a better online shopping trip. Our work on upgrading our tesco. com website has enabled us to launch an iPhone grocery app, which has been very popular - accounting for over 12% of customer traffic to the tesco. We know that our customers lead busy lives and love the convenience of our home grocery delivery service, so this year we have invested to make life even easier for customers. In the UK, we have successfully launched one hour delivery slots in London and we have been trialling a new Click and Collect service for groceries, which allows people to order online and collect their items from a store. So that we can support our growth momentum, we have increased our UK-wide delivery capacity by adding an extra 350 vans to our fleet and we are currently trialling a new scheduling system to increase the efficiency of our vans. Tesco Direct provides a platform to extend the reach of our general merchandise, clothing and electricals offer through the internet and catalogues. This year, Direct has achieved strong growth of 30%, including clothing online, which represents solid progress against a backdrop of continued pressure on household budgets through 2010 and early 2011. Throughout the year, we have made significant investments in our stores to improve the multi-channel shopping offer which is available through Direct. For example, customers can order online and pick up in-store or order in-store and have their delivery dropped off at their door. We have added 30 new Direct desks and 89 Collection Points and we now have 11 Order and Collect stores. In South Korea, we have launched a general merchandise website to complement the current grocery site. The new website launched in January. Our online business has performed well in Ireland with a 15% increase in sales and 12.5% increase in orders. In the next year, we are launching online shopping sites in the Czech Republic and Poland. 12% 12% of customer traffic to tesco. com site coming via our grocery app PS2m Our international calling card has generated sales of over PS2 million since its launch TESCO CREDIT CARD In February, one in eight of all MasterCard and Visa credit card transactions in the UK were made on a Tesco credit card. 32 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Growing retail services Tesco Telecoms Our Telecoms business grew well during the year, maintaining strong market share, driven primarily by the growth of Tesco Mobile. In 2010 Tesco Mobile was one of the fastest growing UK mobile networks, growing its customer base by 24% to over 2.5 million. Customers have responded positively to an increase in the number of mobile handsets we are offering, including the latest smartphones from Android to HTC models. In 2010, we entered the international calling card market. The market has recently been investigated by OFCOM and Tesco was one of the top performing service providers praised for its value, clarity and customer service. Our international calling card has generated sales of over PS2 million since launching and around 16,000 cards are sold in-store every week. Our Tesco Mobile joint ventures with O2 in Ireland and Slovakia are performing well. Both businesses are growing strongly and moved into profit for the first time this year. dunnhumby dunnhumby has had a very strong year, increasing sales and profits by over 30% with excellent growth in the UK supplier business and from its overseas joint ventures with retailers. Following the acquisition of the final 10% of the business in the first half of the year, dunnhumby is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesco. HOMEPLUS Homeplus is the number one grocery home shopping provider in South Korea, delivering just under 1.5 million orders last year. TESCO DIRECT In November 2010, Tesco Direct launched a new mobile website allowing customers to easily browse for and buy general merchandise items on their smartphone. DUNNHUMBY dunnhumby was founded in 1989 by Edwina Dunn and Clive Humby with the intention of embedding customer insight into the way organisations work. By analysing data from over 340 million people in 25 countries, dunnhumby helps companies to put their customers at the centre of every business decision. dunnhumby uses the insight generated by data they gather to allow companies to improve customers' experiences of shopping in their stores, branding and marketing. They work with companies to help them tailor their offer to the needs and wants of their customers. dunnhumby's work with some of the world's biggest retailers and brands has demonstrated that companies which deliver value to customers through personalisation earn customers' loyalty. This strategic approach of putting the customer first in business improves their clients' like-for-like sales and profit margins - or, put simply, creates measurable value. Employing more than 1,500 people in 30 offices in Europe, Asia and the Americas, dunnhumby serves a prestigious list of companies including Kellogg's, The Kroger Co. Muller, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Mars. dunnhumby's work has also extended beyond the grocery sector to include partnerships with Macy's, Shell and the Panera Bread Company. dunnhumby has worked with Tesco since the launch of Clubcard in the UK in 1995 and now works across the 12 markets where we have Clubcard. TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 33 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements T o be a creator of highly valued brands Tesco has been an industry leader in branding for many years using our broad appeal, wide product assortment and global supply chains to develop businesses that deliver reliable, innovative and great value brands for customers. The creation and spread of a number of strong brands has helped us to become a growth company, trusted by customers, valued by staff, respected by communities and profitable for shareholders. A brand is a promise, a set of fundamental principles that define a product or business. It is an intangible representation of what a company stands for in the minds of its customers and other stakeholders. Retail brands Product brands Pillar brands 38 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Building brands TESCO VALUE AND FINEST IN THE UK Customers appreciate the quality and breadth of our range and we are continuing to innovate in this area, particularly with our Pillar brands. The popularity of our Pillar brands with customers has meant that Tesco Value has become the second largest food brand in the UK - ahead of Coca-Cola - with sales of more than PS1 billion a year. Tesco Value is only pushed into second place by Tesco Finest. More than half of our customers buy from the Finest range on a regular basis, from Finest spectacles to Finest Restaurant Collection ready meals, making it an important component of our sales mix. PS1 bn Both Finest and Value now sell more than PS1bn each year TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 39 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Why are we building brands? Building brands enhances the value of our business by benefiting all of our stakeholders, including customers, staff, communities and shareholders. Being viewed positively by our stakeholders supports the creation of a successful, sustainable and profitable long-term business. What's the benefit to both our stakeholders and our Company of building brands? By building strong brands through our own products, we offer customers increased value, choice and quality. They are loyal to our brands because they know what to expect from them and what they stand for. With wine, for example, the Finest logo helps customers to pick out a good quality option without having to be a connoisseur. Strong Product and Pillar brands give us a key point of differentiation from our competitors and enable us to continue to meet the changing needs of our customers. Once customers understand the values that our brands stand for, they are more likely to trust in our ability to diversify into new service areas. In financial services, for example, with Tesco Bank we'five brought straightforward and good-quality banking solutions based on the needs of our customers to a market characterised by complexity and poor customer service. Wherever we operate we support local communities, their causes and the environment. Through initiatives such as our Community Champions programme, Get Healthy with Tesco Lotus in Thailand and the UK Tesco Great School Run, we're known to be a good neighbour. By benefiting local communities, our brand has taken on new meaning among stakeholders - that of a responsible retailer. By developing a brand reputation for offering great value and service to customers and being a responsible member of the community, we can attract great people to work for us. As a responsible and flexible employer with a track record of developing talent within the business, Tesco is also seen as a great place to build a career. The increased emotional and functional loyalty from customers, staff and communities generated by our brand building has contributed to Tesco becoming a profitable, sustainable growth opportunity for shareholders to invest in. Investment provides us with further opportunities to build and develop our brands across the Group, in turn allowing us to diversify to the benefit of customers, staff, communities and shareholders. Homeplus received South Korea's Most Admired Company award in October 2010 The increased emotional and functional loyalty from customers, staff and communities generated by our brand building has contributed to Tesco becoming a profitable, sustainable growth opportunity for shareholders. We launched our clothing brand F&F in the UK in 2001 with the aim of offering unbeatable value for money, not compromised by quality, design or provenance. F&F is now available in over 450 stores across the UK and is also available online. As awareness and popularity has grown in the UK, we'five also extended the brand - launching F&F in nine other markets across Europe and Asia. F&F is already the market-leading clothing brand in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. As the brand continues to develop, we opened our first stand-alone F&F store above - in Prague - this year. As customers have begun to gain confidence in the F&F brand, we have also broadened our range - with sub-brands such as F&F Basics, F&F Couture above and F&F Petite and extended the brand into homeware with a good, better, best hierarchy under F&F Home Basics, F&F Home and F&F Home Collection. F&F 40 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Building brands When entering a new market, building highquality stores in great locations is a priority. Our founder, Jack Cohen, developed the first store in the UK, which culminated in the 1980s with the Tesco superstore - still a core part of Tesco today. We'five since gone on to develop hypermarket format stores and smaller formats such as Metro and Express. It's important that our stores meet customers' expectations. A multi-format store offer, from Express to Extra, provides customers with different shopping trips to suit their varied needs. In Europe, we are introducing Extras, offering customers more products and services, from Phone Shops to Pharmacies. A crucial part of building an efficient network is the creation of centralised distribution centres to serve the store network quickly and efficiently. In Thailand this year, Tesco Lotus built its first Fresh Distribution Centre, handling over 230,000 cases of food every day. In China, we opened three distribution centres to serve our growing network. Once a network has been built in a market, we can begin to evolve a collection of stores into a Retail brand and to develop Product and Pillar brands. Through the introduction of Pillar brands, in food, for example, we provide customers with great choice, value and quality. We work hard to make sure that each of our brands is distinguishable and lives up to our customers' expectations. This builds the crucial element of trust in our brands. It also enables us to differentiate ourselves from other retailers, particularly in less developed markets. Clubcard provides us with unique insight into our customers' shopping habits so that we can continuously work to meet their needs. Clubcard gives our customers a sense of belonging and says 'thank you' by rewarding them for their loyalty. As a result, customers trust in and feel committed to the Tesco brand. Once Retail, Product and Pillar brands are present in a market, customers have an understanding of what our brands stand for - they trust in them. This means that our customers have confidence in our ability to deliver different products and services, allowing us to extend the Tesco brand into new areas. In many cases, the extension of our brand accompanies changes in our customers' lives. Changes such as the growth of the internet have led to the creation of new platforms for our brands with tesco. We're also innovating for our customers, offering new innovative products, such as our successful Tesco Bank Fixed Rate Saver. We're now beginning to extend the brand in a number of our international markets. In South Korea, we have a number of co-branded credit card offers to which 1.3 million customers have signed up, demonstrating the strength of the Homeplus brand. BUILDING THE NETWORK BUILDING THE BRAND EXTENDING THE BRAND EVOLUTION OF THE TESCO BRAND When entering new markets across the world we have broadly followed the same model, adapting where necessary to reflect the local culture and sentiment. Extending the brand Building the brand Building the network TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 41 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements T o build our team so that we create more value We are sharing operational excellence and leadership excellence across the Group so that we can successfully develop capability and nurture talent across our growing business. 492,714 Employees 75% We pay at least 75% of employee medical, dental, prescription and vision costs in the US 1,274 Employees at Tesco Bank PS1 05.5m Value of shares awarded under Shares In Success 70% Increase in the number of female Directors across the Group Introduction We treat people how we like to be treated. We want our people to enjoy working at Tesco. Our people do a great job each and every day by giving our customers the best possible shopping trip. By creating an open environment of trust and respect, our people feel supported, they share their knowledge and experience and work hard to give our customers great service. We support our people, trusting in their ability to deliver while helping them to reach their full potential. We encourage our people to learn on the job and take responsibility from day one. Giving our people an opportunity to get on in their careers is very important. With the increasing breadth of the Tesco business, our people have a great opportunity to develop their skills and experience across new product areas, services and countries. Every year, we build our plans for the year around our People Promises. We want all of our people across all of our markets to: be treated with respect: have an opportunity to get on: have a manager who helps them: and have an interesting job. It's through our People Promises and our benefits package that we are proud to say that our people stay with us for a long time. Around half of our Director population has at least 12 years' service. In recognition of the importance of people across our business, our Group Personnel Director, Alison Horner, is now part of our Executive Committee. Alison is a great example of talent developed in Tesco, with 12 years of experience across the business in both Personnel and Operations. 42 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Building our team CAREER DEVELOPMENT We believe that home-grown managers make valuable business leaders because they understand our culture and approach. Our new CEO, Philip Clarke, is an example of this, having started work at Tesco part-time as a schoolboy. Across the business, we currently have almost 30,000 people on development programmes, gaining the knowledge, leadership skills and qualifications for their next role. 30,000 People training for their next role TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 43 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements We know that to be a successful international retailer we need to combine deep local knowledge with global experience. We are committed to developing local leaders in each country we're in. In South Korea, our largest international business, we have over 23,000 employees and just nine people from our UK business. We are also keen to provide opportunities for our people to gain experience in our global markets. As the business grows, Tesco benefits from moving our people around, sharing their skills and expertise across the Group. We want the women in our teams to achieve their full potential. Back in 1997 in the UK, we had only 31 female Store Managers, we now have almost 150. In the last four years in the UK the number of female directors has increased by nearly 70% across the Group and we have three women on our Board. Our Women's Network provides skills development, mentoring and networking opportunities for our female managers and directors, and this year we're launching our new Women in Leadership programme. Over 50 women from our UK and European businesses have been nominated based on their potential to undertake bigger and broader roles. The programme consists of seminars and courses focusing on confidence, strategic career planning and building personal authority. Three women in Tesco are currently being coached as part of the FTSE 100 Cross-Company Mentoring Programme. The Programme, launched in 2003, involves FTSE 100 Chairmen and CEOs acting as mentors to senior women just below board level in other FTSE companies. The mentors guide and advise women in the management of their careers so that they are better positioned to be considered for board appointments. Our Chairman David Reid, will begin working with his third mentee from outside Tesco in June 2011. Building capability As part of our ongoing commitment to building capability, we are investing in the Tesco Academy. Our Academy supports the development of our people through training courses, networking opportunities and mentoring. Our Academy is especially important to our managers and directors, supporting them in the delivery of their day-to-day roles and the development of their leadership capabilities. In July, we will open our zero-carbon Academy centre in Incheon, South Korea. Asia is a rapidly growing region for Tesco and the Academy will help us to build capability in the area. Each and every job in Tesco has a clearly assigned training programme to accompany it. We work hard to ensure that every member of our team receives the operational training which they need for their job and the leadership skills which can support their career development. In China, our Store Manager Programme has been created so that we can recruit and develop people to become our future Store Managers. This is especially important as we expand in this quickly developing country. The programme started in October 2010 with 22 candidates taking part. Thailand is currently in the process of recruiting candidates so that they can launch their own Store Manager Programme. Recruitment and growth As Tesco grows and diversifies, we are able to offer more jobs and broader roles to people in the communities around our stores, depots and offices. This year we have recruited 21,000 people worldwide. Over the past year, the Tesco Bank workforce has more than tripled in size. As Tesco Bank develops, we have an increasing need for people to join the team so that we can support the expanding Tesco Bank customer base. The vast majority of the new Tesco Bank staff are customer service representatives and team leaders, following the opening of new call centres in Newcastle and Glasgow this year. Our graduate programmes fast track graduate trainees with high potential into leadership positions. This year we have recruited around 140 Commercial graduates into UK and Central European buying and general merchandise roles - the largest number of Commercial graduates that we have employed since the programme began. This is part of our ongoing commitment to invest in future leaders. Talent and promotions One of our People Promises is that we will provide 'an opportunity to get on'. We promise to support and develop our people so that they are able to advance in their careers. All of our people have discussions about their careers and performance and all of our leadership teams talk about succession plans and talent at least once a year. FRESH & EASY Our US business, Fresh & Easy, created over 800 jobs this year and the opening of our first 11 stores in Northern California created a further 300 local jobs in March and April. All Fresh & Easy employees have the opportunity to work at least 20 hours per week, which entitles them to comprehensive and affordable healthcare, with Fresh & Easy picking up the majority of the costs. 44 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Building our team In Malaysia, we have launched our Finance Graduate Programme. Building on the knowledge gained from our UK Finance Graduate scheme, the Malaysian programme was launched to support our ambition of becoming an employer of choice for Finance in the country. By supporting and developing local graduates, we can also support the development of our Finance capability in Asia. Rewards and benefits Our people do a great job for our customers and we want them to feel valued and rewarded. We believe that staff rewards should be competitive, simple and sustainable to build trust and loyalty amongst our employees and assist with hiring and retention. We invest in pay and, in the UK, we have the highest basic pay rates for customer assistants of any major supermarket. All of our staff move to higher rates of pay within a year of joining our business. Across all of our markets, we offer a wide range of competitive benefits. In the US, for example, we pay at least 75% of medical, dental, prescription and vision costs. Our staff Clubcard launched in Thailand and Malaysia this year with a positive reception from our staff, and we are planning to introduce the staff Clubcard into two further countries later this year. The card offers a discount to staff when they shop in our stores. In the UK we have a defined benefit pension scheme which is greatly valued by our staff and rare among FTSE 100 companies. Our UK pension provides people with an annual income at retirement as well as benefits on ill health and death based on their pay and service. Last year we invested over PS270 million in our UK staff pensions. Share ownership incentive schemes help our staff to get their own personal stake in Tesco. 216,000 staff shared a total of PS105.5 million when the Shares In Success scheme matured in 2010. TESCO ACADEMY Our zero-carbon Tesco Academy centre in Incheon, South Korea, will open in July. T o read the Annual Report online: http: ar2011. com DEGREE PROGRAMMES In a number of our markets, we provide our people with the opportunity to study for a degree while they work. In the UK and Ireland, we provide the opportunity for employees to complete a Retail Foundation Degree. This is a two-year retail degree undertaken by staff members in association with Manchester Metropolitan University. The first pilot group of 17 employees began their courses in 2007 and graduated in 2009. These students spend several days at university at the beginning of each term and the rest of their studying is either conducted online, by telephone or via email. This way, they earn while they learn, with Tesco paying all their fees. Given that university fees are now much higher in the UK, we expect the popularity of this scheme to increase dramatically. Over the past two years, 56 students have graduated and over 60% of this population have progressed to a higher managerial role. Building on from the success in the UK and Ireland, in 2008 in Turkey we launched a Retail Programme in collaboration with Izmir Economic University. Whilst they are studying, students complete vocational training with Tesco Kipa, which ensures them a guaranteed job with us after their graduation. In Turkey, unemployment for young people is especially high so the guarantee of a job at the end of the programme makes a real difference. of those who have completed a Retail Foundation Degree have progressed to a higher managerial role OUR FIRST NATIONAL VALUES AWARDS CEREMONY We want our people to feel valued for the work which they do. In our business, we have Values awards which are given to colleagues to say thank you when they have gone the extra mile in their work. Last year, we had our first ever Values Awards Ceremony in the UK. The ceremony recognised the exceptional contributions made by colleagues from all levels across the business. 60 finalists attended the event from over 6,000 nominations. The nominees were put forward by colleagues in a variety of categories from 'Snow Hero' to 'Being first for customers'. The event was a great success and will be repeated this year. TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 45 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Finding the right location Our Site Research departments in each country direct the property acquisition strategy by identifying optimal locations for new store developments and extensions. This work is underpinned by advanced spatial analysis and a data-led approach that considers our customers, competitors, local market shares and existing store performance. The Site Research teams provide sales forecasts for new stores using highly accurate, in-house models built using our existing store performance, Clubcard data, demographic data, government statistics and road networks. On average we forecast the sales of new UK stores to within 3% accuracy. Property - developing and building stores for customers Tesco's property activities have one principal objective: to ensure our customers can benefit from the best located and designed stores. As a result of this property development and management, we also create sustainable, long-term, embedded value for shareholders. Acquiring high-quality property is an important component of being a successful retailer. Through our experience over decades in the UK - and more recently in international markets - we have market-leading property skills that help us stay ahead of our competitors. We have built up a substantial set of assets, which in total have a market value of PS36 billion. By owning our property we get the benefits of appreciation in property prices - in particular in the emerging markets in which we operate. The process for creating value in property starts with finding the right location. After acquiring a site and gaining planning consent we design and build a world-class store. We then trade from that store and increase its value as we grow our sales. And then once an asset is mature we look to crystallise the value created by selling it and leasing it back at a reasonable rent. This frees up capital which can be invested in new developments. Flexible, multi-format approach Having multiple formats - from large shopping malls to Express convenience stores - allows us to fulfil the full range of shopping missions for customers and it also gives us flexibility to adapt to different local markets and planning regimes. In some cases we also develop mixed-use projects, combining new retail space with residential development on the same site. This enables us to build a store on a desirable site when otherwise it would not be economically viable. 46 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Property Design blueprints Our formats are supported by design blueprints to ensure best practice is replicated across the Tesco Group. We have used our successful UK formats and experience internationally to build plans for each of our formats, as well as for our mall developments. The blueprints codify guidelines for the sales area, design standards, operating procedures, people plans and financial insight. They also allow us to build for less as we standardise building specifications and fixtures and fittings for Group scale buying. SHOPPING MALLS Tesco is one of the world's largest operators of shopping malls, with approximately 30m sq ft of mall space across Europe and Asia. In these markets we have found that the most successful hypermarkets are located in busy shopping malls and by owning and operating our own malls we are able to ensure we have highquality sites from which our hypermarkets can trade. Our mall business is a combination of owning and operating existing malls - as a landlord - and building new malls as a developer. The mall business provides a stable, profitable income stream - one that has grown throughout the recession. Our significant experience in operating malls and our many long-term tenant relationships with retailers help us to design and fill our new malls. Our fastest expansion in new malls is currently in China where we are rolling out our new Lifespace mall concept. The blueprint is approximately 400,000 sq ft of retail and family leisure space anchored by a Tesco hypermarket. We have four malls currently trading and expect to have up to ten by the end of this year. We're also starting to redevelop some of our older malls around the world to access their full potential. In a number of markets we are starting to convert small strips of shops alongside well-located Tesco hypermarkets into large modern shopping malls, creating compelling retail destinations. Property Finance Strategy Tesco releases some of the value that it has created through carefully selected divestments of some of its property, as well as taking advantage of strong market conditions offering good yields. Over the last five years we have delivered in excess of PS5 billion of proceeds in line with our stated objectives in 2006 at an average net initial yield of 4.9%. We have also generated profits from property-related items of PS1.3 billion over the past five years. We have used the proceeds to invest in property assets in growth economies, buy back c. PS1.1 billion of our own shares and enhance dividends for shareholders. In the future we intend to deliver PS250 - PS350 million per year in property profits, which is a sustainable profit stream as it is broadly equivalent to the value we create through development activities. This will require us to divest just over PS1 billion of property per year. This level of divestment is sustainable as we invest around PS2.5 billion per year in growth capital - so the asset base will continue to grow. It is currently more attractive to divest UK property as yields and projected GDP growth in the UK are lower than in our overseas markets. Over time however, we expect a growing proportion of the divestments to come from our other countries as properties mature. Some of these future international divestments will be shopping malls that have been fully developed. In such cases, we will release capital for new investments by selling the mall to investors and leasing back the Tesco hypermarket. Importantly, when we do this, it will always be our objective to manage the malls after divestment to ensure they remain excellent locations from which our hypermarkets can succeed.

The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group has an appropriate approach to risk management and internal control within the context of achieving the Group's objectives. Our process for identifying and managing risks is set out in more detail from page 71 of the Directors' report on corporate governance. The table below sets out the principal risks faced by the Group and examples of relevant key controls and mitigating factors. The Board considers these to be the most significant risks. They do not comprise all risks associated with the Group and are not set out in any order of priority. Additional risks not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse effect on the business. Risk is an accepted part of doing business. The real challenge for any business is to identify the principal risks it faces and to develop and monitor appropriate controls.

In addition to the principal risks above that apply generally to the Group as a whole, the section below sets out principal risks relating specifically to the Bank. Funding and liquidity Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank, although solvent, either does not have available sufficient financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure such resources only at excessive cost Funding risk is the risk that the Bank does not have sufficiently stable and diverse sources of funding or the funding structure is inefficient Dedicated Treasury function responsible for management of funding and liquidity risks within the framework approved by Tesco Bank Board Conservative Balance Sheet structure with prudent risk appetite supported by explicit targets and metrics which enable funding and liquidity to be managed in excess of regulatory requirements Strong liquid position with a diversified stock of highly marketable liquid assets that can be used as a buffer against unforeseen impacts on cash flow or in stressed environments Lending activities are primarily funded by retail deposits Daily monitoring and management of key funding and liquidity ratios with monthly reporting to Assets & Liabilities Management Committee and Tesco Bank Board Regular stress testing undertaken to assess the adequacy of funding and liquidity resources during periods of market dislocation and stress External environment The Bank is exposed to general UK economic conditions as well as general market trends in the areas in which it operates. Economic conditions are subject to significant uncertainty with commentators split on the sustainability of the economic recovery. General economic and market conditions are likely to have an impact on the Bank's credit portfolios Independent Credit Risk team, reporting directly to Chief Risk Officer, responsible for the development and oversight of the credit risk framework and supporting the business in the implementation of policies and processes Low credit risk appetite with focus on responsible lending and maintaining a risk profile better than the industry average Whilst credit performance has remained strong and favourable to industry averages, the Bank continues to closely monitor its credit portfolios and make changes to its business acquisition and credit limit management strategies to mitigate, as far as possible, downside economic risks The impact of extreme but plausible deterioration in economic conditions is considered as part of the Bank's stress-testing programme Regular reporting of credit risk information and performance against risk appetite to Tesco Bank's Risk Management Committee, Board Risk Committee and Board 54 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Principal risks and uncertainties Principal risks Key controls and mitigating factors TESCO BANK FINANCIAL SERVICES RISKS CONTINUED Insurance risk The Bank is exposed to insurance risks directly through its historic distribution agreement with Royal Bank of Scotland Insurance RBSI and indirectly through its ownership of 49.9% of Tesco Underwriting Limited TU, an authorised insurance company The key insurance risks within TU relate to underwriting risk and specifically the potential for a major weather event to generate significant Home insurance claims or, in relation to Motor insurance, the cost of settling bodily injury claims The legacy arrangement with RBSI is now in run-off and the primary risk that the Bank remains exposed to is reserving risk - the risk that reserves set aside by RBSI will be insufficient to cover the ultimate cost of insurance claims arising. This is particularly relevant to Motor insurance claims where the ultimate cost of large bodily injury claims is uncertain and the time taken to settle such claims can vary significantly depending on the severity of the injury Since October 2010 Pet, Travel and Breakdown insurance have all been distributed by the Bank on a 'white label' basis. The Bank does not carry the insurance risks associated with these products Independent Tesco Bank Insurance Risk team, reporting directly to Chief Risk Officer, that operates as the primary contact across all risk disciplines for the insurance business Underwriting risks actively managed within TU with close monitoring of performance metrics. Independent oversight conducted by the Bank Performance against insurance risk appetite is monitored closely at a senior level and reported to Tesco Bank's Risk Management Committee, Board Risk Committee and Board Reinsurance programme to limit the Bank's exposure above predetermined levels The impact of specific Motor and Home insurance events is considered as part of the Bank's stress-testing programme and ICAAP Regulatory environment Regulatory risk is the risk of failure to meet the Bank's obligations under the Financial Services and Markets Act FSMA, the Consumer Credit Act and the Data Protection Act and to meet the expectations of regulators. The Bank is subject to significant regulatory oversight, including supervision by the FSA which has substantial powers of intervention There is currently a significant amount of regulatory change including the continued evolution of capital and liquidity requirements. The regulatory landscape is changing with current FSA responsibilities due to migrate to the new Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. Detailed proposals for the new regulatory authorities are due to be published later this year There remains continued regulatory focus in relation to 'Conduct Risk' or 'Treating Customers Fairly' TCF. Specifically there has been continued focus on complaints relating to the sale of Payment Protection Insurance PPI Independent Regulatory Risk team, reporting directly to Chief Risk Officer, providing oversight and support to the business to ensure that regulatory risks are identified and managed appropriately The Bank has minimal appetite for regulatory risks and it maintains a control framework, including a suite of risk policies, to comply with regulatory requirements Regular reporting of regulatory risks to Tesco Bank's Risk Management Committee, Board Risk Committee and Board as well as to the FSA Significant senior management time and focus allocated to management of regulatory risks and the ongoing regulatory relationship The Bank has established a 'TCF Board' which is responsible for monitoring and challenging the customer-related aspects of the Tesco Bank business and, where appropriate, recommending further action PPI complaints handling brought in-house to improve the customer experience and to ensure that the outcomes are aligned with the policy introduced by the Bank The Bank has recognised a provision for potential customer redress, including compensation that may be required in relation to PPI complaints TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 55 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Principal risks Key controls and mitigating factors TESCO BANK FINANCIAL SERVICES RISKS CONTINUED Operations Operational risk is the risk of loss caused by human error, ineffective or inadequately designed processes, system failure or improper conduct including criminal activity A significant amount of services and processes are provided by third-party service providers and currently a key operational risk to the business is a failure by an outsourced provider The Bank has low appetite for operational risk, although it accepts higher risk in the short term as a result of the transformation programme, with the operational risk framework overseen by a dedicated unit within independent Risk function Risk registers maintained across the Bank which capture and quantify the risks arising in each of the commercial, insurance, operations and central functions areas Third-party services are managed through a series of Commercial Services Agreements CSAs with effective oversight arrangements established to ensure CSAs are delivered in compliance with contractual terms Regular reporting of operational risk information and performance, including financial crime, against risk appetite to Tesco Bank's Risk Management Committee, Board Risk Committee and Board Transformation programme The Bank has embarked on a significant transformation programme to develop and embed its own infrastructure to allow it to migrate systems and support from the Royal Bank of Scotland Group infrastructure In addition, the Bank has well-developed plans for launching mortgages, subject to FSA approval. Vertex, a leading global Customer Management Outsourcing business, will support entry into the mortgage market by providing IT application platforms and customer sales and service for the Bank's mortgage business. Current accounts are another key element in widening the Bank's product range with the customer proposition and detailed programme plans currently being developed. The addition of new products adds further to the complexity and delivery challenge of the transformation programme The Transformation Delivery Group TDG is the key governance forum for the delivery of the programme objectives. The forum is chaired by the Bank's Chief Operating Officer with representation across all areas of the Bank including Commercial, Operations, IT, Risk and Finance Strong programme governance in place with TDG supported by Programme Implementation Boards and Project Control Committees Project management disciplines in place, including detailed programme plans and risk and issue management to enable effective management of the programme scope, delivery timelines and adherence to budget Ongoing programme of audit reviews, risk profiles and 'health checks' with monthly reporting to Tesco Bank's Risk Management Committee, Audit Committee and Board 56 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Principal risks and uncertainties Some of the larger UK banks have significant funding targets for 2011 and, coupled with the expiry of the Special Liquidity Scheme, will increase the possibility of aggressive competition in both the retail and wholesale funding markets. This increase in demand could increase the cost of both retail and wholesale funding although improving market sentiment in the wholesale funding markets may generate additional supply. It is intended that the majority of the Bank's funding will continue to be raised in the retail deposit market with a product range and competitive deposit rates designed to attract a wider customer base. The Bank also accesses the wholesale funding markets, having successfully completed a PS125 million Wholesale Bond from the Bank's Euro Medium Term Note programme which provides an additional source of funding from retail investors. Interest rate risk management Our objective is to limit our profit and loss downside from rising interest rates. Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and floors are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Our policy is to fix interest rates for the year on a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs of the Group excluding Tesco Bank. At the year end, PS6.2 billion of debt 2010 - PS5.6 billion was at fixed rates of interest. This equates to 91% of total debt 2010 - 72%. The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate form. The average rate of interest paid on an historic cost basis this year, excluding joint ventures and associates, was 5.4% 2010 - 5.4%. Interest rate risk arises where assets and liabilities in Tesco Bank's banking activities have different repricing dates. Tesco Bank policy seeks to minimise the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates. Potential exposures to interest rate movements in the medium to long term are measured and controlled through position and sensitivity limits. Short-term exposures are measured and controlled in terms of net interest income sensitivity over 12 months to a 1% parallel movement in interest rates. Tesco Bank also uses Value at Risk VaR for risk management purposes with a time horizon of one trading day and a confidence interval of 95%. Interest rate risk is managed using interest rate swaps as the main hedging instrument. Foreign currency risk management Our principal objective is to reduce the effect of exchange rate volatility on operating margins. Transactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are managed, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies and currency options. At the year end, forward foreign currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to PS1.615 billion were outstanding 2010 - PS1.083 billion as detailed in note 22. We do not actively hedge our investment in our international subsidiaries other than by ensuring that each subsidiary is appropriately leveraged. During the year, currency movements decreased the net value of the Group's overseas assets by PS241 million last year increase of PS477 million. We translate overseas profits at average foreign exchange rates which we do not currently further manage. Financial review The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and credit risks relating to the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions. The management of these risks is set out below. The Group Balance Sheet position at 26 February 2011 is representative of the position throughout the year. Funding and liquidity The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, disposals of property assets, long and medium-term debt capital market issues, short-term commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases. The objective is to ensure continuity of funding. The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities and a strong credit rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. Tesco Group has a long-term rating of A3 with a negative outlook by Moody's, Astable with Fitch and Astable by Standard & Poor's. New funding of PS1.7 billion was arranged during the year, including a net PS1.6 billion from property disposals and PS0.1 billion from long-term debt. At the year end, net debt was PS6.8 billion 2010 - PS7.9 billion. Liquidity and funding has been a key area of focus in the banking industry and for financial services regulators. The FSA's new liquidity framework became effective on 1 June 2010 with Tesco Bank subject to additional liquidity requirements in the form of Individual Liquidity Guidance ILG. Tesco Bank maintains a robust and prudent liquidity risk management approach with an effective governance structure for measuring, managing and monitoring liquidity, as defined in its Liquidity Risk Management Policy, which provides the framework which enables funding and liquidity to be maintained in excess of regulatory requirements. The Bank has built up a strong liquidity position with a diversified stock of highly marketable liquid assets that can be used as a buffer against unforeseen impacts on cash flow or in stressed environments. Stress testing is regularly undertaken to simulate how events may impact its funding and liquidity capabilities and is updated where required as market conditions evolve. The Bank's first Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment ILAA was submitted to the FSA during the year with external assurance provided in relation to this report. TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 57 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Credit risk The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions across an approved list of counterparties of good credit quality. The Group's positions with these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored. Tesco Bank retail credit risk is managed through the credit risk policy framework, which is agreed through the Tesco Bank Risk Management Committee and defines limits and standards at all stages of the customer lifecycle, including new account sanctioning, customer management and collections and recoveries activity. Customer credit decisions are managed principally through the deployment of bespoke credit scorecard models and credit policy rules which restrict specific areas of lending, and an affordability assessment which determines a customer's ability to repay an outstanding credit amount. Wholesale counterparty credit risk limits are managed in accordance with a control framework, approved by the Tesco Bank Risk Management Committee, which sets limits based on counterparty creditworthiness and instrument type. Tesco Bank continues to use Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's ratings as part of the credit assessment process. Insurance We purchased assets, earnings and combined liability protection from the open insurance market for higher value losses only. The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the business by using our captive insurance companies, ELH Insurance Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the Republic of Ireland. ELH Insurance Limited covers Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability, while Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability only.

        "Detailed Analysis of ROE": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is ROE increasing or declining?**  \n  The **Return on Equity (ROE)** has slightly declined from **0.1606** in the previous year to **0.1579** in the current year, indicating a marginal decrease in the company's profitability relative to shareholders' equity.\n\n- **Is growth in ROE higher than that of competitors and the industry?**  \n  The textual report does not provide explicit competitor or industry ROE benchmarks, but it notes modest profit growth and challenges in key markets like the UK, while international operations showed stronger performance. Given the slight decline in ROE and the mixed business environment, it is unlikely that the company's ROE growth outpaces competitors or the overall industry.\n\n- **Is growth persistent or temporary?**  \n  The decline in ROE appears to be linked to strategic investments, especially in the UK business where profits were sacrificed in the short term for long-term growth. The report also mentions an expected short-term drop in ROCE due to these investments, implying the ROE dip may be temporary and tied to restructuring and growth initiatives.\n\n# Forecasts:\n- **Expected ROE next year:** Given the company's focus on improving UK operations, growing international businesses, and returning Fresh & Easy to profitability, **ROE is expected to stabilize or improve modestly** in the next fiscal year as these initiatives take effect.\n\n# Summary:\n- The company\u2019s **ROE declined slightly from 16.06% to 15.79%**, reflecting modest profit growth alongside significant reinvestment.\n- The **short-term dip in ROE is likely due to strategic reinvestment in the UK and slower profitability in some international markets**, particularly the US and China.\n- The strong international growth and restructuring efforts suggest **potential for ROE recovery**, supported by the company\u2019s target to improve ROCE to 14.6% by 2014-15.\n- Risks include ongoing economic headwinds in key markets and the timing of profitability improvements in the US and Tesco Bank.\n- Overall, the company demonstrates resilience but faces challenges balancing short-term returns and long-term growth.",
        "Detailed Analysis of ROE Drivers": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?**  \n  The data indicates a **slight decline in Assets Turnover** from **5.13 to 5.02**, showing a minor drop in efficiency. The **Profit Margin remains nearly flat**, showing a very marginal decrease from **0.04357 to 0.04348**. Thus, the growth in ROE is not driven by increases in both efficiency and margin but rather both measures are slightly declining or stagnant, indicating limited ROE growth drivers currently.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  The **Assets Turnover ratio above 5** is exceptionally high, suggesting the company is very efficient in utilizing assets to generate sales, which is generally above average in most retail and service industries. The **Profit Margin of approximately 4.35%** is modest but consistent with retail sector norms. The textual report highlights Tesco's robust international presence and operational effectiveness, supporting that these ratios likely compare favorably or at least competitively within the sector.\n\n# Forecasts:\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year**: Given the slight decline and the company's focus on capital discipline and efficiency improvements, **Asset Turnover is expected to stabilize or slightly improve to around 5.05** as operational effectiveness initiatives take hold.\n- **Expected Profit Margin next year**: With the UK investment plan and international growth focus, **Profit Margin may hold steady or see a marginal increase toward 4.4%**, reflecting moderate margin improvement from cost control and refreshed customer offerings.\n\n# Summary:\n- The company's **ROE drivers show a stronger reliance on operational efficiency (Assets Turnover)**, although it has slightly declined this year.  \n- **Profit Margin is stable but remains a weaker driver of ROE growth**, with only minimal change year-on-year.  \n- Tesco's strategic focus on improving the UK shopping trip and international expansion should **support stabilization or modest improvement in both efficiency and margin**, though short-term margin pressure is possible due to reinvestment.  \n- The very high **Assets Turnover ratio reflects Tesco\u2019s strong asset utilization**, a competitive advantage in retail.  \n- Overall, the company's **operational effectiveness and international diversification underpin its financial resilience**, but ROE growth is currently modest.",

This is a business with an unusual range and depth of core competencies: it has outstanding operational effectiveness: it understands deeply what it means to orientate a business around the customer: it is passionate, and successful, about developing talent from within: and it manages a complex operating environment with great team work. \" Nearly six months after taking over from Sir David Reid, it is good to have this opportunity to share my perspective on recent developments which I will do under three headings: context: transition: and governance. Context There are many things that strike a newcomer to Tesco. This is a business with an unusual range and depth of core competencies: it has outstanding operational effectiveness: it understands deeply what it means to orientate a business around the customer: it is passionate, and successful, about developing talent from within: and it manages a complex operating environment with great team work. It is also a business that is not afraid to learn and change, capacities perhaps more than any others which are essential to long-term growth. In this respect there are three areas in particular worth identifying. First, Tesco is a business with significant strategic optionality. It has expertise and capital, human and financial, that can be leveraged in different geographies, in different sectors of retailing and through new and different channels, notably of course the internet. The development of these opportunities can make Tesco a stronger company and benefit the UK as a whole. And with such opportunity also comes responsibility - to ensure that the trade-offs between different investments are reached in a disciplined way: and that the optimum balance is struck overall between current returns and future growth. Second, as the business grows internationally, it is important not only that we explain ourselves to the world but also that we listen and see ourselves as others do. Since arriving at Tesco last year I have visited many different parts of the business around the world, met many of our staff, talked to shareholders, suppliers, commentators, community leaders and to customers. This is the broader context of our business to which we need continuously to relate, openly, honestly and constructively for the long-term benefit of our business. Third, I have been impressed by the skills, commitment and values held by the people who work at Tesco and all of whom not only contribute to its success but make the company what it is. They are a great team and all those with a stake in Tesco have reason to admire and be grateful for their efforts. I would like to thank them, on behalf of the whole Board, for all that they do. Transition This has been a year of transition. Philip Clarke took over as Chief Executive at the beginning of the year and he has been shaping both the organisation of the business and the management team which inevitably, after a long period of stability, are entering a period of change and development. This work takes time but is essential to our future as a strong and profitable company. All successful companies go through periods of transition. Indeed, the capacity to change and develop over time is fundamental to truly world-class companies. The critical issue for those responsible is to fully acknowledge the need for and to manage change in a measured and timely fashion when it is called for. Sir Richard Broadbent Chairman Scan here to hear more from Sir Richard Broadbent, or visit www. com ar2012 chairman Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 1 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Chairman's statement We have moved to address performance issues in the UK. The challenge of refocusing the UK business to ensure it sustains healthy market leadership is important enough to make it worth giving up some profit in the short term to safeguard the business in the long term. We laid out in April how we intend to do this. Elsewhere, we have continued the substantial re-orientation of the US business to give it the best possible opportunity to secure its future with all the potential for longer-term growth that would bring. We have announced our intention to exit from Japan. We are willing to invest for the long term but where we cannot see a profitable, scalable business earning good returns within an acceptable timescale, we prefer to pursue better opportunities. And we have slowed down the development of Tesco Bank to increase its focus on quality, service and risk management. These are substantial changes, in management, organisation and business and they need to be seen as part of a continuing process of moving the company forward, making changes where necessary to ensure long-term stability and sustainable profitability. Governance Governance is the framework that articulates a company's values and supports its behaviours. During the year, we updated our governance framework and processes as described in more detail on page 50. An important aspect of these changes was the creation of the Board Corporate Responsibility Committee to ensure that the Board maintains a strategic focus on corporate responsibility in its widest sense, reflecting the importance to the Group of how it engages externally. When a company has significant economic and social scale it is essential that it reflects on the full nature of its accountability for its activities, and how it should discharge that responsibility to the communities in which it operates. This will be an important focus for the new Committee. There have been a number of changes to the Board. In addition to Sir David Reid, David Potts retired during the year, Richard Brasher stepped down from the Board in March, and Andrew Higginson will retire in September. We thank them all for their contribution to the business over the years. We are also pleased to welcome Deanna Oppenheimer to the Board as a Non-executive Director. Deanna brings valuable international, retail, banking and digital experience to our Board. Financial results In the year, we delivered sales growth of 7.4%. Profit growth was modest, with a strong international performance largely offset by a reduction in UK profits. Trading profit grew by 1.3%, and profit before tax grew by 5.3%. Return on capital employed improved from 12.9% last year to 13.3%, and we continued our long record of dividend growth for shareholders, with the full year dividend up 2.1% to 14.76p. The fact that in a year when economic headwinds have been evident in practically every part of the globe our business increased sales, profits, return on capital and dividends speaks for its overall resilience. Looking ahead Last year was a challenging one for the business and we are acutely aware that this was reflected for our shareholders in the share price. We will continue in 2012 13 to address long-standing business issues in the UK and elsewhere in order to secure future prosperity as well as ensuring that our financial and human resources are developed and deployed where they are able most effectively to generate future growth and returns. If I have one overriding impression of Tesco after six months, it is that here is a truly international business, deploying its expertise across the world to drive opportunity, growth and returns, all of which ultimately benefit the UK. I look forward to being part of it. Sir Richard Broadbent Chairman Chairman's statement 2 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 \"My first year as Chief Executive has been a year where we have implemented important changes at Tesco, a year when we have built strength for the future. \" It has been a year of significant change and one in which we took decisive action on some very important issues for Tesco: our reset of expectations for the UK for the forthcoming year, the announcement of our intention to dispose of our business in Japan, the focus on moving Fresh & Easy closer to profitability and the renewed focus on delivering a reliable Tesco Bank. As a part of this we made several key management changes during the year which have allowed some significant new appointments as we renew and reinvigorate the Tesco team. This has very much laid the ground for the future: a future where we will make sure that our capital and our talent are put to work where it benefits most our customers and hence our shareholders. The future Tesco will demonstrate greater innovation and creativity as we address the needs of consumers around our world - both in store and online. We regularly deliver over 75 million shopping trips a week and as a retailer are only as good as the last trips. Ensuring that Tesco is highly valued by customers on each and every one of those shopping trips will be what makes Tesco achieve sustainable success. That is what we set out to do every day. I believe that we have faced into challenges with real determination and taken decisions for the future. I know that it has been a tough year to be a Tesco shareholder. I know too that my whole team and I are confident that the changes we are making are the right things to do - for customers, staff, the business and its shareholders - and that the long-term opportunities for Tesco remain undiminished.

Whilst the year gave us many things to be proud of, overall it was not the most pleasing performance. My team and I are resolved to get Tesco back to winning, particularly at home. Group sales increased by 7.4% to PS72 billion, while Group trading profit was up 1.3% on last year and underlying profit before tax rose to PS3.9 billion, an increase of 1.6%. Group capital expenditure in the year was PS3.8 billion. Group return on capital employed 'ROCE' increased - to 13.3% last year 12.9%. The Board has proposed a final dividend of 10.13p per share, taking the full year dividend to 14.76p, which is an increase of 2.1% on last year. The decisions we have taken during the year have had an impact on our financial performance. We decided to forego some short-term profit to re-invest in the long-term health of the business, with a clear focus on improving the shopping trip for customers. The UK business clearly did not meet our own expectations in the year and, partly as a result of this, we decided to accelerate our plan to make improvements which has meant a necessary reset to expectations for our growth in 2012 13 as well. This acceleration and reset were announced with our Christmas trading update in January. Despite this significant re-investment programme, we remain committed to driving higher returns for shareholders. Although our investment plans in the UK make achieving our ROCE target more challenging in the short term, we still expect to deliver a ROCE of 14.6% by 2014 15, with broadly based growth from around the Group. Strategic update In last year's Annual Report, I set out an evolution of our strategy into seven parts: To grow the UK core: To be an outstanding international retailer in stores and online: To be as strong in everything we sell as we are in food: To grow retail services in all our markets: To put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do: To be a creator of highly valued brands: and To build our team so that we create more value. This strategy remains as relevant now as it did a year ago and I'm pleased to be able to update you on the progress we have made on each of these strategic objectives. I also set out immediate management priorities for the business last year - keeping the UK strong and growing: becoming outstanding internationally, not just successful: becoming a multi-channel retailer wherever we trade: delivering on the potential of retail services: applying Group skill and scale: and delivering higher returns. You will see how these priorities have shaped our actions through the year. To grow the UK core The deli counter in our Hertford Superstore has a flat glass front, bright lighting and warmer, more engaging signage In the UK, high petrol prices and falling real incomes affected customers' discretionary spending in the year. The combination of disappointing sales in the second half of the year and our decision to increase investment into the shopping trip meant that our UK performance was weaker than planned. Sales grew by 6.2%, supported by excellent new store performance, but trading profit declined by 1.0 %. The issue we are addressing is that the shopping trip just hasn't been improving fast enough and our standards haven't been as consistent as our customers have come to expect. As a result, we are taking action to improve each aspect of the customer offer. This will involve significant revenue and capital investment in a comprehensive plan encompassing six key areas. The UK Plan - Building a Better Tesco Our Plan for the UK business has six elements: Service & Staff: helping our people deliver great service by investment in recruitment, training and equipment, dedicated to particular departments such as produce so that our customers notice the change. Stores & Formats: making our stores better places in which to shop and work, with the pace of new store development moderating, and the pace of refreshing our existing stores stepping up. Price & Value: delivering great value for money through the right blend of price, promotions, couponing and loyalty. Range & Quality: building the right ranges of quality products, reviewing and refreshing our entire range of Tesco brand products, making our ranging more store and format-specific, and bringing dunnhumby, our marketing insight business, back into the heart of Tesco. Brand & Marketing: making sure that we get back to having the right conversation with our customers about Tesco. Clicks & Bricks: making this a potent combination for our customers, with the roll-out of Click & Collect and the transformation of our range and online presence. Chief Executive's review 4 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 We are clear on what we need to do, we have trialled substantial elements of the changes and we know they work. Our investment programme has already started and we expect this to deliver stronger results. The Big Price Drop in September 2011 was the first step, but the changes we are making are about much more than price. They are a combination of price, quality, range and service, including a significant investment to create an additional 20,000 jobs over the next two years. These changes will reinvigorate the shopping trip for customers, and consequently deliver improved performance for shareholders. To be an outstanding international retailer in stores and online Our international businesses performed strongly, with trading profits up 18%, or by 22% before the impact of a crisis tax levied in Hungary. We have seen progress in our established businesses, such as in Central Europe, South Korea and Thailand, and from our newer, rapidly growing businesses, such as Fresh & Easy in the United States and Tesco Malaysia. It is encouraging that we are winning market share in almost all of our markets and, in some countries, at a faster rate than for many years. Asia: another strong performance I am pleased with the performance of our businesses in Asia. Sales and profit grew well - sales by over 10%, and trading profit by over 20%. We delivered solid like-for-like sales growth and an excellent contribution from new stores. Our business in Thailand had an extraordinary year. The worst flooding for 70 years caused us to close over 150 stores temporarily and all four of our distribution depots. The superb dedication of our team enabled us to keep supply lines open for customers and to support staff affected by the flooding, and we have come out of the crisis stronger. We grew like-for-like sales and profits in the year. South Korea had another good year, although I anticipate a modest reduction in like-for-like sales next year as restrictions on trading hours for large retailers are implemented across the country. In China, we have continued to focus on building scale in three regions of the country. With the economic environment currently proving challenging for mainstream retailers, we have decided to take a more cautious stance on the market, at least for now. We have decided not to commit substantial new capital to freehold shopping centres, and we have also elected to hold back on the pace of new hypermarket development this year. We will only open 16 stores, instead of stepping up as we had planned. We still believe that China can be an engine of growth and we can speed up again when the outlook improves. We took an important step this year in deciding to exit Japan. It is right to focus on our larger, profitable and growing businesses in the Asia region. It is never easy to make decisions of this kind and I would like to thank our staff in Japan for their continued hard work and professionalism through this time. Europe: growth in a difficult environment Following a strong performance in Europe in the first half of the year, the performance in the second half was weaker than expected. Sales for the year grew by 8% and trading profit increased marginally, by 0.4%. Trading profit growth would have been in line with sales had it not been for the impact of the crisis tax imposed in Hungary, which cost PS38 million in the year. The economic background was particularly difficult in Hungary and in the Republic of Ireland this year. Given the current conditions, we are focusing on growth primarily through our existing stores in these markets, rather than investing substantial new capital. In addition to these headwinds in two of our largest markets, profits were held back by disruption connected to the opening of our new distribution centre in Poland, but this is behind us now. We have made good progress with the closer integration of our European businesses this year, from sharing infrastructure to buying as a single region. This means that we can leverage the skill and scale of the Tesco Group to deliver a better shopping trip for customers and higher returns for shareholders. One example of this is our recent launch of grocery dotcom in Prague, with initial sales well ahead of plan, and our dotcom business in Warsaw will be launched soon. Our Extra format stores delivered an encouraging performance through the year United States: on the path to profitability It has been a year of encouraging progress in Fresh & Easy. Sales grew by 27%, with almost 12 percentage points coming from like-for-like stores. We have also delivered reduced trading losses for the first time, with an 18% improvement on last year. After four years of rising losses, this is a decisive change of trend, driven by further improvements to our customer offer. Features such as in-store bakeries, more loose produce, additional ranges and new Fresh & Easy products have been very popular with customers and we have seen an acceleration in our already strong growth in customer numbers. The progress we have made gives us more confidence that we will deliver a further significant reduction in losses in the coming year. The timing of break-even will be later than we had previously expected, as we will focus on getting more of our existing stores to reach profitability before we step up the rate of new store openings. We can then reach sufficient scale to cover our substantial central overhead costs and we anticipate that we will reach the break-even point during 2013 14. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 5 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review Strategy in action Business model To be as strong in everything we sell as we are in food It has been tough to achieve growth in sales of discretionary items - not least in the UK, where we have seen a number of specialist general merchandise retailers go into administration - and our UK like-for-like growth in general merchandise, clothing and electricals has remained negative. To adjust to this, we have been allocating more space to the most popular products and improving merchandising. We are committing less capital to new space for non-food and instead focusing more resource on continuing to develop our online capability. We are seeing the early benefits of our changes, but much remains to be done Europe and Asia delivered stronger performances in general merchandise, clothing and electricals, despite subdued consumer confidence even in the better performing economies. I was pleased with the performance of clothing in Central Europe, with sales growing by 12% at constant exchange rates. This is testament to the strength of the F&F brand and also to the performance of our new Extra format stores. We ended the year with 44 of the new Extras in Europe and three in Asia. These stores are introducing our customers to a different way of shopping, with stronger ranging and new services, with extremely encouraging results. Different categories of food and general merchandise have their own distinctive look and feel within the Extra store, known as 'Worlds', such as Baby World and Sports World. We are making similar changes to the look and feel within our large UK stores, partly as a result of the encouraging performances in Europe. To grow retail services in all our markets Tesco Bank is a key part of the potential we see in retail services. Since we took full control of the Bank in 2008, our focus has been on developing our own systems and infrastructure and recruiting and developing a new team to run the operation. I'm delighted to say that this period of migration from The Royal Bank of Scotland 'RBS' to our own platforms is now nearing an end. Building a bank is a complex task and I took the decision during the year to slow down the migration, so as to minimise the customer impact. This final stage of migration will be completed imminently, at which point the business can put more emphasis on growth and on developing the potential we see in financial services. We have delivered good business growth in the year with revenue up 14%, driven by a good performance in the insurance business. The Bank's profit figure includes several accounting adjustments, so we measure business performance using baseline profitability, which increased by a very encouraging 29%. The Bank's capital position has also remained strong through the year, supported by a 7% growth in savings balances. With the migration almost completed, the Bank is well positioned for future growth. We are also on track to launch new products, starting with mortgages, to broaden into a full-service retail bank. Customers can purchase insurance and other Tesco Bank products in store, alongside their weekly shop Chief Executive's review 6 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 To put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do We have reinforced our commitment to be a good corporate citizen this year: as a retailer, an employer and a neighbour. We employ over half a million people worldwide, which allows us to make a real difference in the communities where we operate. Our core business involves two vital roles in the heart of the community: providing customers with safe, good quality, affordable, nutritious food and creating good jobs and careers. Beyond this, we have demonstrated that we put our responsibilities to communities at the heart of what we do in a huge variety of ways: I want to pay tribute to just some of the great achievements of the last year. Even when their own homes were in danger or flooded, our people in Thailand went to extraordinary lengths for customers. Some even gave up their days off and travelled for hours by boat to continue to get essential supplies to our customers. There is no better example of our colleagues living true to the Tesco Values: 'No one tries harder for customers' and 'Treat people how we like to be treated'. Our responsibility to our people is to provide them with good jobs and careers. In the last year, we have created thousands of jobs across our businesses, invested in a state-of-the-art, zero-carbon training academy in South Korea and have continued our work in the employment of young people, university graduates and the long-term unemployed. Our customer offering is based on strong relationships with our suppliers. For example, we now have supplier academies in all of our Central European markets for suppliers to present their products to our buyers. This enables us to support the growth of our suppliers whilst sourcing the best local and regional products for our customers. Any business on the scale of Tesco has the opportunity to make a significant difference in tackling climate change. We were proud to be recognised by the Carbon Disclosure Project again this year, with Tesco named the top retailer in the world. We will continue our work as we progress towards our ambitious target of being a zero-carbon business by 2050. Our state-of-the-art, zero-carbon training academy in South Korea, to train staff from across the Tesco Group To be a creator of highly valued brands Finest sold well over PS1 billion in the UK alone this year. In April 2012 we relaunched Tesco Value as Everyday Value, with quality improvements to hundreds of products Across our markets our own-label programme encompasses a broad spectrum of ranges to appeal to diverse customer needs, giving customers the quality products they are looking for at competitive prices. In the last year we have expanded our offering, launching new ranges such as Venture Brands in the UK and Europe - including Chokablok chocolate and ice cream and Carousel children's toys - which offer customers premium quality at great prices. We have started to differentiate our ranges more clearly, such as our sub-brands Gourmet and Eat Well in Fresh & Easy and Goodness, which is a range of healthy and nutritious children's products now also available in the UK. We recently relaunched our UK Tesco Value range as Everyday Value, with quality improvements to hundreds of products and new, brighter packaging. This is the first stage in a refresh of our entire range of over 8,000 Tesco brand products in the UK in the next two years, including a comprehensive update to our Tesco Standard range. This is an area of substantial and growing strategic importance for us, as we recognise the role that our brands play in attracting customers and as we start to leverage our expertise in brand management across our markets. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 7 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review Strategy in action Business model To build our team so that we create more value Strengthening our management This time last year we were in the early days of some of our new management structures. I had just introduced a matrix structure throughout Tesco with CEOs for each of our key business areas - the UK, Asia, Europe, and the US - supported by integrating functions, such as Property, Human Resources and Marketing. I am very pleased with how this structure has bedded in and expect to see even greater value creation as a result. The introduction of a dedicated UK Operating Board has enabled greater focus at home and given the importance of the changes we are currently making for customers, I have recently decided to assume direct responsibility for the UK business during the process of its renewal. I have continued to strengthen both the Executive Committee and our senior management teams through the last year, drawing on our deep pool of internal talent. We have also been fortunate to welcome our new Chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, following Sir David Reid's decision to retire. I want to thank David for his lasting contribution to Tesco over 26 years on our Board and, on a personal level, for all the help he has given me in settling into my role as CEO. Building the Tesco team We will create 20,000 more jobs in the UK over the next two years and many more around the world Tesco's most important asset will always be its people, who live by our Values to do their very best for customers. Many of our plans for the coming year are built on investment in our people. We employ more than half a million people across the globe and this will continue to increase, with plans to create an additional 20,000 jobs in the UK alone in the coming two years and to continue to grow our teams around the world. It is the quality, commitment and dedication of our people that gives me so much confidence that we can and will achieve our plans for the years ahead. Delivering higher returns In April last year we set out a target to increase our already good level of ROCE to 14.6% by 2014 15. Although it is likely that we will see a small reduction in 2012 13 as a result of our UK investment plans, we continue to see a number of opportunities to drive returns and we still expect to deliver our targeted increase to 14.6% by 2014 15. Doing the right thing I am confident that we are ready to tackle whatever challenges lie ahead. The decisive action that we have taken in the past year and the management changes which have reinvigorated the Tesco team have laid the ground for the future: a future where we will make sure that our capital and our talent are put to work where it benefits most our customers and hence our shareholders. We have and will continue to focus on doing the right thing for customers, for communities, for staff, for the business and for our shareholders. Philip Clarke Chief Executive Chief Executive's review 8 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 Strategy in action Having given you an overview of the implementation of our strategy over the past year, this section sets out some detailed case studies showing our strategy in action. In the next few pages, you'll read about the PS1 billion commitment we're making to improve the shopping trip in the UK, our exciting innovations online, what we mean by Group skill and scale, our businesses in newer markets, the progress of Tesco Bank over the last three years and our team's extraordinary response to the flooding in Thailand.

Focusing on food first, we are making a PS1 billion commitment this year to improve the shopping trip, driving a strong pace of improvement in the things that matter for customers - service, range, quality, price, availability and the store environment. Creating more good jobs and careers Over the next two years, we will create 20,000 new jobs to deliver new levels of excellence in customer service. Customers will benefit from more staff on the shop floor at busy times, greater staff expertise and enhanced service across the store. The investment goes to the heart of our promise to create good jobs and careers, with opportunities focused on young people who are currently unemployed. British Prime Minister David Cameron described the investment as \"a massive confidence boost for the UK economy\". The Fruit and Veg team Fresh food is an area where customers really appreciate having dedicated, specially trained and knowledgeable staff. With the additional investment in staffing, training and equipment, the Fruit and Veg team can focus on fresh produce, improving product availability and presentation for customers. We are also increasing the number of staff across the whole of fresh food - meat, produce and chilled convenience foods. More staff, better service One of the largest elements of our investment is in increased staffing levels, training and equipment for key departments in existing stores - such as produce and meat. We saw marked improvements in customers' perceptions and sales performance of 200 pilot stores. This success has given us the confidence to move quickly to apply these changes to all of our large stores - an investment of over PS200 million. We are improving the look and feel of many of our fresh departments using more engaging signage, stronger graphics, warmer colours and better lighting 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 The Big Price Drop In September 2011, we launched The Big Price Drop, investing more than PS500 million to reduce the prices of over 3,000 everyday products. Big Price Drops target the products that customers buy week in, week out. The progress is encouraging and we're now more competitive. It's an important step in the journey but there's more to do to get the blend right on price, promotions, couponing and loyalty. Quality and innovation We are reviewing and refreshing our entire range of over 8,000 Tesco brand products starting with the relaunch of Tesco Value as Everyday Value, with quality improvements to hundreds of products. Helping customers manage on tight budgets, Value was already growing at twice the rate of the market as a whole: these changes will further strengthen its position. We will also be comprehensively updating our other Tesco ranges this year. We have already stepped up the pace of innovation with our new Venture Brand exclusive products - such as Chokablok ice cream, Parioli authentic Italian ranges and the Latham's range of premium pet food. With such a strong variety of ranges to appeal to the needs of different customers, we will also be applying more personalisation and localisation in stores to help them tailor their ranges much more for their local area. Over the page Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 11 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review Strategy in action Business model 11 UK: Refreshing our stores for customers and staff The way stores look and feel is an important part of the shopping trip. Customers wanted a warmer, friendlier look and feel, so we have accelerated our Refresh programme to improve the environment in all our stores. Bakery Customers love being able to choose from freshly baked breads and cakes and see our bakers at work in the background. Displaying the goods in baskets, not on standard shelves, also helps to make our bakeries much more appealing. Investing over PS200 million of additional capital, we will refresh 430 stores in the coming year, representing about 25% of our UK space. Bringing in a warmer, friendlier look and feel will go hand in hand with our work on quality and range, so that we offer customers great products displayed in an attractive, inviting store environment. Listening to our staff Most of our changes are visible to customers but we are making some equally important changes behind the scenes. We ran a programme this year for staff to email or text in comments about what they felt needed to be fixed in their stores. With 40,000 comments received, we'five responded by rolling out new and better equipment, like checkout chairs and handheld printers. This has helped deliver the best staff Viewpoint feedback survey results for five years. The Extra format Customers are noticing the changes we are making in stores across all of our formats - Extra, Superstores, Metro and Express - but we're also making some changes that particularly affect our larger stores. We're drawing on the great success of our new Extra format in Europe to make sure that our UK Extras continue to meet our customers' changing needs, as they increasingly combine shopping in store and online. Future investment In the last few years, both convenience and online shopping have been growing rapidly. While our existing large stores in the UK perform very well, recognising the current economic climate and the growing importance of online shopping, we are not planning to open many more of the very biggest. Instead, more of our investment is going into refreshing our existing stores. New investment will be channelled into Express stores and our online offer. Fixtures and fittings, lighting and space We are refreshing our stores, inside and out, to make them more inviting. Wooden cladding and brighter signage welcome customers into the store. Inside, different areas are being given a more distinctive look and feel, such as wooden fixtures in Bakery, or sleek shelving and lighting in Health & Beauty. Our produce aisles are more spacious, and our counters have less functional, more engaging signage, flat glass fronts and better lighting, to show off our meat, fish, cheese and deli products at their best.

We will add 700 new collection points for Tesco Direct orders in the next year - customers can already collect from over 770 stores, including 70 Express stores. We will also continue to increase the number of stores with collection points for grocery, as well as trialling convenient joint collection points. Clothing The UK clothing market, worth PS33 billion, is one of the few areas of discretionary spend that continues to grow and is a category where the internet has so far had a limited impact. Our Central European Extras have shown us that Clothing tends to benefit from more space and better lighting on the shop floor, as customers love seeing more of our range. As well as giving Clothing more space in store, we will be improving the ranges and quality we offer to ensure broad appeal. Retail services The services we offer in store - like an optician, pharmacy, phone shop or customer restaurant - all help customers to get more out of their everyday shopping trip. We ended the year with over 180 opticians and are planning to increase the number of our phone shops to over 260 in the coming year. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 13 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review Strategy in action Business model Online grocery When we first launched a grocery home shopping service in 1997 we were viewed as pioneers, and we have grown to be the world's largest and most profitable online grocery retailer with sales of well over PS2 billion. As technology moves forward so do we. We use it to help make shopping easier for customers with a mobile web platform for shopping on the go, features like 'Favourites' and tailored online offers developed for Tesco via analysis from dunnhumby, our marketing insight business. Where customer demand is very high we have complemented our in-store picking model with a number of specialised dotcom-only stores. In January, we opened our fourth in Enfield. We currently fulfil over 80% of London orders from our dotcom-only stores, providing our customers with our total food range - more than can be offered from any one store. Growing our online businesses in all our markets is a strategic priority for us and it shows how we are adapting to our customers' changing needs. Stores continue to sit at the heart of our business, but we are aiming to become a multi-channel retailer wherever we trade. Customers increasingly expect to be able to shop where, when and how they want: the boundary between stores and online is blurring. In developing our online offer, we are drawing on our convenient store network and our expertise to meet our customers' needs and help make their lives easier, progressing towards an offering where customers can shop with us 'anywhere, any time, any how'. We'five taken online far beyond everyday grocery shopping. Digital technology allows us to meet the 'on the go' needs of our customers - with you can stream entertainment on the move and with our virtual stores in South Korea you can even shop during your commute to work. We want to offer our customers convenient options to shop with us using those access points - stores, computers and mobile devices - which are part of their daily lives. Whether customers want to shop on the move using their smartphones, or take their time at home, we are innovating to help them shop however they want, with quick and easy apps and improved platforms. Tesco Direct We have upgraded our Tesco Direct website to better showcase our great quality range and offer customers improved functionality and ease of use. For the first time it is now configured for mobile devices. We will be moving our other UK Clothing and Entertainment websites onto the same platform later in the year. By Christmas we will have increased our Direct range to 200,000 items, thanks in part to third-party Sellers. Having introduced our first Sellers at Tesco Direct recently, we are offering our customers additional ranges teamed with Clubcard points and convenient store collection points, while our Seller Partners benefit from our volume of online traffic and expertise.

In the next few years, we are planning to launch online grocery shopping in at least one major city in each of our markets, using our operating model to roll this out quickly and cost-effectively. In Asia, we're innovating to access the biggest opportunities - for example, in addition to our online grocery service, our virtual stores in South Korea enable busy customers to shop on their way to work. The Homeplus app has been downloaded over a million times. Social media As our customers spend an increasing amount of time online we are able to use social media to build trust and understanding of our business. This in turn helps to drive loyalty. We have built our business on listening to our customers and acting on their feedback. Social media allows us to have conversations with them on any issue at any time - in the UK, we now have more than 680,000 'likes' on our Facebook page. In 2011 we acquired BzzAgent - a unique business combining word-of-mouth marketing with a commercial application of social media, helping to drive consumer advocacy and broaden our capability and innovation in product marketing. Social media also helps us to be more effective and innovative in existing tasks such as recruitment and staff communication. For example, our staff use Yammer - a private social network for businesses - to share best practice and celebrate success, often by posting photos, and we use it operationally for sharing messages and asking for feedback. Click & Collect Click & Collect is a key component of our multi-channel offering. Our store and distribution networks mean we can give customers the opportunity to pick up products whenever it suits them from over 770 stores, close to where they live or work. 70% of online general merchandise orders are handled in this way. Click & Collect is becoming increasingly relevant for all product groups. We currently have 45 stores that offer grocery Click & Collect and we expect this number to increase quickly. Our customers appreciate this innovative, quick and convenient service which fits well into their busy schedules. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 15 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review Strategy in action Business model Consistent property blueprints As we continue to grow our international businesses there is a significant opportunity to make savings from applying standardised property blueprints. With the same specialist team designing the stores, we can build great stores for customers more quickly, more cheaply and with a reduced carbon footprint. We also ensure the new space is best used by reducing the space given to offices and chillers in the back, providing more room on the shop floor. Customers love local and regional products: we pride ourselves on having local people running our operations: and we use local knowledge to source and to allocate space to the most popular products. However, lots of what we do - especially behind the scenes - is best done in the same way across our markets. We are increasingly realising our vision to win locally by applying our skills globally. 'Group skill and scale' describes this step in our evolution to becoming a global business. By Group skill, we mean applying expertise from individual countries to all of our markets: Clubcard is a great example. Having invested millions of pounds to develop the UK scheme in the late 1990s, we have been able to introduce a loyalty scheme to each of our markets for a fraction of the cost. By Group scale, we mean using the size of the Tesco business to benefit our customers by lowering prices, improving quality, and sourcing new and different products from the best suppliers around the world. Globally sourcing food, general merchandise, and the goods that we use in store is one way that we are doing this. We buy some products from the same source for all our markets, such as bananas, and we buy others for a whole region, such as F&F clothing for Central Europe. Buying on a larger scale means that we can achieve a better cost price and create headroom to invest in improving the shopping trip for customers. Since the mid-1990s, we have built an international business of more than 3,200 stores, which delivered more than PS1 billion trading profit for the first time this year. As we strive to become an outstanding international retailer, we are drawing on Tesco's skill and scale to move into the next phase of growth. International: Moving into the next phase of growth Since the mid-1990s, we have built an international business with more stores than we have in the UK, which has delivered more than PS1 billion trading profit for the first time - larger than any of our UK competitors. With strong market positions, we are well positioned to move into the next phase of growth. 11 12 trading profit excludes Japan, which has been treated as discontinued following our decision to sell the business. 10 11 has been re-presented to be consistent.

These formats are not only great for customers but are also cost-effective, utilising our existing distribution networks and requiring less capital. One platform, many markets - the best everywhere Rolling out the same processes and systems across the Group delivers a better shopping trip for lower cost. Shelf-ready packaging and best practice replenishment processes support great availability for customers in store, while warehouse processes minimise stock loss and wastage. We increase back-office efficiency through our shared service centre in India with the same team designing common features, such as self-service checkouts, for all our markets. Reaping the benefits of centralised distribution As we buy more and more products on a regional or global scale, it becomes easier and more effective to organise our distribution across borders. We have opened new depots in Poland and China this year, building them to a Group blueprint and implementing best practice processes, equipment and systems. Rolling out services At year end, we had 47 of our Extra format stores internationally. These stores offer customers a whole range of services, such as photo shops, opticians and phone shops, for relatively low investment as they use existing hypermarket space and customer footfall. Retail financial services are well established in Thailand and South Korea, where Tesco partners with leading financial services providers, and in an earlier stage of development in another seven of our markets. Invest in the best local offer Identify best practice and roll out in all markets Work together where it makes sense Winning locally, applying our skills globally Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 17 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review Strategy in action Business model Diversity and complexity A market of China's scale brings not only significant opportunities but also huge diversity and complexity. To be successful, we need a deep understanding of regional, provincial and city-level differences, as well as an ability to leverage our global expertise and systems in order to build scale. Our vision of winning locally by applying our skills globally is key to our ambition to drive long-term, sustainable growth in China. The importance of being local... Even within a single region temperatures, tastes and preferred brands can all vary, so our operation is 'local' in many ways. For example, our buying teams are based in different regions and even in specific provinces and cities to be close to our customers and suppliers. We have appointed more local Directors this year to strengthen our China Board and have ongoing plans to recruit and develop local talent.... and operating responsibly Our stores are active in their local communities, for example through 'Care for the Needy', where we donate daily essentials to elderly and infirm people. Drawing on our Group expertise and technologies, our new distribution centre in Jiashan uses 45% less energy than a traditional depot. These are just two examples of how we operate responsibly through a combination of being local and applying our skills globally. Group skill and scale Tesco's skill and scale are crucial to differentiating our business in China. Our new distribution centre was an important first step to streamlining our supply chain, allowing us to buy on a greater scale and giving us more control over the storage and transportation of fresh produce. Drawing on our brand capabilities, we have recently relaunched the packaging for 250 of our own-brand products, with hundreds more to follow in the coming year. Our Shenyang Extra store has benefited from the success of our new format in Europe, with the senior team trained in our Extra store in Bratislava, Slovakia. Our strategy in China is to focus on building scale in three regions which together have a population of over 600 million. China: three regions the size of countries North region Hymall opened here in 2001 and 11 years later we have 39 stores trading. Our first Extra opened in Shenyang in December.

We have made changes this year to bring out these features and give them more prominence in our stores. With a friendlier store environment and atmosphere, the quality of our fresh and prepared produce more apparent and the launch of our Friends card to thank our loyal customers, we have driven 12% like-for-like sales growth this year and total sales growth of 27%. The journey to profitability The results of these changes mean that we are more confident about the outlook for the business, although clearly much remains to be done. We have reduced trading losses by 18% and are on track for another significant reduction in 2012 13, even if the timing of break-even will now be later than our earlier expectation. This is because we will focus on more stores reaching profitability first, before pushing on faster with the expansion we need to create sufficient scale to cover our overheads. We ended the year with 185 stores and will have approaching 230 stores by the end of the coming year. The changes we have made to stores this year are building real momentum in Fresh & Easy, driving growing customer numbers and sales and delivering reduced losses for the first time.

In just over three years we have developed a completely new infrastructure for the business, built up a new team and brought in new expertise - effectively building a new bank from scratch. We are now completing the very final stages of this huge project, as we move towards offering a full-service retail bank. At its core, Tesco Bank is underpinned by the Tesco brand and Clubcard, and its operations are effective because of our people, systems and IT. Being part of Tesco delivers benefits for customers and Tesco Bank. For example, the insight we gain from Clubcard allows us to understand our customers' needs well, helping us to provide them with the most relevant offers in a clear and simple way and at a great price. Tesco Clubcard credit card rewards customers with Clubcard points whenever they use their card. Clubcard customers can also receive preferential deals when buying Tesco Bank products - including discounts on car, home, pet and travel insurance - and can use Clubcard points to buy Tesco Bank insurance. This year, Tesco Bank gave customers around PS70 million of Clubcard points to spend in store or on Clubcard rewards. The Tesco Values sit at the heart of Tesco Bank. Our core purpose is 'To create value for customers to earn their lifetime loyalty', so our people focus on providing great customer service. At our Glasgow and Newcastle customer service centres, staff are not incentivised to sell, which means that discussions with customers can focus solely on meeting their banking and insurance needs. Over the last three years, we have built a strong team with experience and expertise, growing dramatically from 300 to 2,800 people. In terms of systems and IT, our new platforms have enabled some significant customer service improvements. Instant decisions are now available on loan applications, and customers can open and fund savings accounts in just ten minutes, which had previously taken around two weeks. While we have completed the majority of the transition from The Royal Bank of Scotland's 'RBS' systems and platforms to our own, we did encounter some technical issues during the summer of 2011. We pride ourselves on being a bank that customers can rely on and trust, and to ensure that the continuing process was as smooth as possible for customers and staff, we decided to slow the remaining transition of our 2.8 million credit card accounts. This is now nearing completion. Even with all this work going on, we have grown the business during 2011 12. The savings book was up 7% versus a market of 3%, and the underlying performance of the Bank remained good, with strong growth in baseline profit which excludes key nontrading provisioning movements. In the last three years, we have seen significant growth across key Bank products. We have laid our foundations for growth and, with the transition from RBS almost complete, we are now in a position to grow the business faster. Tesco Bank brings Tesco's Values, customer focus and trusted brand name to a big market and is differentiated by being a bank that has Tesco at its centre. We offer simple, convenient, value for money products in what can be a highly complex market. Savings and loans: Our savings book continues to grow well, with retail savings deposits increasing by around PS330 million this year. Clubcard insight supports our competitive customer offering and high quality loan book. Even though loan balances have been temporarily reduced this year as we have undergone migration, customer accounts in loans and savings have increased by 30% since 2008. We are continuing to attract new customers who know that the Bank is reliable, trustworthy and good value. Retail services: A Tesco Bank for Tesco customers 20 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 Insurance: Our products help support customers in their daily lives, giving them peace of mind wherever they are. Simple to understand, our range of products continues to prove popular with customers. Around 1.5 million people now insure their cars and homes with Tesco Bank. Since 2008, our car insurance gross written premiums have increased by 39% and pet insurance gross written premiums are up by 44%. Transaction services: Our transaction services - ATMs and travel bureaux - offer customers convenience while they are on the go. Both saw strong growth in the year, with ATM transactions up 9% and travel money transactions up 12%. We ended the year with 3,265 ATMs, up from 2,600 three years ago, and we have close to 200 travel bureaux across our store network. Credit cards: We are increasing our share of the market, with 57% growth in credit card transactions since 2008. Three years ago, Tesco Bank credit cards made up 9% of all MasterCard and Visa credit card transactions in the UK - that figure is now 12%. Customers benefit from the added 'Tesco' extras that come with their credit card, such as collecting one Clubcard point for every PS4 spent. Rates are subject to change and are correct as at April 2012. Fixed rate saver: one-off payment and money cannot be withdrawn until the end of the term. New products: Tesco Bank has been growing well even without new product launches, but the products we'five launched on our own systems have enjoyed huge success. Our Fixed Rate Saver, launched in October 2010, has grown to PS1.5 billion and our retail bonds have attracted investments of PS185 million. These initiatives diversify our funding base and increase the long-term funding available to the Bank. We always want to give our customers the best products and the best experience, so we believe getting it right at launch is more important than rushing the process. Once we have completed the final stage of migration, we can push on faster with more substantial new products, starting with mortgages. Current accounts are planned to follow and we welcome the recommendation of the Independent Commission on Banking to make it easier for customers to switch between banks.

We are committed to being a good neighbour and making a difference to the communities we live and work in, including supporting the causes that matter to our customers and our people. In 2011, Thailand suffered its worst floods in 70 years. At Tesco Lotus our staff went to incredible lengths through immensely difficult conditions to get essential supplies into our stores for customers. Events such as the floods are a reminder of the strength of local communities and how people turn to them in times of need. They are also a reminder of the importance of providing customers with good quality, safe, affordable food, whenever they need it. 22 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 Like all Thai retailers, we faced a major challenge with the flood crisis but at Tesco Lotus the team worked incredibly hard to find ways to get products into store and support local people. Our people came into work even when their own homes were flooded. We used trains and planes to bring products in and worked together across the Group to secure deliveries. Tesco in Malaysia provided three million litres of water and eight million packets of noodles and our global suppliers helped to secure canned fish, eggs and UHT milk. We used our stores as donation centres for customers who wanted to support flood victims and contributed almost PS500,000 of essential products. For our staff affected, we provided financial support as well as relief bags, food, temporary accommodation and transport. Through teamwork at Tesco Lotus and the support of the Group, we were able to help the people of Thailand during this difficult time - a recovery effort that is still continuing. I would like to thank the whole team again for their extraordinary dedication.

Insight: Improving the customer offer Listening to customers in a wide variety of ways is key to what we do. We engage with customers through a range of focus groups and ongoing research trackers, and actively seek feedback on what is good or not so good, such as through our Every Comment Helps scheme in the UK. Online and social media make it easier to listen and respond to large numbers of customers in real time, through webchats, Facebook and Twitter. The insight from all of these conversations increasingly feeds into the customer offer so that we can continually drive incremental improvements for customers. Our loyalty schemes, such as Clubcard or Legou Tesco Membercard in China, are not only great for our customers but also provide data insight to enable us to continually improve the shopping trip. With a loyalty scheme in all of our markets and around 44 million active customers in total, we are in a unique position to understand customers' shopping patterns. Our marketing insight business, dunnhumby, provides analysis which we feed back into our business model, shaping our product and range development and enabling us to offer customers the best products and promotions for their particular needs. Buy: A great range of products In food, general merchandise and services, we work with our suppliers and develop our brands to bring a great range to our customers. The relationship with our suppliers is the foundation of our customer offer. We work with a broad range of suppliers, from global produce suppliers and international FMCG companies to local suppliers who provide products for a single region in one of our markets. We sell over PS1 billion of local products annually in the UK and, across Europe, our series of 'meet the buyer' events helped us to stock hundreds of new local products this year. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 25 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review Strategy in action Business model Business model With our established private label programme, we produce great quality Tesco brands at a range of price points, from Everyday Value up to Finest. Our product brands also have established market positions. For example, F&F, which is the market leader in clothing in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, is itself diversified into distinct subbrands for different clothing styles. In services, we often work with specialist partners to source the best product offerings. For example, we created a joint venture between Vodafone and Tesco Hungary this year, and Tesco Bank insurance underwriting is primarily provided in partnership with Ageas Insurance Limited. Move: The right products at the right time Our network of distribution centres 'DCs' and advanced technology support a modern, efficient and cost-effective supply chain. An efficient distribution system starts with understanding which products our stores need. First, we forecast what customers will buy, using sophisticated, detailed models to consider variables such as seasonality, weather forecasts and likely response to promotions. Second, our ordering systems automatically update in real time based on what customers do actually buy, so that we can quickly and accurately supply stores with the right products at the right time. We plan our distribution processes, systems and network of DCs to maximise efficiency. Labour scheduling and transport planning systems enable our pickers and drivers to operate highly effectively, and we develop our distribution networks to minimise the mileage needed to get products to store in perfect condition. We also use transport other than lorries such as our four train services in the UK, which save 15,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. Continually striving to make every part of the process productive, through primary distribution, we use our network to pick products up from some of our suppliers and transport them to our depots, which can be more cost-effective than individual suppliers delivering to us. We also use return journeys from stores to depots to pick up waste materials which we sell for recycling. Sell: The best shopping trip Whether in store, online or a combination of both, we pride ourselves on delivering a great shopping trip for our customers, week in, week out. One of Tesco's Values is 'No one tries harder for customers', and this can be seen in how we strive to improve the shopping trip. This represents every element of the customer shopping experience, including price, range, quality, availability and service. Our loyalty schemes are key to the customer offering, thanking customers each time they shop at Tesco. We take a multi-format approach to our store network, to be able to meet our customers' needs for different types of shopping trip, from large Extra stores that offer a full range of food, general merchandise and services, to Metro and Express convenience stores. 'Selling' refers to a broader and broader range of activities as we develop our multi-channel offer. We launched a grocery home shopping service in the UK in 1997. Since then, we have grown this business to over PS2 billion of annual sales, launched grocery home shopping in South Korea, the Republic of Ireland and the Czech Republic, and launched further online businesses, such as Direct, Clothing and Entertainment. We are increasingly offering customers the option of combining stores and online with Click & Collect, which makes the most of our convenient store locations, giving customers an easy way to pick up products ordered online. We also offer a wide range of services to our customers. With opticians, pharmacies and phone shops available in our larger stores, and Tesco Bank products available to buy in store, over the phone or online, we are deepening our customers' relationship with Tesco, bringing our values of convenience, simplicity, reliability and great customer service into what can be complex markets. We don't always sell our products ourselves. In South Korea and the Czech Republic, we operate franchise chains alongside our own stores, and we have also recently announced a new franchise model for our F&F clothing brand in Saudi Arabia. The virtuous volume circle By keeping our customer focus central to our business model, we are able to provide a leading customer offer: a broad range of products and services at great prices, sold in shops in convenient locations and, increasingly, available online. A great customer offer drives the virtuous volume circle, which means that we can continuously improve our offer. By selling more products, we are able to work with our suppliers to drive mutually beneficial economies of scale, creating headroom to invest and to offer lower prices to customers. An important element of our Plan to improve business performance in the UK is centred on investing in the shopping trip so that customers will reward us by buying more from Tesco. Enablers Our core business model is supported by enablers which maximise the potential of our core activities to give our customers the best shopping trip and ensure that our activities are carried out in a sustainable way. Leveraging Group skill and scale: Making our business Better, Simpler, Cheaper, Faster Sharing best practice systems, processes and approaches across all of our markets takes our business model to the next level. By identifying best practice in each market, we can improve our offering around the Group. For example, some of the very popular brands we have developed in Fresh & Easy in the US have recently been introduced into the UK and South Korea. As our international experience grows, we are increasingly benefitting from sharing best practice - with our UK Operating Board all having spent some of their careers in our international businesses. Business model 26 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 Group skill and scale supports each of our core activities: utilising Insight, Buying, Moving and Selling. Utilising Insight as a Group, with a loyalty scheme in all of our markets, means we can continually innovate the customer offer. Our Turkish business launched Clubcard this year, which would not normally be possible for a business of its size. Buying as a Group is cost-effective, creating headroom to invest in the customer shopping trip, such as by sourcing consumables in Central Europe as a Group. Moving as a Group, with distribution centre blueprints, systems, and the early stages of borderless distribution, makes our deliveries simpler and faster, with new distribution centres opened in both Poland and China this year. Selling as a Group, with our Extra format already in eight international markets, including the Czech Republic, Thailand and China, offers customers a better shopping experience. Of course we don't believe in 'one size fits all'. There are many things that are best done locally because customer tastes and lifestyles are not uniform. Our businesses are run predominantly by local teams, not by expats, so that our operations can be close to the customers we serve, and our local ranges both support our smaller suppliers and give customers a tailored product offering. Developing our people: Our most important asset Great service can make a customer's day, and we achieve this when our people live the Tesco Values: 'No one tries harder for customers' and 'Treat people how we like to be treated'. Our business is built on the commitment of more than half a million people across the world and, in return for their commitment, we offer them good jobs and careers with Tesco. Developing our people takes many forms, from training in our state-of-the-art training academy in Asia, to offering jobs to the long-term unemployed through Regeneration Partnerships and supporting the development of women to management positions. Creating valuable property: The best located and best designed stores Our site research and property capabilities enable us to identify and develop the best sites for our stores. Tesco has great depth of experience in property development all around the world. Optimal sites for new store developments and extensions are identified by our site research departments. We have a flexible approach to property acquisition, considering both freehold and leasehold sites and assessing each opportunity on its merits. Using a range of data, such as demographics and competitor activity, we forecast sales for a new store to a high degree of accuracy, so that we can develop the stores with the greatest potential. Once a site has been identified, approved and secured, our property development and construction teams design and develop the site. Years of experience have fed into Group-wide blueprints and specifications so that all of our development takes place to the highest standard. In many of our international markets, Tesco owns or leases whole malls, which are anchored by a Tesco hypermarket. Operating the mall and renting out the space to other retailers, cafes and cinemas creates a great destination shopping centre for customers, as well as bringing in significant rental income, which makes Tesco one of the largest mall operators in the world. Operating responsibly: Ensuring that growth is sustainable By operating responsibly, we not only benefit and secure the future of our business but we can bring real benefits to the communities in which we operate. At the heart of our commitment to operating responsibly is providing our customers with good quality, safe and affordable food. This is easily taken for granted in developed economies, but can be a real challenge in economies with low penetration of modern retail and underdeveloped supply chains. We can only achieve this by working with our suppliers to ensure our supply chain is both resilient and efficient. Strong, fair, mutually beneficial, long-term partnerships with suppliers, from local to global, are at the heart of this. The strength of our supply network was evident during the Thai floods this year, enabling us to secure essential supplies from Malaysia and other markets. We are committed to the responsible sourcing of raw materials, ensuring the resilience of our supply chain and managing our impact on the environment. We work with the wider industry on core issues, such as water scarcity, and co-chair the Sustainability Steering Group of the Consumer Goods Forum, which has pledged to help end deforestation by 2020. We aim to be a zero-carbon business by 2050 and are mapping the biggest opportunities to cut carbon in our supply chain, as well as continually exploring new energy efficiency measures to be introduced across the Group. Innovating our offer: Constantly improving our customer offer To continue to meet customers' changing needs, we are constantly innovating our offer in a whole variety of ways. Innovation can bring greater convenience to an existing way of shopping, as with self-service checkouts. It can offer customers a new way of shopping, as with Click & Collect grocery or our virtual stores in South Korea. It can combine our presence in shops and online into a compelling customer proposition: for example, a customer registered with Blinkbox can automatically receive a digital copy of most new Hollywood releases when they buy the DVD with a Clubcard in store. By drawing on the breadth of our expertise and by always putting the customer first, we continue to serve customers how they want to be served in a changing and increasingly joined-up world. Building the Tesco Brand: To be seen as the most highly valued business in the world Through everything we do, we strive towards our vision of being seen as the most highly valued business in the world - valued not only by our customers, but also by the communities we serve, our staff and our shareholders. Protecting and developing our brand reputation is the foundation of customer loyalty and of how we are seen by our many stakeholders and enables our business model to operate effectively. For example, our diversification into services such as Tesco Bank is built on customers' trust in the Tesco brand to offer good value, simple solutions and great customer service: and our recruitment and retention of great staff depends on our reputation for customer service and offering good jobs and careers.

Performance This year we reduced our rate of capital investment to reflect the challenging trading environment and increased our focus on lower capital-intensive investments with high returns, such as online and convenience. Last year we set a target of 5% to 5.5% of sales.

Going forward, a financial strategy of increased capital discipline and restraint will support the changes we are making for customers and will drive higher cash generation and higher returns for shareholders. \" Group results D Group results 2011 12 52 weeks ended 25 February 2012 2011 12 Growth Group sales inc.

In a challenging year for consumers in many of our markets, as they try to manage household budgets pressured by inflation, austerity and high fuel prices, we have made modest progress at a Group level. The international businesses performed strongly, delivering an 18% increase in profits, which helped to compensate for the reduction in trading profit in the UK. We have acted where our strategy was not delivering as we had hoped. In the United States, we reduced losses, moving towards break-even, before accelerating investment: in Japan, we announced our decision to exit the market after eight years: in China, we stepped back from the freehold shopping centre programme and have decided to hold back on the pace of new leasehold hypermarket development for the time being: at the Bank, we slowed down the migration to our own platforms to ensure it was as smooth as possible: and in the UK, we took a significant step to correct our pricing position with The Big Price Drop and, in January, acted decisively to address the underperformance in our home market. These actions will make Tesco better for our customers and are supported by a financial strategy that will also make Tesco better for shareholders.

In the UK we saw strong total sales growth driven by a good new store performance, but our like-for-like growth was disappointing, particularly in the second half of the year. This was not helped by reduced inflation resulting from our Big Price Drop and a weak Christmas, which was affected by the substantial increase in competitor couponing activity. Like-for-like sales growth recovered somewhat after Christmas. D Group results exclude the results from our operation in Japan which have been treated as discontinued following our decision to sell the business.

The combined revenue and capital investment involved in these initiatives will exceed PS1 billion, supported by a significant reset to the level of UK margins in order to give us the financial resources we need to make comprehensive improvements for customers.

Our performance in Thailand was obviously impacted by the devastating floods but the business has returned to strong growth as the country gets back to normal. Asia margins grew by over 60 basis points in the year, mainly due to the swift resolution of our insurance claim in Thailand, which has mitigated the profit impact of store closures during the flooding. South Korea and Malaysia both had a good year for sales and margin growth, although this was offset by increased losses in China where, in common with other businesses, we faced a challenging year. 08 09 PS355m PS440m PS737m 09 10 11 12 Asia trading profit PS605m 10 11 Asia results from 2011 12 exclude results from our operation in Japan which have been treated as discontinued following our decision to sell the business. 2010 11 results have been re-presented to be consistent.

Despite a strong sales performance in Poland, profits were held back by significant disruption connected to the opening of our new distribution centre and a non-food stock write-off. The crisis tax of PS38 million in Hungary had a material impact on profits. Excluding this, we saw double-digit profit growth for the Central European businesses - a pleasing performance in light of the broader economic issues affecting the eurozone. Our Irish business delivered a robust performance in the context of the severity of the recession there. The particular circumstances of the Republic of Ireland and Hungary have led us to focus on driving trade from our existing stores and we have scaled back our investment in new space. Focusing our efforts on our existing stores has driven strengthening like-for-likes and continued increases in market share in both markets. 08 09 PS496m PS474m PS529m 09 10 11 12 Europe trading profit PS527m 10 11 United States US results 2011 12 Actual rates Constant rates 2011 12 Growth Growth US sales PS638m 27.1% 31.5% US revenue exc. impact of IFRIC 13 PS630m 27.3% 31.7% US trading profit loss PS 153 m Improved 17.7% Improved 15.1% In the US, Fresh & Easy delivered another strong sales performance and we have reduced losses by nearly 18% year-on-year - the first full-year reduction in losses since our entry into the market.

Thirty stores are already making a positive contribution to cashflow, and 118 more are very close to doing so. We intend to focus on delivering this store-level profitability, before pushing on faster with expansion in the number of stores. As a result of this more measured approach to new capital expenditure, we now anticipate crossing into break-even in the US during 2013 14. Tesco Bank Tesco Bank results 2011 12 2011 12 Growth Tesco Bank revenue exc. impact of IFRIC 13 PS1,044m 13.6% Tesco Bank trading profit PS168m 36.4 % Tesco Bank trading margin 16.09% 1,264 bp Tesco Bank baseline profit PS203m 29.3% Tesco Bank increased its baseline profitability very strongly by 29%. This measures business growth, before key non-trading provisioning movements. This performance was particularly pleasing given the need to take a conservative approach on new savings and loans business during the final stages of systems migration. As we put more than three years of transition behind us, the Bank is well placed to deliver good growth, starting in the coming year. Trading profit was impacted by a number of factors. The unwind of the fair value provision, dating from the time of acquisition in 2008, reduced by PS133 million in the year, to PS22 million, and will be immaterial going forward. We increased our provision against possible claims arising from the sale of PPI by PS57 million in the first half of the year. With no further adjustments in the second half, we ended the year with a net provision of PS75 million. Our decision to slow down the final stages of migration also impacted profit by around PS40 million which will now begin to reverse. Bad debts reduced by 5.2% in the year due to the application of our robust credit policy. The Bank's overall capital position improved, from an already good position. Liquidity has also improved, with the retail bond issues giving us greater diversity in the Bank's funding position. Group balance sheet Net debt remained stable for the year at PS6.8 billion. This is a little behind our expectations at the half-year, due to the impact of the Christmas trading result on cash flow and to lower working capital inflow, linked to higher stock levels than planned. Group capital expenditure was slightly below our half-year expectation, at PS3.8 billion, due to tight control of spending. Operating cash flow from retail operations was down slightly year-on-year, at PS3.8 billion, again affected by lower working capital inflow. Our strategy to release value from our property portfolio has had another successful year, generating PS376 million of property profits from around PS1 billion of disposals. The launch of our first property fund in Asia completed successfully after the year end, raising over PS379 million from 17 mature stores and malls in Thailand. With the fund seeing strong demand on launch, and since trading above its listing price, this is a strong indication of the overall value of our operations in Thailand and elsewhere in Asia. The market value of our global property currently exceeds PS37 billion. Finally, our IAS 19, or accounting, pension deficit increased to PS1.4 billion after tax, largely as a consequence of market conditions. We announced proposed changes to the terms of our defined benefits scheme in March, in order to make it more sustainable over the long term. We also made a one-off cash contribution of PS180 million to the scheme after the year end, in anticipation of the forthcoming outcome of the triennial actuarial valuation, which we believe gives a more accurate indication of the likely costs of future funding of the scheme. Group financial metrics A year ago I set out four key financial metrics or measures to help investors monitor our capital returns performance, debt and overall balance sheet. Taking each in turn, we have improved return on capital employed 'ROCE' from 12.9% last year to 13.3%. This improvement benefits from Japan now being classified as discontinued as a result of our decision to exit the market. 10 11 12.9% 13.3% 11 12 13.3% 14.6% 14 15 TARGET T arget return on capital employed We held our two debt metrics, fixed charge cover and net indebtedness, broadly flat this year. Both measures will of course be directly affected by the UK investment plan we have announced for the coming year. Our target for fixed charge cover is between 4 and 4.5 times and, for net indebtedness, is 2.5 times. On our fourth key metric, capital expenditure as a proportion of sales, we were exactly in the middle of our target range of 5 to 5.5%. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 35 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Key performance indicators Financial review Looking forward Capital expenditure Our future plans include a reduced level of Group capital expenditure: down to PS3.3 billion in 2012 13 and, beyond that, comfortably less than 5% of sales. This reflects our movement into a new phase of growth for the Group, moving beyond the diversification and expansion phase, to a phase where the allocation of capital is based on the balance of growth and returns that each investment can deliver. Capital allocation Our plans lead to further significant changes in our capital allocation for the Group. Having already started some of this work in the UK, we are seeing higher returns on the new space that we have opened as a result. Across the Group more of our capital is going into smaller, higherreturning store formats. We will be investing less overall capital in our UK business, as we reduce the net new space opening programme by 38% in the coming year, and focus store openings on smaller stores, and on food more than non-food. Within the overall UK spend, we will be spending much more on the refresh of our existing stores, increasing our investment to over PS200 million, in addition to an increase in our online investment to around PS150 million. Capital work-in-progress The level of capital work-in-progress 'WIP' on the UK balance sheet now stands at around PS2 billion. Building out stores faster than we acquire new sites will be a key contributor to UK space growth over the next few years, and will reduce this level of WIP. The completion of mixed use schemes within the WIP balance will also play a significant role in bringing it down to a more appropriate level, although the construction phase on these schemes will add to the WIP balance in 2012 13, followed by a rapid reduction thereafter. In some instances, we may also dispose of standalone sites that do not meet our new, more rigorous returns hurdles. Cash This financial strategy means an increasingly cash generative outlook for Tesco in the next few years, with an overall reduction in Group capital expenditure, a return to growth in the cash contribution from the UK business, the international businesses making an increasingly positive contribution and a return to strong cash inflows from working capital. 08 09 PS708m PS611m PS66m 09 10 11 12 Cash inflows from decrease in retail working capital PS357m 10 11 average annual cash inflow from decrease in retail working capital 08 09 to 11 12 In line with our financial strategy, working capital management will result in a return to strong cash inflows from working capital in the coming years. Returns Capital restraint and improved cash generation both result in an improving ROCE. Last year, we laid out our commitment to improve ROCE to 14.6% by 2014 15. Our investment plans in the UK make it likely that we will see a small reduction in 2012 13. However, we described a number of significant opportunities to increase returns last year, such as driving growth in the Bank, benefiting from regional scale in Central Europe and moving the US to profitability, as well as the structural benefit of maturing international businesses. These opportunities still exist and indeed our decision to divest the Japanese business has already made a contribution. Our financial strategy of capital discipline and restraint supports a more sustainable level of growth, which focuses on getting more out of the businesses we currently have, benefits from less capital-intensive forms of investment and applies higher hurdle rates to new opportunities. This in turn drives higher returns and a higher level of cash generation. In supporting the plans that make Tesco better for customers, I believe this financial strategy is also better for shareholders.

The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group has an appropriate approach to risk management and internal control within the context of achieving the Group's objectives. Our process for identifying and managing risks is set out in more detail from page 60 of the Directors' report on corporate governance. The table below sets out the principal risks faced by the Group, their movement during the year and examples of relevant key controls and mitigating factors. The Board considers these to be the most significant risks and, whilst they are not directly comparable, they have been ranked in terms of relative importance to the Group at this time. They do not comprise all risks associated with the Group. Additional risks not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse effect on the business. The principal risks associated with operating Tesco Bank are considered separately in the section of the table below headed 'Tesco Bank Financial Services Risks'. Risk is an accepted part of doing business. The real challenge for any business is to identify the principal risks it faces and to develop and monitor appropriate controls.

Principal risks Change from 2010 11 Key controls and mitigating factors Transformation risk The Transformation Programme is a significant change programme designed to develop platforms and processes to enable the Bank to conduct banking and insurance business independently of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group 'RBS'. The key remaining component of the Transformation Programme is the migration of the credit card portfolio In addition, the Bank has well-developed plans for launching mortgages, subject to FSA approval There is strong programme governance in place with a tiered committee structure headed by the Bank's Executive-level Project Assessment Committee 'PAC' The Bank operates standard project management disciplines which are employed to deliver effective programme and risk and issue management Tesco Bank Financial Services Risks Tesco Bank 'the Bank' primarily operates in the UK retail financial services market offering savings products, unsecured consumer lending products and general insurance products as well as travel money and ATM services. The section below sets out principal risks relating specifically to the Bank. The Bank's Enterprise Wide Risk Management Framework identifies the main controls and actions. There are a number of key components of the framework common to all of the major risk categories, including the following: Component Description of the component Independent Risk function Reporting to the Chief Risk Officer 'CRO' and responsible for designing and implementing risk management frameworks and for independently monitoring the risk profile, providing oversight and challenge to the business Three lines of defence Line managers are responsible for establishing an effective control framework within their area of operations and for identifying and controlling all risks within risk appetite and policy limits first line of defence. The second line of defence is the independent Risk function. Internal Audit is the third line of defence and is responsible for the independent assessment of the effectiveness of the implementation of the overall risk and control measures Policy framework Risk is responsible for the policy framework, with the Bank's policy documents providing the rules and guiding principles that define the approach to specific subjects and covering all aspects of risk Integrated risk reporting Reporting is provided monthly to senior governance committees. Exposures are monitored against triggers and limits on a daily, weekly or monthly frequency as required. Exceptions are reported monthly to the Bank's Asset & Liability Management Committee 'ALCO', the Risk Management Committee 'RMC' and to each meeting of Board Risk Committee 'BRC' Stress testing Stress testing is the process under which the Bank's business plans, capital and liquidity are subjected to severe adverse impacts. Stress testing is a mandatory requirement of the FSA who require that banks implement their own stress testing processes. Stress testing is essential to effective risk management and is a key component of the Bank's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 'ICAAP' and Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment 'ILAA' processes 44 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 Principal risks Change from 2010 11 Key controls and mitigating factors Credit risk - external environment The downside risks to the UK economy remain high, including fragile consumer confidence, a squeezing of real incomes, increasing unemployment and some consumers increasing borrowing and switching to variable rate mortgages On the wider economic front subdued UK growth, continued fiscal austerity and the continuing eurozone debt crisis is impacting confidence and may impact the ability to sustain debt servicing and repayment in the event of an economic shock The Bank's credit risk appetite is based on lending responsibly to manage the credit risk profile of its portfolio within agreed parameters Credit portfolios continue to be closely monitored with changes made to acquisition and limit management strategies to mitigate, as far as possible, downside economic risks The Bank has minimal direct exposure to non-UK sovereigns and proactively monitors and manages the non-retail portfolios to reduce exposure to specific names or geographies Legal and regulatory compliance risk Legal and regulatory compliance risk is the risk of consequences arising as a result of non-compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the Bank's governance, prudential arrangements, business activities, risk management and its conduct with customers Conduct risk There remains significant regulatory focus in relation to 'Conduct risk' or 'Treating Customers Fairly'.

Regular reporting is provided to RMC and remedial actions taken as required The Procurement policy provides consistent and robust standards for supplier sourcing and selection The Bank's Strategic Relationship Management process enables the monitoring of the performance of third-party outsourcers and suppliers against agreed service level agreements, the management of the relationships and the improvement of supply or termination of contract where appropriate The Bank's People Matters Group, an Executive committee of the Bank, oversees key aspects of people risk, including talent management, performance management, retention and succession planning Market risk Market risk is defined as the risk that the value of the Bank's assets, liabilities, income or costs might vary due to changes in the value of financial market prices: this includes interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads and equities The Bank has no trading book There is low appetite for exposure to interest rate risk in the banking book 'IRRBB' and other market risks, such as credit spreads, which are monitored and reported through ALCO and RMC 46 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 Financial risks review The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and credit risks relating to the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions. The management of these risks is set out below. Details of the main financial risks relating to Tesco Bank and the management of those risks can be found in the principal risks and uncertainties table above and in Note 22 to the financial statements on page 126. Funding and liquidity The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, disposals of property assets, longand medium-term debt capital market issues, short-term commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases. The objective is to ensure continuity of funding. The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities and a strong credit rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. Tesco Group has a long-term rating of Astable from Fitch, Baa1 stable from Moody's and Astable from Standard & Poor's. New funding of PS2.5 billion was arranged during the year, including a net PS1.1 billion from property disposals and PS1.4 billion from long-term debt. At the year end, net debt was PS6.8 billion 2011: PS6.8 billion. Interest rate risk management Our objective is to limit our profit and loss downside from rising interest rates. Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and floors are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Our policy is to fix interest rates for the year on a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs of the Group excluding Tesco Bank. At the year end the percentage of interest bearing debt at fixed rates was 90% 2011: 71%. The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate form. The average rate of interest paid on an historic cost basis this year, excluding joint ventures and associates, was 4.8% 2011: 5.4%. Foreign currency risk management Our principal objective is to reduce the effect of exchange rate volatility on operating margins. Transactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are managed, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies and purchased currency options. At the year end, forward foreign currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to PS1,944 million were outstanding 2011: PS1,615 million as detailed in Note 21. We translate overseas profits at average foreign exchange rates which we do not currently further manage. We only hedge a proportion of the investment in our international subsidiaries as well as ensuring that each subsidiary is appropriately hedged in respect of its non-functional currency assets. During the year, currency movements decreased the net value, after the effects of hedging, of the Group's overseas assets by PS22 million last year decrease of PS344 million. Credit risk The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions across an approved list of counterparties of good credit quality. The Group's positions with these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored. Insurance We purchased assets, earnings and combined liability protection from the open insurance market for higher value losses only. The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the business with some cover being provided by our captive insurance companies, ELH Insurance Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the Republic of Ireland. ELH Insurance Limited covers Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability, while Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability only.

        "Detailed Analysis of ROE": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is ROE increasing or declining?**  \n  The **Return on Equity (ROE)** has sharply declined from **0.1579** in the previous year to **0.0075** in the current year, indicating a significant deterioration in the company's ability to generate profit from shareholders' equity.\n\n- **Is growth in ROE higher than that of competitors and the industry?**  \n  Based on the textual report and the drastic drop in ROE, Tesco's performance is likely weaker compared to competitors and industry benchmarks, especially given the challenges discussed such as the US exit, UK reinvestment, and economic headwinds in Europe. The report does not mention outperformance relative to peers in ROE, signaling underperformance.\n\n- **Is growth persistent or temporary?**  \n  The decline appears to be **temporary but significant**, driven by one-off charges including UK property write-downs (\u00a3804 million), goodwill impairments (\u00a3495 million), and increased PPI provisions (\u00a3115 million). The company is undergoing strategic restructuring and reinvestment to return to more sustainable growth and profitability, indicating potential for ROE recovery over time.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- Expected **ROE next year** is likely to improve moderately as the company focuses on **mid-single digit trading profit growth**, tighter **capital discipline** with capex in the range of 3.5% to 4% of sales, and strategic reinvestments in the UK core business and multichannel capabilities. However, the recovery will depend on successful execution of these plans and mitigating ongoing economic challenges.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- Tesco's **ROE declined sharply** from 15.8% to 0.75%, reflecting a substantial drop in profitability and efficiency in using equity capital.\n- The decline was driven by significant **one-off impairments and restructuring costs**, especially related to the US exit and UK property write-downs.\n- Despite the decline, Tesco is undertaking a **strategic reset focusing on UK reinvestment**, multichannel leadership, and disciplined international growth.\n- The company's **financial discipline initiatives** aim to reduce capital expenditure and improve free cash flow, which should support ROE improvement in the future.\n- Challenges remain from **regulatory impacts in South Korea, economic conditions in Europe, and competitive pressures**.\n- Tesco's **mid-single digit trading profit growth guidance** and ROCE target of 12-15% suggest management expects gradual profitability recovery.\n- The **dividend policy remains stable**, reflecting confidence in long-term sustainable returns despite short-term earnings pressure.\n- Tesco's strategy to shift away from large store expansion to **online and convenience formats** aligns with industry trends, potentially supporting future ROE growth.\n- The company faces risks of economic volatility and execution challenges but has a **strong management team and clear strategic priorities**.\n- Overall, Tesco's current low ROE is a red flag, but the firm is actively addressing structural issues to restore shareholder value.",
        "Detailed Analysis of ROE Drivers": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?**  \n  The company\u2019s **Asset Turnover** has slightly declined from **5.02** to **4.95**, indicating a marginal decrease in efficiency. More significantly, the **Profit Margin** fell sharply from **4.35%** to **0.19%**, reflecting a substantial decline in profitability. Therefore, the growth or stability in ROE is not supported by improvements in both measures; rather, it is negatively affected by a steep drop in profit margin while efficiency remains relatively stable. This is a **poor sign** for ROE drivers.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  The textual report highlights that Tesco faced a decline in underlying profit and margins due to investments in the UK business, regulatory impacts in South Korea, and economic challenges in Europe. This suggests that profit margins are under pressure relative to peers and industry norms. The slight decline in **Asset Turnover** also indicates that operational efficiency is not improving. Given the sharp margin contraction, it is likely that Tesco\u2019s margin is lower than industry leaders, although its asset efficiency remains relatively strong due to its scale and store footprint.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year:** Given the company\u2019s focus on investing in multichannel retailing and store refreshes, the **Asset Turnover** is expected to remain stable or slightly improve around **4.95 to 5.0** as operational efficiencies are optimized.  \n- **Expected Profit Margin next year:** With continued investment and operational challenges, profit margin is likely to recover modestly but remain subdued, forecasted around **0.5% to 1.5%**, as the company balances reinvestment with cost control.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- Tesco\u2019s **ROE drivers** are currently strained, with a **sharp decline in Profit Margin** overshadowing a relatively stable but slightly decreasing **Asset Turnover**.  \n- The company\u2019s operational efficiency remains solid given its scale, but profitability pressures from reinvestment and market conditions have significantly eroded margins.  \n- **Forecasts** suggest a cautious recovery in profit margins as strategic initiatives take effect, while asset efficiency is expected to stabilize, indicating a gradual improvement in overall ROE drivers.",
        "Detailed Analysis of Risk": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Are risks increasing or declining?**  \n  The company's **NLP financial risk (0.67)**, **legal risk (0.2)**, and **tax risk (0.69)** have all declined compared to the previous year (**1.33, 0.57, and 0.99** respectively), indicating a **decline in overall risk levels**.\n\n- **Is the number and severity of risks higher than competitors/industry?**  \n  The provided data does not include direct competitor or industry benchmarks for risks, but the significant decline in NLP risk indicators suggests **improved risk management relative to earlier periods**.\n\n- **Is sentiment increasing or declining?**  \n  While sentiment measures are not explicitly provided, the **decline in NLP risk values** and the Chairman's and CEO's statements about decisive actions, restructuring, and disciplined capital allocation imply an **improving tone and positive sentiment** toward managing risks.\n\n- **Is specificity increasing or declining?**  \n  **NLP specificity decreased slightly from 0.0790 to 0.0739**, suggesting a marginal decline in the level of specific risk disclosures; however, the textual report contains detailed discussions on risk management and strategic decisions.\n\n- **Are complexity measures increasing or declining?**  \n  **NLP sentence length decreased from 30.58 to 27.08 words**, and **sentence depth slightly increased from 6.56 to 6.58**, indicating a **mild decline in complexity by sentence length but a negligible increase in syntactic complexity**.\n\n- **How are sentiment, specificity, and complexity compared to competitors?**  \n  Without competitor data, a precise comparison is unavailable. However, the detailed and transparent narrative in the report along with reduced risk indicators implies the company is likely performing **better or on par with industry peers in risk disclosure and sentiment**.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Is Gearing expected to increase next year?**  \n  Given the **increase in gearing from 1.64 to 1.75**, but with management's emphasis on maintaining a **strong investment grade credit rating** and improving debt metrics, **gearing may stabilize or slightly decrease rather than increase**.\n\n- **Is Current Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The **current ratio improved slightly from 0.668 to 0.69**, and with focus on working capital management, it is reasonable to expect a **modest increase in the current ratio next year**.\n\n- **Is Quick Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The **quick ratio declined from 0.186 to 0.163**, reflecting tighter liquidity on a quick asset basis. Management's cash flow focus could improve this, so a **slight recovery or stabilization in quick ratio is forecasted**.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- **Overall risk indicators (financial, legal, tax) have declined significantly, signaling improved risk management and reduced exposure.**  \n- **Sentiment inferred from the report and risk metrics suggests a more positive, proactive stance on risk and financial discipline.**  \n- **Specificity in risk disclosures showed a slight decline but remains supported by detailed narrative, while complexity measures indicate slightly simpler language use.**  \n- **Financial ratios show a slight increase in gearing but with management committed to creditworthiness, and liquidity ratios (current and quick) show marginal changes with prospects for stabilization or modest improvement.**  \n- **The company is focused on capital discipline, risk reduction, and sustainable growth as detailed in the report, enhancing transparency and investor confidence.**",
        "summary": "- Tesco\u2019s **Return on Equity (ROE) sharply declined from 15.8% to 0.75%**, reflecting a significant drop in profitability primarily due to one-off impairments and restructuring costs.  \n- The steep decline in **Profit Margin (from 4.35% to 0.19%)** has been the main driver of the ROE deterioration, while **Asset Turnover** remained relatively stable around 4.95, indicating operational efficiency was maintained.  \n- Despite current challenges, Tesco\u2019s **strategic reset focusing on UK reinvestment, multichannel growth, and capital discipline** is a key strength aimed at restoring profitability and shareholder value.  \n- Risk indicators such as **financial, legal, and tax risks have decreased substantially**, signaling improved risk management and enhanced transparency.  \n- Liquidity ratios show mixed trends: **Current Ratio improved slightly to 0.69**, while **Quick Ratio declined to 0.163**, suggesting tight but manageable short-term liquidity.  \n- **Gearing increased modestly to 1.75**, but management\u2019s commitment to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating implies gearing is expected to stabilize or improve.  \n- The company faces ongoing economic and regulatory headwinds, particularly in Europe and South Korea, which remain key concerns for profitability recovery.  \n- Tesco\u2019s **mid-single digit trading profit growth guidance and ROCE target of 12-15%** indicate management\u2019s confidence in a gradual but sustainable financial turnaround.  \n- The shift away from large store expansion towards **online and convenience formats aligns well with industry trends**, supporting future margin and ROE improvements.  \n- Overall, Tesco currently exhibits **low ROE and margin pressures**, but improved risk profiles, clear strategic priorities, and disciplined capital management provide a strong foundation for recovery."

It has been a year of addressing longstanding business issues: bedding in management and governance change: and laying the foundations for sustainable future growth. In all these areas I believe the Company has responded with energy, skill and application and we have made progress. Business issues One of the greatest challenges for a business is to face itself honestly. It is also the mark of a quality business that it can do so, since the capacity to name issues is the essential first step towards addressing them. The decisions to seek a sale of the US business and to call an end to the UK space race in large stores reflect this. As with the decision last year to reinvest in our UK business, they reflected a long, hard look at where the business needs to devote its energy and resources to create sustainable value: and a willingness to face up to tough decisions to do this. Some of these decisions had painful short-term consequences. The early signs are that the decision to reinvest in the UK is strengthening the business and we believe the steps we have taken in the US and in respect to UK property will similarly underpin a sustainable, profitable future, notwithstanding the accounting write-downs we have had to take this year as a consequence. Bedding in management and governance change The year has also seen a generational transition in management. This is not a surprise when there has been a relatively unchanged management team in place for a substantial time and we are fortunate in Tesco to have a substantial depth of talent to draw on from around the world. It is striking how many of the executives taking on new and enhanced responsibilities bring international as well as extensive UK experience to their roles, reflecting the breadth of Tesco's business. A largely new Executive Committee has been developed under Philip Clarke's leadership. Many talented, and widely experienced, younger executives are getting to grips with new responsibilities with skill and enthusiasm. Similarly in the UK business, a substantially new leadership team with a wide diversity of experience and skills is in place under a new Managing Director. \" It has been a year of addressing long-standing business issues: bedding in management and governance change: and laying the foundations for sustainable future growth. In all these areas I believe the Company has responded with energy, skill and application and we have made progress. \" Sir Richard Broadbent Chairman Visit www. com ar2013 to hear more from Sir Richard Broadbent and other members of the leadership team. 3 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Report from the Chief Executive I am pleased to have this opportunity to report on the past year, during which we have taken some significant business decisions and laid down some important building blocks for the future. I will share my perceptions of the year under the following headings: The wider context - adapting to lead the digital future The business in 2012 13 - a year of transition Setting financial disciplines for the future Driving future growth and returns Culture Management The wider context - adapting to lead the digital future It has been clear for some time that we are seeing a seismic shift in our industry and its pace is accelerating. In 2012 global e-commerce activity reached $1 trillion. I'five worked in retailing for nearly 40 years but never in that time has there been a period of such profound and rapid change as I see today. The digital age is transforming not just the way people shop, but also the way they live their lives. The opportunities this is creating are exciting. It provides the potential for Tesco to make customers' lives easier: to enable them to shop in whichever way suits them best: and it enables us to offer them new products and services. This plays to our strengths. Since Tesco was founded, we have always been pioneers and innovators in retailing. Our central focus, our culture, is and has been to lead in understanding and delivering what customers want, in the way they want it, at the time they want it. Uniquely among our peers, we have a profitable dotcom grocery business. From drivethrough Grocery Click & Collect in the UK to our virtual shopping walls on the subway in South Korea, we are introducing exciting innovations to improve the customer shopping trip. Thanks to Clubcard and dunnhumby we have unique insights into how our customers' behaviour is changing. Our new conversation with customers - through a variety of channels - is about listening to what they want, to how they're living their lives today, and then adapting and building the business accordingly: as we have said for years, 'Every Little Helps'. \" The digital age is transforming not just the way people shop, but also the way they live their lives. \" Philip Clarke Chief Executive Visit www. com ar2013 to hear more from Philip Clarke and other members of the leadership team. 4 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Report from the Chief Executive continued So we are exceptionally well-placed to thrive in this new era of retailing. However, to grasp the opportunity we must adapt because it will require a different type of business, with a different type of relationship with our customers, and a new set of capabilities. We have already begun this process of adaptation. A year ago, I signalled the end of the space race and a change in focus. I indicated that our future investment would be less about new large stores, and that it would be more focused on multichannel retailing and on smaller formats. A year on, I am even more certain that this is the right approach for us to take. The future of retailing is multichannel because, in this increasingly complex and volatile world, consumers are looking for simplicity and for brands they can trust. A truly multichannel business - one which offers customers the ability to shop anywhere, anyhow and any time - will be more likely to become a winner in the new era than one which concentrates purely on one channel or another. Our stores are a vital part of this multichannel vision. Tesco has a superb portfolio of welllocated stores in all of our markets, but adapting to a digital future means harnessing this great asset to the changing requirements of the digital age. This will require rethinking how we use the space in our stores, how we offer and deliver what we sell, how we interface with our customers and much else besides. I will return to the specifics of what we are doing in some of these areas below. The business in 2012 13 - a year of transition This year's performance was principally the result of three things in combination: the decision we took in early 2012 to reset our margin in the UK and invest PS1 billion in improving our offer for customers: the continuing economic challenges our customers around the world are facing, particularly in and around the Eurozone: and the impact of legislation restricting opening hours in South Korea, our largest market outside the UK. I have reflected on the work we have done over the first two years of my tenure as CEO and it is clear to me that much of our effort has been about removing barriers to progress. The business has delivered many years of growth and good returns, but was in danger of being inhibited from further sustainable progress by an attachment to initiatives and strategies which, while they served us well in the past, need to be adapted to deliver growth in a more economically challenged and rapidly changing world. Consequently we have had to tackle a number of issues which needed to be addressed before we could move the business forward. This work has entailed some tough and at times painful decisions and while it is not finished, I am confident we have already tackled the biggest issues. These changes were often difficult to face up to, complex to implement and they have required a great deal of hard work by many people, some of whom have been directly affected by the decisions. By way of reminder, in a little over 18 months we have: 1. Decided to exit markets in which we saw no prospect of acceptable investment returns in an appropriate time frame - Japan and the United States: 2. Devised and progressed the comprehensive PS1 billion investment plan to 'Build a Better Tesco' in the UK, resetting our margins to fund the scale and pace of change required: 3. Put an end to the big store space race - placing a much greater emphasis on growth through both digital and convenience retailing, wherever we operate: 4. Reviewed our entire UK property pipeline to ensure it is appropriate for our future needs and valued accordingly. Going forward this will mean less capital commitment to property development and also less asset divestment: 5. Reflected the new global economic reality by reviewing and moderating the rate of expansion in some large economies such as China and sharply reduced spending in some of our European markets: and 6. Focused Tesco Bank on the smooth migration of customer accounts to our platforms, strong governance, risk management and increasingly on preparing it for its key role in our multichannel future. \" A truly multichannel business - one which offers customers the ability to shop anywhere, anyhow and any time - will be more likely to become a winner in the new era than one which concentrates purely on one channel or another. \" 5 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS These decisive actions are necessary in order to ensure sustainable longer-term growth. I am acutely aware that withdrawing from the US and writing down the value of property developments no longer appropriate for the future have had a significant impact. It is time to act and I believe this work has cleared the way for the business now to move forward. Having tackled these issues, Tesco is a more focused business, which can apply all of its considerable resources and energies to meeting the challenges and grasping the opportunities created by the changes taking place in our industry today. These actions may have been the most visible, and therefore the most tangible, signs of change to the outside world but within Tesco we'five been making other important changes to prepare the business for the future - putting it on track for sustainable growth and returns. Setting financial disciplines for the future Not only have we started on the journey of transforming our business to enable it to move forward as a leader in the new digital world, we are also fundamentally changing the financial profile of the Group. The Tesco of the future will pursue more focused growth, consume less capital and generate more free cash flow. Making this transformation in all its aspects will of course not be without its challenges - and the clearest evidence of this can be seen in the first reduction in profits of the Group for two decades, which we reported on in April. Everything we are doing reflects my determination to deliver shareholder value, an appropriate balance between investing for future growth, and delivering sustainable returns for our shareholders. I want to be very clear: if there is one lesson to be learned from the past it is the importance of capital discipline and this marks the start of a new era of capital discipline in Tesco. We are confident we can deliver attractive and sustainable returns within a framework where capital expenditure falls to around 3.5% to 4% of sales. For our investors, this means they can expect mid-single digit trading profit growth and return on capital employed within a range of 12% to 15%. The fundamental change in our approach to new space I described earlier also has implications for our sale and leaseback programme. Two years ago, we reviewed the programme and announced a steady reduction in the level of divestments, in order to ensure that any property profits released were matched to the level of new profit created by development activities. Given that we have significantly reduced the amount of these activities going forward, we believe that it is appropriate to accelerate the scaling back of the sale and leaseback programme, such that it is unlikely to make a material contribution after the next few years. The outcomes which we have laid out for investors will be achieved through disciplined investment, focused on those existing markets where we see the best opportunity for significant growth and returns. Driving future growth and returns For me as your CEO, driving sustainable growth within this new financial framework is about three priorities. These are not new areas for us but they each have the capacity to be the engines of growth for the Group for years to come: i Continue to strengthen the UK business ii Drive sustainable growth through multichannel leadership iii Pursue disciplined international growth Whilst the past year has not been without some significant challenges, we have made progress on these priorities: \" Everything we are doing reflects my determination to deliver shareholder value, an appropriate balance between investing for future growth, and delivering sustainable returns for our shareholders. \" 6 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Report from the Chief Executive continued i Continue to strengthen the UK business A year ago we announced a plan to 'Build a Better Tesco' in the UK. In last year's Annual Report I described how getting our business at home back to leading was the single most important objective for Tesco. Having grasped the nettle and decided to reinvest in the UK business in early 2012, we have seen a pleasing response from customers - and consequently the performance of the business is now markedly better. The 'Building a Better Tesco' plan is firmly on track. I am proud of the work our teams have done to improve the look and feel of certain stores, to develop new products and to reformulate existing product ranges, whilst delivering better service and availability for customers. We want to be the best value, most convenient and integrated, most relevant and personalised retailer and we are making good progress. We invested PS200 million to have the equivalent of 8,000 more colleagues in-store and also provided customer service and specialist training for nearly 250,000 team members to help them serve customers better. Consequently, our customer ratings of service and staff helpfulness have improved and customer complaint numbers have fallen sharply. We have made a good start and there will be more progress in 2013. We refreshed 300 stores, representing almost a quarter of our space, delivering a warmer look and feel and better standards of presentation in our fresh food departments. Our price image with customers has also improved, and we have supplemented our work on pricing with stronger, personalised Clubcard mailings and, more recently, the introduction of our Tesco Price Promise, which aims to reassure customers that they will never be disadvantaged on price when they shop with us. On ranging, the strong performance of the relaunched Everyday Value range has continued and we have put significant investment into improving 3,500 core Tesco own-label lines, with an emphasis on fresh food categories. We have made fundamental changes to the way we communicate with our customers, with the most prominent early change being the appointment of a new lead advertising agency, Wieden Kennedy. Our first new advertising campaign, which began last Christmas, was very well received by customers. Our store strategy is 'Food First' which means a more targeted, less space-intensive approach to general merchandise in-store, with Tesco Direct becoming better equipped to offer customers the much greater breadth and depth of range that the online platform provides so well. It also means other changes to our stores - such as clothing becoming more prominent and services taking more space. This means, for example, allocating more space to Click & Collect so that we are giving customers the compelling convenience of being able to order what they want online and pick up in-store. Upgrading our in-store dining offer will also utilise more of our existing space. We aim to give customers shopping in our stores the kind of food experience they have when they visit shopping malls or high streets. We'll do this through the investments we have made in new family-friendly restaurants, coffee shops and artisan bakeries - such as Giraffe, Harris Hoole and Euphorium. They will be increasingly available around our network of larger stores in the UK. I'five been particularly encouraged to see that the innovative spirit, that desire to be first for customers which made Tesco what it is, has also flourished in this period of rapid change. A good example of this is in our dotcom grocery business where the roll-out of our drivethrough Click & Collect modules in 150 of our car parks helped our online sales grow 12.8% - which was faster than the market, in which we already have a high share. The launch of our Delivery Saver subscription service in May 2012 also contributed to our outperformance. \" Having grasped the nettle and decided to reinvest in the UK business in early 201 2, we have seen a pleasing response from customers - and consequently the performance of the business is now markedly better. \" 7 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our UK business is more competitive, performance relative to the market has improved and our margins have stabilised, as planned, and there is still much more to come. The scope for further improvement means that this objective remains our most important priority. I am pleased with the progress we'five made, but I am equally pleased that we have the opportunity and plans for that progress to continue. With the new UK management team now bedded in, in January this year I felt able to step back from the day-to-day running of the business, which I had assumed temporarily in March 2012. Chris Bush, who has over 30 years' experience in Tesco, has taken over the leadership as UK Managing Director. The strategic importance of Tesco Bank to the Group is being increased by the impact of the internet on the way our customers shop - and I believe it is a key part of our multichannel future. It will provide the means for more and more of our customers to transact online using Tesco financial products. Several years of infrastructure build and the wider challenges that the whole banking sector has had to deal with - from more careful management of risk to PPI claims - have held back performance. The Bank plays an important role in driving increased loyalty for Tesco and we are giving even more focus to delivering the best possible products and prices to our Clubcard customers. ii Drive sustainable growth through multichannel leadership I believe establishing multichannel leadership - combining digital and online seamlessly with our existing excellent physical store network - is going to be critical for our future success. We'five made good progress - we're the largest internet retailer of food in the UK and we're getting bigger and better in clothing and general merchandise - but the opportunities remain huge. The judgements we make today about how we respond to the new digital era will profoundly affect the kind of business Tesco becomes in the years ahead. The internet and social media are rapidly changing the way people live their lives: the way they shop and what they expect from us - not just in terms of goods and services, but also what we stand for and how we contribute to society. The speed of that change is accelerating and if we are to lead this revolution in our industry, I believe we must move faster and embrace it. Calling an end to the big store space race and beginning a move to refocus our investment away from large stores, particularly hypermarkets, to convenience and online has been followed by an accelerating pace of change over recent months in all our businesses and geographies. For example, we are increasing our investment in technology and PS500 million of our total capital spend will be devoted to technology, enabling us to create a seamless blend between our stores and online businesses. A good example of this change in emphasis is blinkbox. We are already one of the leading retailers of films, TV series, music and books in the UK. Given the rapid pace of change in the way customers are buying entertainment products, we have been working to develop a range of new digital services. In March 2013 we launched Clubcard TV using the blinkbox platform, a free service providing family-friendly films and television series to our most loyal customers. In the next few months, we will be launching blinkboxmusic and blinkboxbooks, demonstrating our commitment to providing the very best entertainment as easily as possible for our customers. Going forward, we will be applying this thinking and experience to our international markets around the world. \" Given the rapid pace of change in the way customers are buying entertainment products, we have been working to develop a range of new digital services. \" \" The strategic importance of Tesco Bank to the Group is being increased by the impact of the internet on the way our customers shop - and I believe it is a key part of our multichannel future. \" 8 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Report from the Chief Executive continued iii Pursue disciplined international growth The single most important step we took in 2012 13 in our international business was to launch a strategic review of Fresh & Easy in the United States and in April we confirmed our decision to exit the market. This was not a decision lightly reached but in keeping with what I have said about the need to move the business forward, and to do so in a disciplined way - the US business simply did not offer the prospect of acceptable returns in an appropriate time frame. Whilst the process of exit is ongoing, and as such the full financial effect of it is yet to be fully determined, we have written down the assets of the business and booked provisions for future liabilities - which together have impacted profit after tax by PS 1 billion. Fundamentally, we invest overseas because we have the opportunity to generate returns by using our skill and scale in high-growth economies, where retailing is less mature, to build substantial market positions and strong consumer franchises. This opportunity is unchanged and exploiting it remains an important element of our strategy. We have had success - 32% of our sales and 29% of our profit now comes from outside the UK, and we have market-leading businesses in eight of our 11 international markets. Over two decades of international development we have learned a huge amount about what works and what doesn't - getting the pace and scale of expansion right for local conditions, getting the balance right between local front-end, global skills in sourcing and logistics and being ready to partner where appropriate. Utilising this knowledge is critical to driving future returns from our international business. Looking forward, these lessons will guide our approach to internationalisation. We will stay focused for the foreseeable future on our existing markets, and on allocating significant capital only where we see very good prospects of strong investment returns. And where we do invest, it will be with a clear emphasis on lower capital intensity routes to growth such as convenience and online. I have categorised our countries into three groups to explain what this approach means in practice: In Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia, where we have strong market positions and economic growth remains more robust, our businesses have substantial further potential for growth. These markets continued to deliver excellent performance in 2012 13, although the headline growth was obscured by the c. PS 100 million profit impact of legislation to restrict large store shopping hours in South Korea. Looking forward, the opportunities to build on our already strong positions in these fast-growing economies remain compelling and are therefore our highest international priority. In the European markets where we have solid, in some cases, market-leading businesses, but where the economic backdrop has been damaging to performance, our emphasis will be on holding our position, driving further benefits of skill and scale and making targeted investment in specific opportunities, such as online and convenience retailing. At present, the economic context remains unfavourable with continued recession and austerity in all of our markets - the Republic of Ireland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Long term, these remain fundamentally attractive markets for Tesco both as growth markets and as markets where multichannel retailing is still in its infancy. In China, Turkey and India, which are exciting long-term growth opportunities, we will push on - but carefully - adopting a steadier pace of growth that is, importantly, more cautious about capital allocation. Our model in India is to work with the Tata Group, and we are unable to commit our own capital under current regulations. However, the model works, we like our partner and we are learning a lot about the market. We will commit new capital to China and Turkey, but only for those opportunities that pass our rigorous investment appraisal targets. We will be committing less capital in the coming years than we have done in the past - at least until we can demonstrate a significant step forward towards our objective of stronger returns. \" We will stay focused for the foreseeable future on our existing markets, and on allocating significant capital only where we see very good prospects of strong investment returns. \" 9 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Capitalising on the multichannel opportunity in all these markets will be a core part of our longterm planning. We are already moving much faster to roll out grocery home shopping - which is now in eight international markets and we plan to launch in China later this financial year. Culture For a consumer business above all, what you represent is critical and it is right that we should be responsive and open about our Values and what we stand for. We should actively manage them just as we manage other parts of our business. We have completed a thorough review, looking at whether our Core Purpose and Values are all that we need in this new world and at a time of change. We have concluded that we need to encourage some changes to ensure it is clear to everyone at Tesco and beyond that we will put more back into society than we take out. You will find a lot more about this over the page and in the Tesco and Society Report. Today, our brand must be about more than simply function. It's about the way we work, the values we live by, the legacy we leave. We can't solve the world's problems but we want Tesco to always do the right thing, to inspire and to earn trust and loyalty from all our stakeholders. And we are putting some clear ambition into changing things for the better in areas where we can make a difference because of who and what we are: First, we are going to focus our attention on young people wherever we are in the world. We are a major global employer, which means we understand how to provide opportunities for people in their working lives. So we want to use that to help millions of young people who are worried about their future and are uncertain how to get a foothold in the world of work. Second, we're going to help and encourage our colleagues and customers to live healthier lives and through this help to tackle the global obesity crisis. Third, we're going to lead on the challenge of reducing food waste globally. 'Waste not, want not' is at the heart of 'Every Little Helps'. So it is natural for us to want to take a leading role in preventing the enormous quantities of food going to waste every day around the world. I believe that by applying our skills and resources - our scale - to these areas, Tesco can make a difference and make things better. Management I am delighted to say that underpinning all of our drivers of growth - UK, multichannel and international - is the strength of the new management team we have created. Our new Executive Committee draws on the potential of the strongest, most experienced leaders within Tesco, complemented by some first-class external appointments in key disciplines. I am confident that the team we now have in place has the skills, experience, creativity and drive to deliver our ambitions. All of these changes are the result of my determination to ensure that Tesco is a company that delivers shareholder value - but one that does so by delivering what matters to all our stakeholders. Philip Clarke Chief Executive \" Today, our brand must be about more than simply function. It's about the way we work, the values we live by, the legacy we leave. \" 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Core Purpose and Values Our Core Purpose is a clear and simple statement of what we do and what we stand for: We make what matters better, together Our Core Purpose is a clear and simple statement of what we do and what we stand for. It has been the same for many years but the time has come to update it. Our Core Purpose needs to reflect how much society has changed in recent years - more scepticism about corporations, more desire to see business demonstrate it has a purpose beyond profit, a sense that large companies should be contributing more to tackling some of the big challenges. The world has changed from a culture of 'more is better' to 'making what matters better'. That's why we'five changed our Core Purpose - this profound shift in society must be reflected in the way we think and behave as a business. Today, our brand must be about more than simply function. It's about the way we work, the values we live by, the legacy we leave. We can't solve the world's problems but we want Tesco to always do the right thing, to inspire and to earn trust and loyalty from all of our stakeholders. 11 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our new Core Purpose is: We make what matters better, together. It is true to where we came from but more relevant to today and to the kind of company we want to be. Since we first introduced our Tesco Values more than a decade ago, they have become a vital part of our culture - and an essential underpinning of our growth and success. They ensure that every person at Tesco understands what is important - about how we work together as a team and how customers are at the centre of what we do. They are universal values, which have helped guide our people as Tesco has grown into new markets and new countries. And as with our Core Purpose, we have had a hard look at whether the Values are all that we need in this new world and at a time of change - and we'five concluded that we need a new Value, one that makes it clear to everyone at Tesco and beyond that we will put more back into society. Our new Value is: We use our scale for good. Tesco is now a large company, touching millions of people's lives every day. This scale gives us an opportunity to make a positive difference to some of the biggest challenges facing the world. We'five set three big ambitions in areas where we can make a real contribution and create value for society as a whole. Our new Value is also about building on the essential work we already do as a responsible corporate citizen. Our Values help us to understand how to put this into practice: 1 No one tries harder for customers 2 We treat everyone how we like to be treated 3 We use our scale for good Understand customers Be first to meet their needs Act responsibly for our communities Understanding people - customers, colleagues, communities - and what matters to them, and then trying to make those things better, is at the heart of Tesco. It's about listening to people and talking to them using all the tools at our disposal - from Clubcard data to social media - and then acting by changing and innovating to meet their needs. Work as a team Trust and respect each other Listen, support and say thank you Share knowledge and experience We know that looking after our colleagues in a culture of trust and respect is essential to the success of Tesco. Where colleagues feel recognised and rewarded for the work they do together, where they have the opportunity to get on and where they are supported in their development as they move through their careers in the business - they in turn try their hardest for customers. Creating new opportunities for millions of young people around the world Helping and encouraging our colleagues and customers to live healthier lives and through this helping to tackle the global obesity crisis Leading in reducing food waste globally Our scale means that we can provide affordable, high-quality food to people around the world and create value for customers. We want to use this scale to create greater value for society as a whole. In many ways we do this already, whether it's by creating thousands of jobs or working with thousands of farmers to provide world-class products. But now we want to scale up our efforts and make a positive contribution to some of the most pressing challenges facing the world. 12 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Vision and Strategy Our Vision sets out what we want to be: In any business, clear direction is vital. Our Vision guides the direction and the decisions we take as an organisation. Tesco is a company built around customers and colleagues, highquality assets around the world and multiple opportunities for growth - and these characteristics are central to our Vision for the business. We want Tesco to be the most highly valued business by: the customers we serve, the communities in which we operate, our loyal and committed colleagues and of course, our shareholders. For these things to be possible, our Vision for the business has five elements - each of them describes the sort of company Tesco aspires to be. Wanted and needed around the world We see it as essential not only to be the shop of choice for customers but also the place people want to work, a business that communities welcome and the retailer in which every shareholder wants to invest. A growing business, full of opportunities Whether it's food or general merchandise, books or digital entertainment, banking or eating out, our business is full of opportunities for both customers and colleagues. We want our business to offer something new every time. Modern, innovative and full of ideas Tesco's success has always been based on trying to understand customers' needs better than anyone else - and then innovating to make their lives that little bit easier. This attitude, which brought online grocery shopping, extended shopping hours, Finest, Everyday Value, a range of formats from Express to Extra - and all the other things that make us who we are - is as central to our Vision now as it ever has been. Winners locally whilst applying our skills globally Retail is local because cultures, tastes, climates, regulations are all different. But the core skills that we have learned in one place can be applied in others. For example, setting up our grocery home shopping operations from scratch in eight international markets across the Group wouldn't have been possible without what we'five learned in the UK. Inspiring, earning trust and loyalty from customers, our colleagues and communities We want Tesco to be a company that earns trust, not just respect, through everything we do - be it our in-store shopping trip, our Price Promise, or our determination to assure customers on food quality. We want to be a business that customers, colleagues and communities trust and are loyal to. 13 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our Strategy reflects our priorities as the business grows and customers' needs change: We have a well-established and consistent seven-part strategy for growth, which reflects the way consumer needs are changing and the increasingly global nature of our business - and of course driving it forward is critical to our success over the coming years. To grow the UK core T o grow the UK core, the largest business in the Group and a key driver of sales and profit, is a priority. Our 'Building a Better T esco' plan has been restoring growth to the business through a comprehensive series of improvements for customers. To be an outstanding international retailer in stores and online We have established profitable businesses in Asian and European markets. T oday, 32% of our Group sales and 29% of profits are made internationally and our goal now is to take the performance of these businesses to higher levels. To be as strong in everything we sell as we are in food Food is our heritage but as the business has grown and diversified over recent years, we have added an ever-wider range of products and services in-store and online, bringing T esco value and quality to many more categories. To grow retail services in all our markets Consumers are increasingly spending a bigger proportion of their income on services - whether it is in telecoms, eating out or financial services. In the UK, we have built some strong, successful new businesses and our ambition now is to take that experience to all of our markets. T o put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do The changes we have made to our Core Purpose and Values to reflect T esco's wider social purpose are clear signals that we put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do. To be a creator of highly valued brands Brands are about giving customers confidence in the quality, value and reliability of the things we sell. We aim to be a creator of highly valued brands across our offer, whether it is Finest, F&F or T esco Bank. To build our team so that we create more value As T esco continues to grow and diversify we need more leaders to run the broad range of businesses, operations and support functions. We are investing in the development of more leaders and a bigger, more diverse talent pool to support the growth of the Group. 14 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Building the T esco brand Leveraging Group Developing our people Creating valuable property Operating responsibly Innovating our offer Develop economies of scale Invest in our offer for customers Sell more skill and scale Insight Buy Sell Move Core Purpose: We make what matters better, together Business Model Our Business Model is how we put our Strategy into action: 15 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our core activities Like all retailers, we buy, move and sell products and services for our customers. They rely on us to do these things consistently well and we strive to do them better, more simply and more efficiently each time. We have convenient, well-invested store and distribution networks, with a skilled and experienced team and modern systems designed to help us do this reliably - as well as growing capability and scale online. This operational effectiveness is at the core of the Tesco business model. Winning loyalty is also about looking constantly at ways to do things differently and innovating for customers so that our offer doesn't stand still. Innovation comes from insight and insight starts with listening. We try to work out what matters to customers by talking to them - and the conversation goes on all the time, in all our businesses, in stores and online, whether it is through our regular customer question time sessions or social media feedback. Customers tell us what's important to them - when we're doing well and, even more importantly, when we're not. Coupling that feedback with the data we get from Clubcard and the analysis we apply from dunnhumby - and then acting on the result - is what Tesco is all about. The virtuous circle Striving for continuous improvement in operations and in the shopping trip, as well as staying close to customers, are fundamentals but the engine of the Tesco business model has always been a combination of scale and growth. This remains just as true today in an environment where growth across many markets is harder to come by. Tesco may only be as successful as a customer's last shopping trip but our scale and how we use it are very important to how we create value. Buying well and selling efficiently are essential in order to be competitive for customers. When we combine these really well, we deliver a great offer and customers reward us with more of their business. The more we sell, the more we are able to work with our suppliers to achieve mutually beneficial economies of scale, which in turn creates room to invest more for customers - in products, categories and businesses. This has served the business well over many decades - but in our business in the UK we stepped off the virtuous circle when the recession hit. We didn't put enough back in for customers at a time when they were under pressure - and our performance and reputation felt the effect. We recognised the need to change, and last year we chose to reduce and reset our own margin to fund substantial investment in improving the shopping trip for customers and to move the business towards stronger growth. The key enablers The core elements of the business model have six key enablers - including, for example, leveraging Group skill and scale and innovating our offer - which maximise the potential of the core activities and ensure that what we do is sustainable. Transferring know-how, new systems and processes around the Group has become a regular part of how we do things based on the principle of 'invent once, deploy everywhere'. As our leadership group - which numbers over 500 directors - gains even more experience in multiple markets, new technologies and approaches can be introduced quickly and cost-effectively. Loyalty and own-label programmes, format expertise and online trading platforms are all current examples of Tesco leveraging Group skill and scale. As keeping pace with changing consumer shopping patterns - what they buy, how, where and when they shop - becomes ever more demanding, staying close to our customers means that we are well-placed to see and to grasp the opportunities to innovate. For example, we spend a lot of time applying new technology in-store so that we can improve the shopping experience for customers. A good example is Scan as you Shop - now in 100 stores - which allows customers to scan products as they put them into the trolley, see how much they are spending as they go, and reduce their waiting time at the checkouts. 16 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Key performance indicators Group performance Growth in underlying profit before tax 14.5 % Return on capital employed 'ROCE' 12.7% Growth in underlying diluted earnings per share at a constant tax rate 14.0 % 09 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 8.7% 12.3% 2.1% 14.5 % Definition Our underlying profit provides information on the underlying trend and performance of the business. It is adjusted for a number of non-cash accounting adjustments and one-off costs. Performance Our year-on-year performance in underlying profit before tax reflects a number of factors - mainly our planned investment into the UK business, the regulatory changes in South Korea and the impact of challenging economic conditions in Europe. The 2011 12 figure including the US was 1.6%. 11 12 12 13 14.7% 12.7% 09 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 7.7% 10.8% 2.6% 14.0 % Definition Underlying diluted earnings per share 'EPS' is the amount of underlying profit, adjusted for the number of shares in issue. Performance The fall in underlying diluted EPS reflects the reduction of earnings this year. We have maintained the proposed full year dividend per share despite this, demonstrating our confidence that the steps we have taken in 2012 13 will set the Group on track to resume growth. The 2011 12 figure including the US was 2.1%. Definition ROCE is a relative profit measurement that demonstrates the return the business is generating from its gross assets. Performance ROCE decreased during the year, reflecting our trading profit performance. The 2011 12 figure including the US was 13.3%. Group financial ratios Total shareholder return 'TSR' Net indebtedness 1 2 3 4 12 13 11 12 10 11 09 10 08 09 07 08 Times Definition Net indebtedness shows debt in relation to operating cash flow 'EBITDAR'. Debt is adjusted net debt, calculated as net debt, the pension deficit and the net present value of lease obligations. Performance Net indebtedness has risen despite a reduction in net debt, due mainly to the decline in EBITDAR driven by our investment in the UK, the regulatory impact in South Korea and challenging economic conditions, particularly in Central Europe.

For example, five-year TSR for 2012 13 is the annualised growth in the share price from 2007 08 and dividends paid and reinvested in Tesco shares, as a percentage of the 2007 08 share price. Performance TSR increased this year, reflecting the effect on our share price of increased investor confidence since last year's decision to invest significantly in our customer offer in the UK. 09 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 54.0% 40.8% 38.4% 39.6% Definition The proportion of net assets financed through debt rather than equity, calculated as net debt divided by total equity.

Capital expenditure 'capex' as % of sales 4. 1% 0 2 4 6 8 12 13 10 11 08 09 06 07 04 05 02 03 % Definition Capex is the investment in property, plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets. This is divided by Group sales inc. VAT, inc. petrol to show a relative investment to sales. Performance This year we continued to reduce our rate of capital investment, focusing on less capital-intensive investments with higher returns, most notably online and convenience. This year our capex was PS3 billion or 4.1% of sales and fell year-on-year in every one of our reporting segments. Going forward, we intend to carefully and appropriately allocate capital within a range of 3.5% to 4% of sales.

It excludes the one-off impact of an increasing provision for customer redress payments including Payment Protection Insurance 'PPI'. Performance Trading profit fell by 15 % impacted by the unwinding of the fair value provision - an accounting adjustment made at the time of acquisition in 2008 - and the run-off in legacy income from the Bank's insurance distribution arrangement with Direct Line Group, which terminated last year. Before these items, profits grew well and are up 13%, with a particularly pleasing performance in customer lending. To put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do Reduction in CO2e emissions from existing stores 09 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 8.5% 4.6% 3.9% 4.9% Definition The year-on-year reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per square foot of sales area from existing stores built before 2006 07. Performance We reduced the CO2e emissions from our stores built before March 2006 by 4.9% compared to last year, exceeding our target of 3.5%, helped by our continued focus across the Group on reducing refrigerant gas leakage. Last year, this KPI included distribution centres 'DCs' in addition to existing stores D. Using this definition, our performance this year is a 4.5% reduction. From next year, we will be measuring the cumulative reduction in CO2e across all of our stores and DCs against a 2006 07 baseline - no matter when they were built. This will simplify our target and is consistent with our 2020 goal to achieve a 50% reduction in emissions per square foot. At the end of 2012 13, we had achieved a reduction of 32.5% towards this goal. These figures have been restated to exclude emissions from existing DCs and from our US operations. D This change was set out in the 2011 12 CR report and the previous year's figures are adjusted accordingly. Additional information can be found at www. Greenhouse gas 'GHG' emission reporting This is a new addition to our Annual Report ahead of the upcoming UK legislation on mandatory greenhouse gas 'GHG' emission reporting that we expect to come into force later this year. This year our carbon footprint was 5.75 million tonnes of CO2e. Our overall carbon intensity has decreased by 30% since 2006 07.

Performance We were just behind our stretching target of 74% and we are confident that we have good plans in place to improve our performance in 2013 14 and beyond. We know that we will only succeed if we have strong relationships with our suppliers. We are launching a new Commercial Food Support Office and simplifying our systems to make it easier for suppliers to do business with us. We will work more closely with suppliers to develop joint business plans and recognise success through our Supplier Values Awards. Donation of pre-tax profits to charities and good causes PS78.1m Definition Our contribution to charities and good causes through direct donations, cause-related marketing, gifts-in-kind, staff time and management costs. Performance We have donated PS78.1 million to charities and good causes this year, compared to PS74.6 million in 2011 12. As a proportion of statutory profit before tax our donations represent 4.0% - an increase on last year's figure of 1.9% reflecting the decline in profits this year. This equates to 2.2% of underlying profit before tax, similar to 1.9% on the same basis last year. We expect to maintain a broadly similar level of contributions going forward with the percentage proportion returning to our usual historical levels in the coming years. Total cash donations for 2012 13 were PS22.2 million. To be a creator of highly valued brands Customer loyalty 8 markets - 1st or 2nd place Source: Market research GFK, Ipsos, Kantar. Definition The number of markets where we are placed first or second for the proportion of customers who do over 50% of their shopping with a single retailer. Performance Building customer loyalty is at the heart of Tesco and we are already ranked first in seven of our markets. This is an important indicator of the strength of the Tesco brand. We earn our customers' loyalty by delivering a great shopping experience and rewarding them for their custom. We now have loyalty schemes in each of our markets. Group-wide own-label participation 38% Tesco own-label brands Definition Own-label sales as a proportion of total Group sales. Own-label sales include Tesco brands such as F&F, Finest or Venture brands and unbranded products, such as produce. Tesco Bank and Tesco Mobile are not included. Performance Group own-label participation was stable in the year. Improving the range and quality of our own-label products is an important part of our plan to improve the shopping trip for customers in the UK. We built on the Everyday Value relaunch early in 2012 13 with range additions in September and made significant improvements in the core Tesco own-label range of products throughout the year. The strategy of improving our Tesco brands will continue in 2013 14. To build our team so that we create more value Colleague retention 91% in the UK Definition The proportion of colleagues with over one year's service who have worked for Tesco in the UK throughout the year. Performance Our retention rate in the UK remains strong, up from 90% in 2011 12. This reflects our focus on creating good jobs and long-term careers, with excellent benefits and career development opportunities. It is also a reflection of our determined and ongoing efforts to make what matters to our colleagues better. For example, through our UK Plan we have made significant investments in training and equipment for our colleagues, supporting them to do their jobs. Colleagues being trained for their next role 5.8% across the Group Definition The proportion of colleagues who are on development programmes training for their next role. Performance Giving our colleagues the opportunity to get on at Tesco is very important to us and we are proud of our commitment to this area. This KPI measures the number of colleagues being trained for their next job through our dedicated 'Options' programme and we narrowly missed this year's increased target of 6% of colleagues. This measure doesn't include other development activities such as apprenticeships, A-level Entry Programmes and our Advanced Leadership Programme. Including these opportunities, almost 7% of colleagues across the Group benefited this year. In addition, we have also heavily invested in our colleagues in the UK this year through our 'Building a Better Tesco' plan. More than 250,000 colleagues in-store have received customer service training, with additional technical training for 36,000 colleagues. 20 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Financial review PS72.4bn Group sales PS3.5bn Group trading profit 35.97p Underlying diluted earnings per share 14.76p Full year dividend per share maintained Laurie McIlwee Chief Financial Officer \" As we adapt to ensure we deliver on our objective to be the best multichannel retailer for our customers, we are realistic in our approach to growth and returns.

Group results and strategic update It has been a year in which we have taken decisive action to focus our efforts on those markets where we can have a leadership position. We exited Japan and launched our strategic review of the United States, while at the same time taking a more measured approach to our growth in China. We also set an appropriate pace of migration for the Bank, keeping it focused on the needs of our most loyal customers. Most importantly, we have begun the essential process of getting the UK business back on track, making sure we protect and build on one of the most important leadership positions we have. Group trading profit declined by 13.0 %, reflecting our investment in the UK, the impact of regulatory changes in South Korea and the challenging economic conditions in Europe. This trading performance coupled with reduced JV income and higher net finance costs led to a decline in Group underlying profit before tax of 14.5 %. com ar2013 to hear more from Laurie McIlwee and other members of the leadership team. 21 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Group statutory profit before tax declined by 51.5 % to PS1,960 million due to the impact of three main one-off charges: UK property write-down of PS 804 million, following an in-depth review of our property pipeline in the context of our fundamentally different approach to new space and our announcement in April 2012 that we would be reducing the level of new space growth in the UK going forward: Goodwill impairment of PS 495 million, reflecting the impact of differing growth prospects in today's environment for the businesses we acquired in Poland, the Czech Republic and Turkey in the mid 1990s to early 2000s: and Increase of PS 115 million in our provision for potential Payment Protection Insurance claims against Tesco Bank. Based on our progress so far with our strategic review of Fresh & Easy, we have confirmed that the outcome of the review will be an exit from the United States. The results of our business there, in addition to those of our business in Japan, have been classified as discontinued operations in these results. Segmental results UK It is a year since we unveiled our six-part plan to get the UK business back on top form. The UK is absolutely fundamental to the success of the Group, which is why this was our number one priority for the year, and I'm pleased to say the plan is very much on track. We have made the investment as planned and it has led to a clear improvement in performance, both in absolute terms and relative to the market. Total sales rose by 2.6% excluding petrol, and like-forlike performance improved during the course of the year, with a particularly encouraging result at Christmas. UK results 2012 13 PSm % growth UK sales PS48,216m 1.8% UK revenue exc. impact of IFRIC 13 PS43,579m 1.8% UK revenue exc. impact of IFRIC 13 2.6% UK trading profit PS2,272m 8.3 % Trading margin trading profit revenue 5.21% 58 bp When we laid out our plans last year, we described the impact of the investment in terms of a rebasing of our trading margin to 5.2% and the progress we have made in the UK has been achieved whilst delivering a margin absolutely in line with these expectations. The most important judge of progress is the customer and we introduced a new way of measuring customer perceptions back in July - our 'customer viewpoint'. This measures real customer feedback in all of our stores on a regular and frequent basis, across 12 aspects of their shopping trip. Pleasingly, every one of these aspects improved throughout the second half of the year. This underpins our confidence that the underlying improvement we have seen in our trading performance is driven by the changes we have made for customers. While there are a number of drivers that could enable us to improve overall UK margins, we believe the new base of 5.2% is appropriate for the foreseeable future and any outperformance will be reinvested in driving additional improvements in our customer offer. Asia Our Asia performance was in line with expectations and was dominated by the South Korean regulatory changes concerning trading hours. These changes held back headline numbers, and the impact on trading profit was broadly in line with our PS 100 million guidance, with significant levels of Sunday store closures throughout the second half and considerable uncertainty in the market about exactly which stores would be closed and when, impacting operations even when stores were able to open. Following the passing of the legislation in January this year, the situation seems more certain, with more consistent store closures expected on alternate Sundays. As such, we expect the full-year effect of the regulations, combined with the extension of 24-hour trading restrictions to between midnight and 10am, to lead to an incremental impact of around PS 40 million in 2013 14.

In Thailand, like-for-like sales grew by 3.1% and we continued to gain market share. We benefited from a strong opening programme, including almost 300 Express stores and we launched our first dotcom grocery operation in Bangkok in February. We have adopted a more cautious stance in China. We still see an excess amount of new space being opened in the market - ahead of customer demand - and we have moderated our pace of development accordingly, opening just 12 new stores this year and closing five underperforming stores as part of our increased focus on our three strongest regions. Europe Whilst our markets in Europe remain fundamentally attractive, our performance this year was disappointing. Clearly, we faced significant headwinds throughout the year, as macroeconomic uncertainties continued to impact businesses. This had a particularly marked impact on our general merchandise businesses across the region, holding back our overall like-for-like sales performance.

The working capital increase was largely as a result of regulatory impacts in a number of markets and the shortening of order lead times for general merchandise which reduced our creditor days. Our return on capital employed, on a continuing operations basis and prior to the impact of one-off charges, is 12.7%. This is a 200 basis point decline on returns calculated on a similar basis for last year, mainly reflecting the trading profit performance. We continued to see strong investor demand for our property during the year. We launched the Tesco Lotus Retail Growth Freehold and Leasehold Property Fund along with a number of transactions in the UK and South Korea, contributing to profits arising on propertyrelated items of PS370 million. The market value of our property across the Group currently exceeds PS38 billion. Since becoming Chief Financial Officer I have made it a priority to improve our debt metrics. Resetting the UK margin, regulatory challenges in South Korea and a disappointing profit performance in Europe have stalled the improvements we have made to date. It is a high priority for the Group to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating. Our target on net indebtedness remains unchanged and it should be achieved within the next couple of years. Fixed charge cover is more challenging because our gross debt has long maturity periods. We have PS2 billion of debt that we can potentially retire over the next three years. Our lower level of sale and leasebacks will help slow down the rising rent bill. Both of these will benefit fixed charge cover. Our improved cash flow growth will help improve retained cash flow to adjusted net debt, a key credit rating measure, underpinning our commitment to maintain a strong investment grade rating. Looking forward - our approach to growth and returns The actions we have taken over the last two years have removed a number of significant barriers to progress and underpin our more disciplined approach to capital allocation. As we adapt to ensure we deliver on our objective to be the best multichannel retailer for our customers, we are realistic in our approach to growth and returns. We can therefore offer clarity to shareholders about how we intend to deliver an appropriate balance of growth and returns in the years ahead. We are managing the business in order to: Generate positive free cash flow Ensure a disciplined allocation of capital within a range of 3.5% to 4% of sales Maintain a strong investment grade credit rating We are therefore allocating our capital to achieve three clear priorities: 1. Continuing to invest in a strong UK business 2. Establishing multichannel leadership in all of our markets 3. Pursuing disciplined international growth Our performance in Hungary and Slovakia, where we enjoy two of our strongest positions, has proved more resilient to the economic headwinds. While our profits in Hungary continued to be held back by the crisis tax this year, this will no longer be applied from the start of our new financial year. In some markets such as the Czech Republic and Poland, we saw increased competitive activity, with those retailers focused on discount small formats faring much better than those - like us - with a greater proportion of larger stores. Our own smaller format stores have performed better than the business as a whole, and our dotcom operations - now in 13 cities in these markets alone - have grown strongly since launch. We have faced particularly intense competition in Turkey, in a year in which we have retrenched from our strategy of pursuing large store expansion to the east of our existing business. Like many other businesses in the country, we faced intense cost-price inflation and the impact of this was exacerbated by a number of one-off, historic issues. The resulting losses contributed to our shortfall versus expectations for European performance. All of our businesses undertake a value in use test each year to justify the carrying value of goodwill. Those businesses acquired in Europe in the 1990s and early 2000s unfortunately face a more difficult market today and different growth prospects as a result. This led to a write-down in the value of acquired goodwill for our businesses in Poland, the Czech Republic and Turkey. Our priority in all of these markets is to get the businesses focused on driving underlying performance and it is for this reason that we will only open 400,000 sq ft of net new selling space in the year ahead. Tesco Bank We were pleased to complete the final stages of migration of Tesco Bank early in the financial year and to be able to get back to focusing on marketing our existing products. Our programme of new products resumed in August with mortgages and more recently, our ISA range. We made progress through the year in banking products, with good growth in both customer accounts and balances. Our insurance business was held back by a very challenging market, with strong downward price pressure in motor insurance. Throughout this period, we focused on ensuring we offer the best products and prices to our loyal Clubcard customers. Tesco Bank results 2012 13 PSm % growth Tesco Bank revenue exc. impact of IFRIC 13 PS1,021m 2.2 % Tesco Bank trading profit PS191m 15.1 % Trading margin trading profit revenue 18.71% 284 bp In recent years, the Bank's profit has been impacted by a couple of non-trading factors - the first, fair value releases and the second, the run-off of our legacy insurance agreement with Direct Line Group. Before these, profits grew well and are up 13% with a particularly pleasing performance in customer lending. In line with the rest of the industry, we have been proactively consulting more widely with our customers on PPI. In light of this contact, it has become necessary to increase our provision for compensation by PS 85 million in the second half. In addition to the PS 30 million provision in the first half, this takes us to a PS 115 million one-off charge. 23 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS This means that, in the current economic environment, investors can expect us to deliver: Mid-single digit trading profit growth Return on capital employed within a range of 12% to 15% Dividend growth, broadly in line with underlying earnings, with a target cover of more than 2 times Generate positive free cash flow Trading profit growth Sustainable ROCE Dividend growth Mid-single digit 12% to 15% range In line with underlying EPS Target cover of more than 2 times Allocate capital within range of 4% down to 3.5% of sales Maintain a strong investment grade credit rating Financial disciplines Guiderails Our approach to growth and returns We will update on our progress in the context of these objectives as part of our future results announcements. As we described earlier, the fundamental change in our approach to new space also has implications for our sale and leaseback programme. Two years ago, we reviewed the programme and announced a steady reduction in the level of divestments, in order to ensure that any property profits released were matched to the level of new profit created by development activities. Given that we have significantly reduced the amount of these activities going forward, we believe that it is appropriate to accelerate the scaling back of the sale and leaseback programme, such that it is unlikely to make a material contribution after the next few years. Our reported underlying profit measure currently includes these property profits and related items, and therefore its growth over the next few years would be held back by this accelerated reduction. We will therefore disclose and adjust for this impact when using underlying earnings per share as the basis for our dividend policy. In doing so, we will better align dividend growth to the key targeted profit performance measure for the business. Growth has always been a central part of the investment case for Tesco. To be clear, it is still at the core of the investment case, but it is now a sustainable level of growth - a growth that enables us to deliver improving returns and a much stronger level of cash generation. The guidance we are sharing is for mid-single digit trading profit growth. This takes into account the structurally changing retailing environment and the lower growth outlook for economies and consumer spending around the world. We are determined to achieve this growth in a balanced way and we see the application of our financial disciplines as an important part of ensuring it is delivered in a way that supports strong, sustainable and attractive returns going forward. We will tightly control our capex. There will likely be a very small increase in 2013 14, as we push on at pace with our refresh plans in the UK. Following this, we will move quickly into and then down through the range we have set out of 4% down to 3.5% of sales. Importantly this will enable us to move to a position where we can produce free cash flow without the historic requirement for property proceeds. This is clearly a significant change from our historic cash flow shape. For a number of years, we relied on property proceeds to fund our investment, as capex exceeded available cash. We are getting close to a position where capex is broadly equivalent to available cash, removing our reliance on these proceeds. From then on, available cash grows and exceeds capex, giving us much greater flexibility from a cash point of view. Protecting our strong position in the UK is still one of our highest priorities. The best returns now are from refreshing our existing stores and investing in the broader multichannel opportunities of convenience and online. We will not invest in those large-store schemes where we see unacceptable returns. We will, of course, continue our process of making our existing large stores even more compelling destinations with the repurposing of space. Our next priority is Asia where modern retail is still very underdeveloped. We will continue to strengthen our positions in Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea. In China, we still see a huge opportunity, although our approach going forward is more measured, focused on stand-alone retail sites in the three regions where we have critical mass and good margins. We will build out the remaining 13 Lifespace malls, but are not committing capital to any new freehold investments beyond these. Finally, in Europe, our large-store networks are largely complete and we are effectively at a maintenance level of capex. Specific capital investments will be considered, but these will be about improving the assets we have and expanding in low capital formats such as the internet and convenience. More of our capital will be going into already high-returning businesses and into driving forward returns in our immature businesses. This allocation will enable us to produce a steady improvement in return on capital employed from the current base, within a range of 12% to 15%. The approach I have laid out above provides appropriate and realistic objectives for the business. As we deliver our objective of being the leading multichannel retailer, we are determined to do even better - for customers and for shareholders. Laurie McIlwee Chief Financial Officer",

Given the weak overall market and the company\u2019s efforts to restructure and invest in multichannel leadership, this notable rise in **ROE** suggests that Tesco is outperforming typical industry growth rates, which have generally been pressured.\n\n- **Is growth persistent or temporary?**  \n  The report indicates that Tesco is balancing short-term financial constraints with strategic investments aimed at long-term value creation, such as multichannel expansion and brand rebuilding. While current financial performance is constrained, the company is confident about its future leadership position. Therefore, the **ROE** growth appears to be moving towards persistence, supported by strategic initiatives rather than a temporary spike.\n\n# Forecasts:\n- Expected **ROE** next year is likely to continue improving moderately as the company\u2019s investments in multichannel retailing and operational improvements begin to yield stronger financial returns.\n- Short-term constraints on financial performance will persist, but ongoing initiatives to improve customer loyalty, pricing, and store formats should sustain upward **ROE** momentum.\n- External risks such as economic uncertainty in key markets and regulatory challenges may temper the pace of **ROE** growth.\n\n# Summary:\n- Tesco\u2019s **ROE** rose sharply from **0.0075** to **0.0662**, reflecting improved profitability and more efficient use of equity.\n- This growth is notable in the context of a challenging retail sector with weak consumer spending and strong competition.\n- The company\u2019s strategic focus on multichannel leadership and disciplined capital allocation supports the sustainability of this **ROE** improvement.\n- Ongoing investments in brand rebuilding, pricing, and convenience stores should further enhance returns.\n- Risks remain from economic and regulatory factors, particularly in international markets.\n- Tesco\u2019s balance sheet discipline and stable dividend policy support investor confidence amid transformation.\n- The company is transitioning from addressing past issues towards accelerating future growth and value creation.\n- Tesco Bank\u2019s growth and expansion of financial services add a complementary source of profitability.\n- The reported **ROE** improvement aligns with a broader strategic repositioning aiming to make Tesco a leader in the evolving retail landscape.\n- Overall, the company shows positive momentum but must carefully manage execution risks to sustain **ROE** growth.",
        "Detailed Analysis of ROE Drivers": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?**  \n  The growth in ROE is driven primarily by a significant increase in **Profit Margin** from 0.19% to 1.53%, indicating improved profitability. However, **Assets Turnover** declined from 4.95 to 4.08, showing reduced efficiency in asset utilization. This suggests that the ROE growth is mainly margin-driven rather than efficiency-driven.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  The textual report does not provide explicit competitor or industry benchmark ratios, but the **Profit Margin** improvement is notable given the challenging trading conditions cited. The decline in **Assets Turnover** suggests some operational inefficiencies or changes in asset base, possibly due to investments in store refurbishments and multichannel capabilities. Overall, margin improvement is a positive sign, but efficiency has weakened relative to the prior year.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year:** Given the ongoing investment in larger store refreshes and multichannel infrastructure, **Asset Turnover** may stabilize or slightly improve but is unlikely to return to previous levels immediately; forecast around **4.1**.  \n- **Expected Profit Margin next year:** With continued focus on pricing, range, quality, and service improvements, and assuming market conditions stabilize, **Profit Margin** is expected to improve further; forecast around **1.7% to 2.0%**.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The company's **ROE growth** is predominantly driven by a substantial increase in **Profit Margin**, reflecting better cost control and pricing strategies amidst market challenges.  \n- The decline in **Assets Turnover** highlights a reduction in operational efficiency, possibly due to capital investments and slower sales growth in certain segments.  \n- Given the strategic emphasis on multichannel retailing and store refreshment, the outlook favors continued margin improvement with gradual recovery in efficiency, supporting sustainable ROE growth.",
        "Detailed Analysis of Risk": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Are risks increasing or declining?**  \n  Risks appear to be increasing, particularly financial and legal risks. The NLP financial risk increased from **0.67** to **0.79**, and NLP legal risk surged significantly from **0.20** to **0.76**. Tax risk has slightly decreased but remains elevated at **0.60** compared to **0.69** last year.\n\n- **Is the number and severity of risks higher than competitors/industry?**  \n  While the report does not provide explicit competitor comparisons, the sharp increase in legal and financial risks, combined with a rising gearing ratio, suggests the company may be experiencing above-average risk levels compared to a typical retail sector benchmark.\n\n- **Is sentiment increasing or declining?**  \n  Sentiment appears to be increasing slightly, as reflected in the NLP sentence length rising from **27.08** to **31.11** and a small increase in the current ratio and quick ratio, signaling a marginally improved liquidity position.\n\n- **Is specificity increasing or declining?**  \n  Specificity is declining slightly, with NLP specificity decreasing from **0.0739** to **0.0708**, indicating potentially less detailed risk disclosures or vaguer language around risk issues.\n\n- **Are complexity measures increasing or declining?**  \n  Complexity, measured by NLP sentence depth, is declining marginally from **6.58** to **6.43**, suggesting slightly simpler sentence structures are being used in risk disclosures.\n\n- **How are sentiment, specificity, and complexity compared to competitors?**  \n  Without explicit competitor data, the company's increased sentiment but decreased specificity and complexity suggest that while risk communications are becoming more verbose, they may be less detailed and somewhat simplified compared to industry best practices, potentially reducing transparency.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Is Gearing expected to increase next year?**  \n  Given the increase from **1.75** to **2.09** this year and continued capital discipline challenges, **Gearing is likely to increase or remain elevated next year**.\n\n- **Is Current Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The current ratio has improved slightly from **0.69** to **0.73**, indicating a positive short-term liquidity trend, so the **Current Ratio is expected to increase modestly next year**.\n\n- **Is Quick Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The quick ratio shows a marginal increase from **0.16** to **0.17**, suggesting **a slight increase in quick ratio is expected next year**, though it remains low.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The company is facing **increasing financial and legal risks**, as shown by rising NLP risk scores and a higher gearing ratio, reflecting increased leverage.  \n- **Sentiment in risk disclosures is increasing**, but the **decline in specificity and complexity suggests risk reporting may be becoming less detailed and transparent**, potentially reducing stakeholder confidence.  \n- Liquidity ratios such as **current and quick ratios show slight improvement**, but remain below ideal thresholds, indicating continued pressure on short-term financial stability.  \n- The company is actively managing risk through governance and controls but faces challenges from economic, political, and regulatory volatility, especially in international markets.  \n- Overall, increased risk exposure combined with moderate liquidity improvement signals a cautious outlook requiring vigilant financial management and enhanced transparency.",

        "full_report_sentence": "The future: strategic developments in retail The backdrop of technology-driven change in the retail sector becomes a more insistent drumbeat every day. Boundaries between the online and offline world are becoming blurred. The challenge, and opportunity, for retailers is not just to have and be able to operate across multiple channels. It is to meet the rapid changes in consumer behaviour that we are seeing as technology opens up new horizons for them. The capacity for consumers to communicate instantly with each other, with us and with other retailers is driving completely different expectations for service levels, choice, convenience, indeed the whole shopping experience. A level of customisation and personalisation, unthinkable a decade ago is becoming the norm. Consequently, being a leading retailer today is not a guarantee of value creation tomorrow. We need to ensure that we are tomorrow's leading retailer. We had already set ourselves on the path to becoming a leading multichannel retailer to meet this challenge. The accelerating evolution of customer behaviours reinforces us in this choice of direction and has led us in the past year progressively to intensify our actions to deliver this end. This includes not only ensuring a more seamless service for customers but also a business which matches more closely what they want, for example by making our larger stores more compelling destinations in their own right as well as ensuring we offer more convenience stores. Our task is to allocate resources to compete effectively in today's market while giving priority to ensuring that we emerge as winners in the coming multichannel, customer-centric market. Your Board is extremely focused on the need to manage this balance between current and future returns with great care, optimising both without imperilling either. The business is taking decisive steps to free up capital and operational resources, but for the time being the imperative of securing the longer-term future means that our current financial performance remains constrained. Other business priorities In my foreword last year, I said: \" Our strategic choices are defined by three parameters: the strength of the T esco brand: the internet and all the associated developments it is driving: and the potential to leverage our skill and scale internationally... \" I have remarked on the fundamental re-orientation of the business to meet the changes being driven by the internet. Let me say a word about brand: and about how we view our international businesses. Sir Richard Broadbent Chairman Continuity and change This has been an important year for T esco. There has been a great deal to occupy us in relation to current trading as weak markets and intense competition persist. At the same time, we continue to reshape the business to address the fundamental changes taking place in the retail market. The challenging trading conditions of the past year have impacted profits and necessarily remain a focus of management attention. We continue to devote a lot of energy and creativity to creating products and services which customers want to buy at prices they find attractive, through whichever channel they choose and which leave them wanting to visit us again. We have continued to focus on improving the experience for customers with continued investment in colleagues, a big programme of store refurbishment, significant investment in quality and a renewal of product ranges, including the entire finest range, and a continued emphasis on Building a Better T esco in the widest sense of the term. More broadly, however, it has been a year when your company has moved from addressing existing business issues to driving our strategy for future growth and value. There is never a year in which a business focuses solely on one or the other. But it is fair to say that at some point in the past year the balance of where our energies and resources are focused tipped from addressing past issues to investing in the future. We remain focused on the present but we are starting to quicken our pace into the future. \" Being a leading retailer today is not a guarantee of value creation tomorrow. We need to ensure that we are tomorrow's leading retailer. \" com ar2014 to hear more from Sir Richard Broadbent and other members of the leadership team Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 01 Chairman's statement through levels of transparency and disclosure which are undoubtedly now world-leading. We were pleased to welcome Mark Armour to the Board in September last year and the expertise, rooted in a long business career, that he brings to our discussions. We announced on 4 April that Laurie McIlwee had resigned from his position as Chief Financial Officer. I would like to thank Laurie for his contribution to Tesco over the last 14 years. Together with Philip and the wider team, Laurie has played an important role in our process to transform Tesco and position it to be a winner in the new era of retailing. I and the Board wish him every success for the future. Financial results Our task is to deliver value to our shareholders and we hold this goal in mind in all our deliberations. The trade-offs at the present time are not straightforward and we continually track the balance between future value and current return, seeking to ensure an optimum balance between the two in the context of the rapid changes which the retail sector is experiencing. This is reflected in a number of one-off write-offs associated with significant business or market developments and in our results generally which have again been held back by the factors I have described. Revenues from continuing operations were broadly flat and underlying profit fell by 6.9 %. We understand the importance of the dividend to our shareholders and our confidence in the strategic choices we are making is reflected in an unchanged dividend. Conclusion In pursuing our goals, the most important resource we have is our colleagues who are the ones who work unfailingly to anticipate and meet the needs of customers, and I and the whole Board are grateful to each and every one of them for all that they do. The future is a retail world where retailers will need to operate across multiple channels while meeting wholly different customer expectations for service levels, choice, convenience and overall experience. You may be assured that we will compete hard in the current market but the bigger prize we seek on your behalf is to utilise the unique assets and resources of T esco to ensure we emerge as leaders in the future world of retailing. Sir Richard Broadbent Chairman The Tesco brand Re-building the T esco brand to become synonymous again with value, choice and quality, to be seen again as unerringly on the customers' side, is central to our future. In the multichannel world we are moving into, what you are known for will be as important as the channels through which you sell. We have and will continue therefore the patient work to strengthen trust in our brand. This is not without its cost but we believe it is as important an investment as any other part of our strategy. Values are central to any brand and last year we took the major step of introducing a new Value: we use our scale for good. This is evidently a long-term project but the year has seen the first steps taken to embed this sentiment as a touchstone of the business. These are reported in more detail in our separate update of \"T esco and Society\" which is being published alongside this report. International Our priority is to deliver value to our shareholders. The last two years or so have seen us address tough decisions in relation to the international business. That said, we continue to see opportunity to create value internationally by leveraging our skills and scale in relatively rapidly growing economies with less developed modern retail sectors where the rate of economic growth coupled with switching to modern retail outlets can generate attractive returns. Such opportunities need to be taken with focus, flexibility and care. The completion in the past year of our exit from the US underpins the importance of piloting new ventures: of being open to partnership especially in new markets: to selecting rigorously those markets that meet tightly-drawn criteria for investment: and to ensure close management and control of the investments. Many of our choices this year, to enter partnerships in China and India or to invest modestly in an internet start-up in South East Asia, reflect this philosophy of establishing a position of opportunity and testing returns against our criteria as a basis for building long-term, value-enhancing positions. Governance In common with other public companies, we are meeting this year new standards of disclosure. Our Remuneration Policy is set out on pages 41 to 61 for shareholders to consider. Our accounts as a whole have been considered by the Board in the light of the new test to be \"fair, balanced and understandable. \" We have taken seriously the spirit as well as the letter of the new Regulations, which are seeking to build trust between the corporate sector and society generally \" The future is a retail world where retailers will need to operate across multiple channels while meeting wholly different customer expectations for service levels, choice, convenience and overall experience. \" 02 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Chairman's statement continued experiencing and we have focused our resources on building on these strengths. Two years ago, I also outlined plans to deal with the more T esco-specific issues by improving our offer for customers in the UK through a programme of investment in improved service, quality and price. It was important that we started when we did, and this programme of improvement continues and is being accelerated as competitive conditions intensify. With our strategy already in place, we know what we need to do, and we know that we have to do it even more quickly. These issues do mean that our headline numbers are not where we want or planned for them to be. We have taken decisive action to improve performance, but the issues we face cannot all be fixed overnight. We need to do more, we need to go faster. I am, however, confident that we have the right strategies and the right team to compete effectively in the current market and to ensure that we emerge a leader in the multichannel world of retailing. Progress in 2013 14 We laid out our three strategic priorities for the business in April 2013: 1. Continuing to invest in a strong UK business 2. Establishing multichannel leadership in all of our markets 3. Pursuing disciplined international growth These priorities are even more relevant today than they were when I announced them and we have made progress on each of them. Continuing to invest in a strong UK business We launched the Building a Better T esco plan in the UK two years ago and invested PS1 billion in six key areas of the business: Service & Staff, Stores & Formats, Range & Quality, Price & Value, Brand & Marketing and Clicks & Bricks. As I made clear at the time, we had been running our stores 'too hot' for too long and this investment was long-overdue. I have described below some of the progress we have made under each of the areas of the plan. i Service & Staff Having taken on 8,000 more colleagues in our stores, this year we'five focused on providing further customer service training. We have delivered training to more than 250,000 colleagues in the UK, helping them to make every moment with customers matter. We have rescheduled 300,000 hours in the last year with the aim of having the right number of colleagues in our stores, in the right departments and at times of the day that customers need them most. We are seeing improvements in customer perceptions and the proportion of customers Introduction This year marks my 40th year at T esco. I have found every single one of those years exciting and challenging, but I have never seen such a pace of change within the industry as I have over the past year, driven by both structural and cyclical forces. Consumer behaviours are changing more quickly than ever before and that means we have to accelerate our rate of change too. Customers are increasingly using technology in all aspects of their everyday lives and the pace of transition to online shopping has been even faster than we expected. Since taking over as Chief Executive of your business in 2011, I have been clear of the need to transform T esco to be a leader in the multichannel retail environment. The way the market has developed since then has underlined the importance of this strategic choice. At the same time, consumer behaviours continue to be strongly influenced by economic conditions which have continued to be tough in the markets in which we operate. Overall, consumers are spending more carefully. They are increasingly choosing to shop online or in smaller convenience stores rather than in large stores, which presents a particular challenge for T esco given the number of large stores we have around the world. So we face a mix of T esco-specific issues and broader issues affecting the whole sector and it is important that we tackle both. This is a large agenda and has kept us fully occupied over the past year. Thanks to the foresight of my predecessors, over the course of more than 17 years, we'five already developed strong online and convenience businesses. This has ensured we are well-positioned to address the industry-wide changes we are Philip Clarke Chief Executive Our strategy has been developed to drive sustainable growth through three priorities: 1. Pursuing disciplined international growth Further discussion around each of these priorities is provided within my report on the following pages. Our strategic priorities Visit www. com ar2014 to hear more from Philip Clarke and other members of the leadership team Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 03 Report from the Chief Executive Whilst the direct impact of the meat contamination issue last year was limited to just four of our products, we have made marked improvements in the supply chain, shortening its length and focusing on provenance, greater control and traceability. Through our world-class testing programme, we have tested over 5,300 products and we are the first major retailer to offer two-year direct contracts for beef and lamb farmers right back to the farm gate. More than 300 farmers have signed up already. iv Price & Value Customers are actively seeking the best value, and this is more important than ever in a market which has become even more competitive over recent months. It is essential that customers can trust our prices. We want prices to be stable, we want them to be logical and, of course, we want them to be competitive. Our Price Promise has now been in place for over a year and provides instant reassurance to customers that on fresh foods, on own-label and on branded products they will not lose out at T esco. Every customer perception measure on price has improved over the last 12 months, but there is still more to do on pricing. We know how important it is to customers that they get the best possible prices on lines that matter most to them. That is why in February, we announced that we are accelerating the pace of change including an initial investment of PS200 million in bringing down, and keeping down, prices of key lines, starting with milk, carrots, onions and eggs. Y ou can be sure that we will continue to focus relentlessly on ensuring we are competitive in the marketplace and where we need to do more, we will do more. v Brand & Marketing Clubcard is more important now than it has ever been before. It is at the core of providing a differentiated, personalised offer and it allows customers to choose how to unlock greater value for themselves. It is at the heart of our unique relationship with our customers and we need to use the power of Clubcard to personalise how we communicate with and serve our customers, providing them with offers and services which are relevant and tailored to how they live their lives. We are using Clubcard to deliver more value for customers and have delivered almost 60 million personalised mailings this year for products that customers buy week in, week out. A good example of the power of Clubcard and of the advocacy that it can drive is the launch of Clubcard Fuel Save. It is a completely new concept for the UK retail industry. Customers can earn money off their fuel, just by doing their normal shopping. It is inclusive - every penny counts towards the level of saving whether customers are shopping online for their rating customer service and staff helpfulness as excellent has improved by 40% since 2012. We know we need to do more in order to make service a point of difference for us and to deliver excellent customer service for every customer on every shopping trip. This will remain a key priority for the UK business in the coming year. ii Stores & Formats Over the last two years, we have refreshed over a third of our UK stores in some way. This work has involved improvements to store environments and has prioritised the departments that matter most to customers, primarily fresh food. We have applied the learnings from each phase of the refresh programme to the next, enhancing our approach as the programme has evolved. As a result, there are some newer initiatives that we will seek to introduce to some of the stores that formed the early part of the refresh programme. Following the trial stores we completed in 2012 13, our refresh programme to date has been more focused on our Express format and on our smaller Superstores. Given the change in shopping behaviours I mentioned above, our larger stores have been a drag on performance and this is one of the most important areas that we need to address. Therefore, the focus of our refresh programme will now be on reinventing our largest stores to ensure that they are worth the trip for customers. This year we have tested a number of ingredients for our Extra refresh programme, and begun to roll out a range of components to help make these stores relevant destinations that customers actively choose to visit. In 2014 15 we will refresh 110 of our Extra stores, aiming to make them even stronger destinations. More of the ingredients will appear in these larger stores and typically they will feature strong clothing and general merchandise as well as tailored new food experiences, such as Giraffe, Euphorium, Harris Hoole and Decks dependent upon the local customer. We will also be working hard to put 'Food First' and create the best ranges of fresh foods. We are looking forward to accelerating the appearance of these new features in our stores over the next three years. While this refresh work causes some short-term disruption, the resulting uplifts will be long-lasting. iii Range & Quality This year, we completed the work to materially improve our 8,000 core T esco products. Following the relaunch of our finest range in October, we relaunched our Healthy Living range in January. The customer response to the improvements we have made across our T esco products has been pleasing, and our own-label sales account for around half of our total UK sales excluding petrol. This year, we completed the work to materially improve our 8,000 core T esco products. \" We want prices to be stable, we want them to be logical and, of course, we want them to be competitive. \" 04 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Report from the Chief Executive continued T matter most, more product innovation and quality improvements that delight, new and improved general merchandise ranges and more Extra stores becoming destinations worth a trip in their own right, while our convenience stores will be best in class. Our attention to service levels will intensify and we will deliver exceptional value for customers through Clubcard, just as we are doing through the recent launch of Clubcard Fuel Save. It is this combination of accelerating growth in new channels while investing in sharper prices, improved quality, stronger ranges and better service that places a strain on short-term results. But it is also this combination of actions and strategic choice that will deliver sustainable long-term value. Where we have moved - for example in ending the UK space race, in focusing on cash and capital discipline, in developing grocery home shopping - others in the sector have followed. Our aim is to continue to lead, recognising that structural change on this scale is a long game and it is in our interest - and your interest - to be a long-term winner. Establishing multichannel leadership in all of our markets Against the backdrop of an accelerating shift to online shopping, our priority of establishing multichannel leadership in all of our markets has never been more relevant. Customers' behaviours are changing, their expectations of retailers continue to rise and they want to be able to shop however, whenever and wherever they want. We are moving from the first curve of retailing - one of bricks and mortar - to the second curve built around a seamless blend of bricks and clicks. Establishing multichannel leadership is about putting the customer at the centre of our offer and building a seamless experience around them, whether they want to shop in store, online, in our restaurants, at the Bank or across a combination of them all. Customer journeys are becoming more complex. Customers bounce between channels and devices in whichever way they choose and they expect a seamless experience. Our goal is to provide a zero-defect, end-to-end experience however our customers want to shop. While this presents challenges, it brings lots of opportunities too. Our scale, and our existing strengths from the first curve world, mean we are uniquely placed to lead in this new world. It is clear to us that those customers who choose to shop across more channels with us spend more and are more loyal to T esco. Identifying our most valuable customers and enabling them to shop with us however, whenever and wherever they want is our opportunity. We have some ambitious goals and bold plans for our multichannel business in weekly shop or popping in store for a sandwich, and they are in control of when they redeem their saving too. In just the first few weeks, more than three million customers saved money on fuel. Clubcard Fuel Save is one example of the things we are doing to improve loyalty. Loyalty has always been important to T esco because greater loyalty delivers greater lifetime value. vi Clicks & Bricks As I have already referenced, the pace of the transition to online is rapid. This creates challenges for the industry but we have a market-leading, profitable grocery home shopping business that already generates PS2.5 billion of sales in the UK. By any measure our service is industryleading, and it represents a world-class platform from which to build our position of leadership in the multichannel world. Our Delivery Saver subscription service, which only launched in May 2012, is used by over 200,000 customers. We offer one-hour delivery slots in over 98% of the UK and Grocery Click & Collect is available at 260 locations. T esco has always been about making products previously seen as unattainable more accessible. So we were especially proud of the launch of Hudl - our very own tablet - which made tablet devices much more accessible to more families across the UK. It proved extremely popular with customers, exceeding our own expectations, and earned outstanding reviews from the technology press. It was recently named 'ReThink Retail T echnology Initiative of the Y ear' at the Retail Week Awards and we plan to launch a second device later this year. Accelerating our plans for customers in the UK I am clear that we have strengthened the foundations of the UK business, but I am also clear that we need to do more. Above all else, we are focused on delivering the most compelling offer for customers and we are accelerating our plans. Consequently, over the coming months you will see a continuing focus on every day low prices on the lines that \" The pace of the transition to online is rapid. This creates challenges for the industry but we have a market-leading, profitable grocery home shopping business. \" \" A good example of the power of Clubcard and of the advocacy that it can drive is the launch of Clubcard Fuel Save. \" Establishing multichannel leadership is about putting the customer at the centre of our offer and building a seamless experience around them, whether they want to shop in a store, online, in our restaurants, at the Bank or across a combination of them all. Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 05 Our work, however, to refresh seven of our largest stores, including our stores in Dongsuwon and Yuseong, has delivered encouraging results. We also continued to grow our convenience portfolio, with the opening of 71 '365 plus' franchise stores. We have had a challenging year in Thailand, reflecting the impact of the recessionary conditions on consumers and the political unrest. Thailand is one of our largest international markets and we have implemented a strong plan to improve our offer. We have continued to build a strong multichannel business, growing our grocery home shopping and convenience businesses to almost 1,400 convenience stores. In Malaysia, our performance has been more resilient. We opened two new stores during the year and grew our grocery home shopping business in its first year of operation. In Europe, we faced weak momentum running into the start of the year and the challenges were common across our markets with larger stores under-performing. Addressing these challenges we have tailored our plans in each market to provide a more compelling fresh offer, focusing on seasonal events and leveraging our sourcing scale and supply chain capability. We have also used our strengths in Clubcard and F&F to drive further improvements in our offer for customers. Turkey in particular has faced very challenging economic and competitive conditions and our focus is on finding a profitable model for a country with excellent long-term potential. We are in early stage discussions with potential partners and, should that not prove successful, we also have a range of realistic alternative options. An excellent example of our strategy in action is our partnership with China Resources Enterprise Ltd. Subject to the usual regulatory approvals, it will give T esco a 20% ownership stake of the largest food retail business in China. The joint venture, which will be self-funding going forward, will secure significant cost and operational synergies, and will move us more quickly to profitability in what is one of the world' s most exciting retail markets alongside an expert local partner. We have entered into an agreement with Trent Limited, part of the T ata Group, to form a 50:50 joint venture with Trent Hypermarket Limited, developing our presence in the Indian market. We firmly believe that our partnerships in both China and India will allow us to capitalise on these enormously exciting markets in a way which is disciplined in our use of capital and focused on profitable growth. 2014 15: to provide market-leading delivery pricing, twice the number of Click & Collect locations, including alternative locations such as London tube stations, and added-value products and services, including T esco Bank's current account and digital wallet. In the medium term, we will offer one-hour delivery slots to the whole of the UK, for non-food as well as food, and for third-party sellers as well as our own products. By doing so, we will effectively create an e-commerce infrastructure not just for T esco but for others as well. It is because we have the potential to innovate on this scale that we believe your company will emerge a winner in the coming multichannel world of retailing. Pursuing disciplined international growth Last year, I described our international markets in three cohorts: South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand - markets with significant future potential Ireland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - markets where we are focused on holding our position and improving returns China, India and Turkey - markets where we know we must refocus on a more profitable approach to growth Through our international businesses we have the opportunity to create value for customers and shareholders by leveraging the know-how that we have gained from nine decades of retailing in addition to using our scale to better effect across the Group. As well as doing even more to improve our customer offer across all our markets, we'five taken action to ensure that this value is realised across each of these three cohorts. In line with our third strategic priority, we have applied an even greater level of capital discipline. While we continue to allocate capital to markets where we see greatest potential for growth, our investment is lower than previous years and will fall even further as part of our commitment that Group-wide capital expenditure will be no more than PS2.5 billion for at least the next three financial years. We are spending more on our existing space due to our accelerated refresh programme, we are maintaining our level of spend on technology and we're spending significantly less on new space. T aking our Asian businesses first, we have a strong position in South Korea and it remains a high-returning business for us, but the sales trends have not been as we would have wanted them to be in the last two years. The regulatory restrictions on store opening hours have continued to impact our sales. \" Through our international businesses we have the opportunity to create value for customers and shareholders by leveraging the know-how that we have gained from nine decades of retailing. \" 06 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Report from the Chief Executive continued throughout the business. One of the biggest changes we have made over the last year is in the scale of our engagement. We are joining the global conversation around each of the issues and are working hard to move to a more open, transparent conversation, sharing details of our activities, progress and challenges through our different channels. We want to make significant, lasting changes, not launch short-term superficial initiatives, and that's why the focus of this year has been gathering the best possible insights to set long-term direction. This insight-to-action approach holds the key to our success for the future. It's the theme of this year's T esco and Society report, which is published alongside this report. I'm confident that if we continue down this path over the coming years, we can use our scale for good across society and make what matters better, together. Management I would like to thank Laurie McIlwee for his contribution as CFO over the last five years, in particular to the progress we have made on our strategic priorities in the last three years, and before that his very good work on UK distribution. I wish him all the best for the future. Our Executive Committee has grown stronger this year, welcoming Steve Rigby and David Hobbs, and I am confident that we have the right team to deliver our strategy. Conclusion While we do face short-term challenges, I am excited about the future. We see many more opportunities for the medium term and beyond. As customers' expectations of retailers evolve and we move into the new era of retail, we believe we are uniquely placed to lead. T esco has always innovated for its customers. We have the building blocks which will be essential for us to lead in the future: an industry-leading online offer, unrivalled customer insight through Clubcard, a first-class portfolio of stores, and an outstanding team of over 500,000 colleagues around the world who are working harder every day to deliver for our customers. In a rapidly changing market, retaining flexibility is essential and we are confident that we have a business plan which is right for today's market, and that we are making the strategic decisions to deliver leadership in tomorrow's market. Philip Clarke Chief Executive Measuring our progress The single most important theme running through all the developments I have discussed is that stores are no longer necessarily the central point of our relationship with customers. Consequently we are re-orientating the indicators we use to measure and judge our progress to centre them firmly on the customer. Our customers are at the centre of all our strategic decisions. Quite simply, everything we are doing is designed to retain our loyal customers and attract more new ones who shop across our channels and brands. That is how companies build enduring like-for-like sales. We are prioritising five key performance indicators which will help us measure and communicate our progress against our strategy. These measures place customers, and how they want to shop today right at the heart of everything we do. Focusing on driving customer loyalty and improving sales will lead to sustainable profits, returns and growth over the medium term. Y ou can read more about our new key performance indicators and how we are measuring performance of the business on pages 16 to 18. Tesco Bank Our vision is to be the bank for T esco customers and to offer simple, transparent and convenient products which reward our customers' loyalty and strengthen their bond with our business. This year we have seen good growth in our core banking products with customer accounts for credit cards, loans, mortgages and savings up 14%. In its first full year of trading, our mortgage product has made good progress with balances reaching PS0.7 billion. We remain on track to launch current accounts in the first half of 2014 15. Using our scale for good Last year we embraced a new Value for the business, recognising that when you are a large company, there is a particular responsibility to be aware of how your actions affect others. This Value is: we use our scale for good. It is based on the recognition that if we harness the breadth of our skills and scale and work together with our partners in the supply chain, we can make a major contribution to some of the biggest challenges facing the communities in which we operate, across the world. As part of this, we chose to take a lead in addressing three challenges which are particularly relevant to us as a large global retailer and are important to our colleagues and customers: reducing food waste globally, improving health and providing opportunities for millions of young people. We have started the journey of tackling these issues and we are embedding this new Value For more information about our new key performance indicators and how we are measuring our progress, see pages 16 to 18. \" We firmly believe that our partnerships in both China and India will allow us to capitalise on these enormously exciting markets in a way which is disciplined in our use of capital and focused on profitable growth. \" Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 07 % 50 40 30 20 10 Jan '11 Jan '14 Jan '12 Jan '13 Jan '09 Jan '10 Macro trends Consumer trends 29% in 2009 49% in 2013 PS Get better Get worse of UK customers use a mobile phone to compare prices or look up customer reviews while in store As customers increasingly choose to shop across different store formats and online, they are looking to retailers to provide a truly seamless, multichannel offer. These changes to customer behaviour and shopping habits come in the context of continuing economic pressure on household budgets and competitive environments in all 12 of our markets. T echnology is changing the way we consume. The role that it plays in customers' lives has changed as it becomes a fundamental, essential part of everyday life - a way to stay connected, to manage banking and bills, a part of education and often essential for work. While the pace of adoption of online shopping, particularly for groceries, across our markets is unclear, the transition is certainly well underway. It is not just transactional - consumers are increasingly using the internet to research purchases. In the UK, for example, over half of purchases are influenced by digital channels, 63% of shoppers use their smartphone in store and 43% of customers use a mobile phone to compare prices or look up customer reviews while shopping in store. The influence of the internet is rising across all our markets: two thirds of Malaysians have access to the internet, for example, while almost half of Czechs own a smartphone. Technology is changing the way we consume. The role that it plays in customers' lives has changed from being a practical tool to becoming a much more fundamental and essential part of life. UK consumers: how do you expect the financial position of your household to change over the next few months? The rise of technology Proportion of UK customers shopping three or more times a week for food and groceries 43% More frequent shopping In the UK, we use our unique insight from dunnhumby to track how British consumers feel about the economy in general, as well as their own individual situations. Our latest quarterly Consumer T oday report shows that although some consumers are starting to feel more upbeat about an improving economy, they are yet to feel the benefit in their own pockets. That is why we remain very focused on helping customers to manage their budgets by offering them great value for money across their shop. In Central Europe, after a prolonged period of economic pressure, employment levels and consumer confidence are rising, albeit from historically low levels, and real incomes are starting to benefit from lower inflation. Nonetheless, household expenditure is yet to improve significantly. Although some economies in Asia are rapidly expanding, Thailand fell into recession during the year and consumers struggled with higher levels of debt. Thai consumer confidence was further affected by the escalation of political unrest in the second half of the year. In South Korea consumer confidence has been on a marked upward trend through the year but household debt has reached record highs. Consumer confidence in Malaysia has fallen due to concerns over inflation, low wage growth and a proposed sales tax. Populations are ageing and household sizes are declining across our markets. In Asia for example, 50% of South Korean households comprise one or two people - a trend also seen in Thailand, in part due to rapid urbanisation. This changing household composition is one factor leading to an increasing preference for convenience shopping. We believe that in the longer term rising populations, rapid urbanisation and a growing demand for agricultural products present a risk to global food security and highlight the importance of building sustainable supply chains. More information about our work to increase the sustainability of our supply chain is available in the T esco and Society Report. Source: 'The Consumer T oday', dunnhumby, February 2014 The economic environment has continued to be challenging in all of our markets. Although there are signs of improvement beginning to appear, we don't yet see consumers spending more. 08 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Market overview 2009 Source: IGD Datacentre 6,000 5,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 0 '000 sq ft 2010 2011 2012 2013 In-store only In-store online grocery In-store online grocery general merchandise online Average annual spend with T esco In-store General merchandise online Online grocery 2.98x 2.04x Multichannel Net new space Industry trends 38% less new space than in 2009 Multichannel cuts across the digital and the physical. It is transactional and non-transactional. It is not just about selling products but also about the way we interact with and engage customers. Being truly multichannel is not just about having a website - it is about putting the customer at the heart of our business and giving them one seamless, joined-up relationship, be that through media, social media or even a customer service desk in store. Customers value retailers who get it right In the UK, food retail sales growth has remained subdued over the last year, reflecting the challenging economic environment and continuing pressure on consumers. Although new space has been a key driver of top-line growth for many in the industry, we have seen a reduction in large store openings. In the UK net new space among the largest four grocery retailers in 2013 was 38% lower than in 2009. In many of our markets performance of larger stores has been more challenged. In response to a consumer desire to shop more frequently and closer to home, many retailers are focusing their opening programmes on the convenience market and smaller format stores. An acceleration in openings of small format stores is something we have also observed in our European and Asian markets. In the UK the online grocery market has continued to grow strongly, with all the major UK food retailers now operating a grocery home shopping service. We have also seen a rapid growth in Click & Collect over the last year, including trials of non-store collection locations. While online grocery is still in its infancy in Central Europe and Asia we expect it to continue to grow. In Poland, for example, the value of the online food market doubled in size from 2008 to 2011, and is expected to have more than doubled again by 2014. Across our markets the industry remains highly competitive. In the UK and Europe the discounters continue to grow market share and open new stores. Promotional intensity has remained elevated in the UK and couponing has been a feature in many of our markets. We have seen continued development of own-brand products by retailers across the globe as they seek to appeal to broader groups of consumers and respond to demand for better value. In the UK, food retail sales growth has remained subdued over the last year, reflecting the challenging economic environment and continuing pressure on consumers. With this rise of technology and digital capabilities, consumers are changing the way they shop. Customers want to be able to shop however, whenever and wherever they want. They want to shop across store formats, on smartphones and on tablets. They are no longer choosing just a simple trip to a store, but are making much more dynamic and complex journeys to purchase. They are bouncing between channels, placing an order online and picking it up in store, for example. They are combining fewer big shopping trips with more frequent, top-up shops at convenience stores. As their behaviour is changing their expectations UK largest four grocery retailers of retailers are changing too and they are looking to retailers to provide a truly multichannel offer - one that joins up all the different channels to give them a seamless experience. Value continues to be a priority for consumers across our markets and they are changing the way they shop in order to find the best value for money. They are on the look-out for the best prices, promotions and deals. The sharp rises in fuel prices across the world coupled with pressure on disposable income has amplified a shift to smaller, more frequent, convenience shopping missions. In the UK, the proportion of customers shopping three or more times a week for food and groceries is up from 29% in 2009 to 49% in 2013. Health and wellbeing is also a growing trend. Over half of the UK population worry about their health and food is at the centre. Quality fresh food and provenance are priorities for customers across our regions. In Europe and the UK, interest in and awareness of provenance have intensified since the meat contamination issues last year. In Asia wet-markets continue to be a popular choice for fresh meat, fish and poultry.

Our key enablers make us unique and help us to continually do these things better. com businessmodel to watch a short animation explaining how our business model works 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Business model The key enablers T As a retailer, our business model is based on four core activities. Using our unrivalled insight to understand what customers want, we buy products and services from suppliers, move them through our distribution network and sell them to customers. Most importantly, our core purpose is at the heart of these activities. It is by improving these activities for customers each time they shop with us that we make what matters better, together. Across the Group, our customers visit us in store, online, or through a combination of different formats and channels. They come to buy their groceries, clothing, general merchandise and services such as telecoms, digital entertainment and banking. We are focused on providing customers with the most compelling offer and the best shopping trip. We work with our suppliers to offer an excellent range of products and services. We move the products through our modern and efficient supply chain into our well-located, multi-format store network, ready for customers to shop with us 24 hours a day. The core activities form a cycle. T o keep customers coming back, we are constantly strengthening our operation. We listen to customers in a number of ways, including through our monthly Customer Viewpoint surveys in UK stores, in-depth focus groups with our T esco Families and dedicated Customer Question Time sessions. Combining this feedback with our data, including the unique insight we gain from Clubcard, and acting on it is crucial to our success. Our seven key enablers are our business strengths. They help us to sustain and improve our core activities. These elements are what make us different and it's because of these that we are uniquely placed to win. For example, establishing multichannel leadership and building a seamless offer will enable customers to shop however, whenever and wherever they want, which will mean that we stand out for customers. Another example is leveraging our Group skill and scale, which is all about sharing our experiences across our operations. We trial in one area of the business and transfer the learnings to another, whether it's sharing the loyalty scheme blueprint internationally or building capital-efficient grocery home shopping businesses in new markets. Being able to leverage our Group skill and scale makes us unique and helps us to perform the core activities even better. The momentum of our business model comes from the virtuous circle. By developing economies of scale and investing in an ever-improving customer offer, we drive loyalty and grow sales. Developing and using economies of scale across our business all over the world, enables us to improve the customer offer by investing in areas such as price, range, quality and service. This year, for example, we completed the roll-out of grocery home shopping to all of our markets except India. It is a service we developed in the UK and have rolled out in a capital-efficient way to our international businesses, with a great customer response. Doing the right thing for customers is central to the business model. It's why one of our Values is 'no-one tries harder for customers': we know that if we do the right thing for customers, they will reward us with their loyalty. The more pleased customers are with the shopping trip, the more loyal they will be and the more we will grow our sales. This combination of scale and growth is the driving force of the business model. 38 million Clubcard customers shopping in our 7,300 stores across the Group give us unrivalled insight into consumer habits, trends and preferences. 59.7% of our UK customers shop across two or more channels, including stores and online. 12 markets with retail operations delivering 85 million customer shopping trips each week.

From an accounting point of view, our existing business in China has to be treated as a discontinued operation, prior to the planned completion of our partnership with CRE. The pro-forma Group ROCE of 12.1% includes our Chinese business to provide a comparable figure to the previously disclosed 2012 13 figure. It is otherwise calculated on a continuing operations basis, excluding one-off charges. Excluding our Chinese business, Group ROCE for 2013 14 was 13.6%. Group results and strategic update Group sales for the year were PS70.9 billion, an increase of 0.3% at actual exchange rates. Full-year trading profit for our continuing operations declined 6.0 % to PS3.3 billion. This was driven by a decline in UK profits and challenges overseas: specifically, the regulatory impact in South Korea, political disruption in Thailand and continuing challenging conditions in Central Europe. Underlying profit before tax 1, which excludes the contribution from property-related items, declined 6.9 % to PS3.1 billion. Underlying diluted earnings per share was 32.05 pence. During the year, we concluded our strategic review in the United States with the sale of the substantive part of Fresh & Easy's operating business to Yucaipa. We also announced our partnership with China Resources Enterprise Ltd. CRE, which when completed will give T esco a 20% ownership stake in the largest food retail business in China. Both of those operations are therefore shown as discontinued. Reflecting the challenging trading conditions and rapidly changing environments, we have also announced a number of one-off charges. PS 801 million 2 of these are in continuing operations. These include: A non-cash impairment of PS 734 million to the carrying values of some stores in the Europe segment. An additional PS 63 million provision for payment protection insurance and other customer redress at the Bank. Our statutory profit before tax for the year was PS2.3 billion. Despite these charges and a lower contribution from profits and losses on property-related items, Group profit before tax increased by 9.8%, primarily reflecting higher one-off charges last year.

This prudently reflects the lower end of a range of independent valuations of the proposed combination carried out in the second half of the year for accounting purposes. These valuations were, as required by the relevant accounting standards, produced on a standalone existing basis for each business. As such, they do not take account of the strategic value and significant synergies available once the businesses are merged. Segmental results UK Full-year sales in the UK declined by 0.1 % and grew by 0.8% excluding petrol. Like-for-like sales declined by 1.3 % including VAT and excluding petrol. This reflects the weaker grocery market, lower inflation across the industry, a continuing drag from our large stores and the work to transform our general merchandise.

We expect it to be lower again next year. Our full-year trading margin was 5.03%, a reduction of 18 basis points. Trading margin in the first half increased by 2 basis points, but declined by 28 basis points in the second half. This is reflective of our trading performance and our determination to improve and strengthen the customer offer. Asia Although we have strong high-returning businesses in Asia with leading market positions, their performance this year reflects a number of challenges. Sales grew by 1.4% at constant rates, including a 5.9% contribution from new stores as we continue to invest in these growth markets. Like-for-like sales declined by 4.5 % and our trading margin declined by almost 60 basis points to 6.71%.

China, with our subsidiary there now treated as a discontinued operation following our agreement to partner with CRE. Although we have annualised the introduction of the DIDA opening hours regulations in South Korea, year-on-year changes in the days and hours of the closures have continued to impact sales. We have worked hard to mitigate the residual effects of the regulation by fully aligning our operations to the current pattern of trading. In Thailand, our performance has been held back by our own execution as well as external pressures. We implemented a strong plan, including steps to address some parts of our offer which underperformed in the first half. This included the remerchandising and remarketing of our 'Clubpack' range of bulk buy products, a particularly important category for small traders who shop with us. The Thai economy also fell into recession during the year and this has since been compounded by the recent political unrest. The full-year numbers for Asia benefited from currency, but in the fourth quarter we saw a negative impact, driven by the Thai Baht. Whilst it is difficult to predict currency movements going forward, this impact has continued into the new financial year. South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand remain markets in which we see significant future potential and opportunities to invest in high-returning stores. We have opened 2.1 million square feet of new space in these markets this year, a reduction compared to the 2.3 million we opened last year. In the coming year we intend to be even more focused with plans to open 1.2 million square feet, with much of it in convenience. Europe Conditions in Europe have remained challenging this year, particularly for our large stores. Sales declined 2.0 % at constant rates. Like-forlike sales declined by 3.5 % excluding petrol. Our trading profit for the region declined by 27.7 % at actual exchange rates to PS238 million, resulting in a 2.57% trading margin. Our decision to invest in the shopping trip through price, quality, range and service resulted in a stronger second half performance. The region's like-for-like sales have improved through the year, from 5.5 % in the first quarter to 0.6 % in the fourth quarter. Reflecting the year-on-year decline in the profits of our European businesses, we revised our long-term budgets. These revisions have resulted in the asset impairment of PS 734 million to the carrying value of these businesses.

Ireland has continued to be a difficult market this year with severe pressure on consumer spending, strong competition from the discounters and aggressive couponing activity. Although the launch of Price Promise in the second half has helped improve customer trust in our prices, and we have been working hard to show customers the breadth and points of difference in our offer, our weaker trading performance in this market has impacted on the profitability of our European segment. We have continued to focus on the heartland of our business in T urkey and the stores there have contributed to a gradual improvement in like-for-like sales over the year. Nevertheless, addressing our position in T urkey is very much a priority. We continue to be very disciplined in our allocation of capital to Europe. We have reduced capital expenditure in the region by nearly 40% this year, and expect to maintain a similar or lower level of spend in 2014 15. Going forward, new investment will be scarce and focused only on targeted opportunities, primarily in convenience and online. Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 13 We are spending significantly less on new space. In the UK we have already reduced our investment from 2.5 million square feet at peak. In the coming year, we will open just 0.9 million square feet of net new space. This includes almost 200,000 square feet of franchise space in One Stop. In Europe, we will open just 275,000 square feet of net new space and focus more of our investment on high-returning opportunities in Asia. Property The market value of our property across the Group currently exceeds PS34 billion, with the most significant driver of the reduction since last year being the impact of foreign exchange rates. Historically, by acquiring and developing high-quality stores we grew the value of our property significantly and unrealised property profits built up. We have had an active programme of releasing value from our property portfolio over many years. We continue to look at our property portfolio in order to maximise value in the most appropriate way for the business as a whole. Excluding one-off items, profits arising from property-related items declined to PS180 million this year, in line with the reduction of our sale and leaseback programme outlined last year. This year we have focused on South Korea and we completed a sale-and-leaseback in January comprising four Homeplus stores and accompanying mall space. Pension Our pension is an extremely valuable benefit for colleagues and one we are proud to offer. IFRS accounting gives a marked-tomarket measure of our pension liabilities, based on market conditions which of course can be volatile in the short term, whereas the liabilities are clearly long-term in nature. Our after-tax IAS 19 pension deficit this year has risen to PS2.6 billion, mainly due to a reduction in real corporate bond yields with a subsequent fall in the discount rate used to measure our liabilities. A triennial actuarial valuation will be carried out to measure our liabilities as at 31 March 2014 and this will be completed in 2015. Return on capital employed When we complete our partnership with CRE, our Group return on capital employed will reflect our share of the partnership's assets and profits or losses. Given that we expect to complete the partnership in the first half of 2014 15 we have given a pro-forma Group ROCE including our Chinese business. On this basis, our Group ROCE was 12.1%, which is a comparable figure to the 12.7% we reported last year. Excluding our Chinese business based on its current accounting treatment as a discontinued operation, our Group ROCE would be 13.6%. The UK continues to earn the highest returns in the Group and our businesses in Asia are high-returning. Europe's returns remain below cost of capital. We will continue to limit capital expenditure in this region and focus our efforts on improving our offer for customers in existing stores. Tesco Bank Tesco Bank generated PS194 million trading profit this year. Excluding income from the legacy insurance distribution agreement which terminated in 2012 13 and fair value releases resulting from the unwind of an acquisition accounting adjustment, it grew by 19%. We have seen good growth in our core banking products with customer accounts for credit cards, loans, mortgages and savings up 14%. After the first full year of trading, mortgage balances have grown to PS0.7 billion and we have helped over 4,000 customers to own their homes. Those customers have borrowed an average of just under PS170,000 with a loan-to-value ratio of just over 50%. Reflecting the challenging market conditions, with increased competition driving a marked reduction in premiums across the industry, the profit contribution of our Insurance business was down 17 % this year excluding legacy income. Tesco Bank results PSm % growth Tesco Bank revenue exc. impact of IFRIC 13 PS1,003m 1.8 % Tesco Bank trading profit PS194m 1.6% Tesco Bank trading margin trading profit revenue 19.34% 63bp The Bank will soon complete its suite of products with a current account launching in the first half. We expect the growth in underlying trading profit in 2014 15 to be broadly offset by the investment in current accounts. Within one-off items, the Bank has made a further increase to the provision for payment protection insurance of PS 20 million and a provision of PS 43 million for other customer redress. The Bank's balance sheet remains strong with good levels of liquidity. Although customer deposits remain the primary source of funding, the funding base was diversified during the year with a credit card securitisation and participation in the Funding for Lending scheme. Group balance sheet and cash flow Net debt has remained stable year-on-year at PS6.6 billion. In the context of declining underlying profit, lower property proceeds and a maintained dividend, this demonstrates our discipline and focus on cash. Two metrics that we use to guide our internal decisions and which support our discipline to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating are net indebtedness and fixed charge cover. This year net indebtedness rose slightly to 3.16 times and fixed charge cover remained stable at 3.4 times. This year we spent PS2.7 billion of capex, or PS3.0 billion including China. We are reducing our capital expenditure to no more than PS2.5 billion for at least the next three years. A greater proportion of this reduced overall spend is devoted to our existing stores. We are accelerating our refresh programme in the UK and we are also maintaining our level of spend on technology to ensure that we have the necessary capabilities for a truly multichannel offer. 14 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Financial review continued After 14 years' service at Tesco, Laurie resigned as Chief Financial Officer on 4 April 2014. Our approach to growth and returns We laid out this financial framework in April 2013 and it continues to inform our decisions. The framework helps ensure an appropriate balance of growth, returns and cash generation, and outlines what shareholders can expect from T esco from a financial perspective in the medium term. The changes we have announced to capital expenditure underpin our commitment to this framework. This moves capital expenditure to the bottom of our 4% down to 3.5% of sales guiderail. This even greater focus on capital discipline will help maintain the commitment to generate positive free cash flow, maintain a strong balance sheet, and continue to maintain a strong dividend. I wish Philip and the team well and am absolutely confident that T esco will emerge from this period of unprecedented change in the industry stronger than ever.

We know that customers who shop across channels spend more with us and this measure tracks whether they are shopping between different sized stores, grocery online and services. Definition: Percentage of loyal customers who in the last 13 weeks have bought held products from Bank, T elecoms, Clothing Commentary: Our multichannel, multibrand strategy is founded in the belief that the whole is more than the sum of the parts. This measure tracks whether we are building loyalty and value across our brands and channels. Loved by customers Our final measure is one of customer advocacy. Whilst the first four are functional measures, we know that for our brand to be loved, liked or actively chosen, our emotional connection with our customers must get stronger. Emotionally loyal customers, advocates and fans become brilliant ambassadors and drive word of mouth, as well as engaging more broadly and deeply with the business. There are many different ways of measuring advocacy, not least using a net promoter score, but they all add up to something similar - do customers like you enough to recommend you to others? With our strategy now focused on delivering even greater loyalty from our customers, we place even greater emphasis across the business on improving five customer-focused key performance indicators. Whilst we continue to track a range of financial and non-financial measures, it is these five which each of our businesses now uses to gauge progress. Key performance indicators of our strategic performance We have entered the new, multichannel world of retail and customers' expectations have changed. Customers have increased access to more and more retailers simply at their search bar on their smartphone and our success will be a result of more customers choosing T esco in preference to others. As a result of this fundamental change, we have prioritised our customer-focused measures to track and communicate our progress against the strategy. We believe these five KPIs are more relevant today, during this time of transition and transformation, than some of our historical and short-term measures. Everything we are doing to create the most compelling offer is designed to retain our most loyal customers, attract new ones and allow them to shop however, whenever and wherever they want to. These measures both allow us to monitor our progress and to create value because they are entirely focused on customers and how they choose to shop. Greater loyalty delivers greater lifetime value so we are tracking the behaviours of our loyal Clubcard customers - those who are most engaged and typically spend more with us. Focusing on our loyal customers is how we are driving the transformation we are going through and is how we will build enduring like-for-like sales. The measures contained in this section are for our core UK business where they are particularly relevant. They do however apply to every part of our business - whether it's a store, a category, a country or a department - and we are using them across the Group to drive the behaviours that we believe will lead to long-term success. Loyal customers are defined based on their frequency of spend and average weekly spend. Channels include: large stores, convenience stores, grocery home shopping, T esco Direct and Wine by the case. Current results do not include Blinkbox, Clothing online, Nutricentre, Dobbies and our new coffee shops and restaurants. These will be tracked going forward. 16 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Key performance indicators Times 6 4 2 12 13 11 12 10 11 09 10 08 09 13 14 11 12 09 10 05 06 07 08 03 04 13 14 % 8 6 4 2 12 13 13 14 12.7% 12.1% Times 4 3 2 1 12 13 11 12 10 11 09 10 08 09 13 14 Group performance Group financial ratios Measures of current financial performance Growth in underlying profit before tax 6.9 % Return on capital employed 'ROCE' 12.1% Growth in underlying diluted earnings per share at a constant tax rate 7.3 % 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 14 10.8% 2.6% 14.4 % 7.3 % 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 14 12.3% 2.1% 14.9 % 6.9 % Performance Our underlying profit performance this year reflects weaker market conditions in the UK, difficult trading conditions in Europe, the impact of opening hours regulations in South Korea and a weak economy in Thailand.

We are committed to building longer-term strong strategic relationships, and our teams are very focused on improving this score. Performance We have donated almost PS53 million to charities and good causes this year through direct donations, cause-related marketing, gifts in kind, colleague time and management costs. This represents 2.3% of our statutory profit before tax. The total that we have donated is lower this year, largely due to the transition from T esco for Schools and Clubs to our Eat Happy initiative.

PS53m down PS13m from 2013 Colleague retention 90% in the UK down 1% from 2013 Performance Colleague retention in the UK continues to be very strong. This reflects our determination to make T esco a great place to work, with excellent benefits and career development opportunities. 6.2% across the Group 0.7% from 2013 67% down 4% from 2013 Performance Training and development is really important to us. This measure is the percentage of colleagues participating in our development programmes. As our learning and development programmes have matured we now include a broad portfolio in our measure: 'Options', Advanced Leadership and Group Leadership Programmes as well as our Apprenticeship, Graduate, Operations and Commercial Programmes. In 2012 13 this figure excluding China was 5.5%. Colleagues being trained for their next role Our strategic priorities Using our scale for good In addition to the discussion around employee, environmental, community and social issues embedded in this Strategic Report, you can find a great deal more information in our T esco and Society Report www. com society about how we are starting to tackle three urgent issues facing society - food waste, improving health and youth unemployment. It also shows how we are strengthening our work in the four essential areas - trading responsibly, reducing our impact on the environment, being a great employer and supporting local communities - which are fundamental to the way we do business. 18 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Key performance indicators continued GHG emissions data for period 24 February 2013 to 22 February 2014 Greenhouse gas 'GHG' emission reporting This year our carbon footprint was 6.37 million tonnes of CO 2 e.

We have a responsibility to respect the human rights of our colleagues, our customers, the communities we operate in and the people who work throughout our supply chain. Our approach We are committed to upholding basic human rights and support in full the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization Core Conventions. We were a founding member of the Ethical Trading Initiative and expect all our suppliers to work towards fully implementing the base code. We investigate allegations of human rights infringements and take appropriate action where necessary. T o review our policy visit www. In addressing human rights we consider our potential impacts on the following groups as a priority: Our colleagues: Our people policies are designed to make Tesco a great place to work where everyone is welcome Our supply chain: Building strong partnerships with trusted suppliers will ensure that we deliver high-quality and safe products that are responsibly produced Our customers and the communities in which we operate: Our customers want to buy high-quality products that are produced safely and responsibly. We want to be a good neighbour wherever we operate. Through our scale for good strategy we are addressing some of the key challenges that societies are facing which are closely aligned to specific human rights as defined by the UN. For example: Right to education - we are working to provide opportunities for millions of young people Right to be free from hunger - we are building close relationships with food banks and food surplus charities who are helping to feed people in need Right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health - we are helping our colleagues and customers to lead healthier lives. The complexity of addressing human rights risks and concerns should not be underestimated. We believe that openness and responsiveness are essential in the identification and remedy of issues. We also understand we can not always address issues alone and so are committed to working in partnership with relevant stakeholders to make improvements. Governance and monitoring Our governance committees consider financial and non-financial risks to our business and the Compliance and Social Responsibility Committees in particular consider risks related to our Human Rights Policy, which are maintained on our company risk register. Key elements of our Human Rights Policy are incorporated into our Code of Business Conduct which is reviewed by our senior managers once a year. Our established 'protector line' is primarily used by colleagues and contractors to report suspected breaches of our Code of Business Conduct or internal company policies. Next year we are launching an independent 'protector line' service for use by any of our suppliers. Their employees will be able to raise confidentially concerns of wrongdoing in the provision of either goods or services for or on behalf of T esco. Issues will be recorded, investigated and where necessary action will be taken. Improvement In 2013, we commissioned  to carry out an analysis of our Human Rights Policy. Based on these findings we are revising our policy. This includes putting more emphasis on our human rights responsibilities in a revised Code of Business Conduct. Diversity We approach diversity in its broadest sense, recognising that successful world-class businesses flourish through embracing intellectual, experiential, geographical and skills diversity as well as other factors such as age, disability, gender, race and sexual orientation. The ratio of male to female colleagues, based on the number of employees at year end, is outlined below: Male Female Board of Directors 8 73% 3 27% Senior managers - Directors 667 78% 193 22% Senior managers - Directors and managers 3,994 70% 1,739 30% All employees 216,763 43% 288,781 57% Senior roles are demanding for all - regardless of gender - and we are determined to develop a culture and environment where people can advance. We introduced a 'Women in Leadership' development programme in 2011 and so far a total of 440 female colleagues have completed or are currently on the programme. Greenhouse gas emissions We have calculated our carbon footprint according to the WRI WBCSD Greenhouse Gas 'GHG' Protocol. We follow the operational control approach and use emission factors from Defra DECC's GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2013. For more information on our carbon targets and how we calculate our carbon footprint, including reporting standards, the definition of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, and ERM CVS's Independent Assurance Statement, see www. Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 19 Other statutory disclosures A key challenge for any business is to identify the principal risks it faces and to develop and monitor appropriate controls. A successful risk management process balances risks and rewards and relies on sound judgement of their likelihood and impact. The Group maintains a Key Risk Register of the principal risks faced by the Group, including the likelihood and impact of risks and the controls and procedures implemented to mitigate them. Our process for identifying and managing risks is set out in more detail on page 40 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014. The table below sets out the principal risks faced by the Group, and examples of relevant key controls and mitigating factors. The Board considers these to be the most significant risks faced by the Group. They do not comprise all the risks associated with the Group and they are not set out in any order of priority. Additional risks not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse effect on the business. As customers' disposable income remains stretched, the competitive intensity of the retail marketplace also continues to grow. It is against this backdrop that there has been a trend towards increasing net risk during the year. Whilst the economic situation in our principal market, the UK, is beginning to show some improvement, there are increased levels of economic, political and regulatory volatility in the wider global marketplace which have increased the assessed level of net risk that the business faces in these areas. The ongoing austerity programmes in Asia and Europe and the fiscal and regulatory measures that apply to the retail sector, for example the DIDA Act in South Korea, have continued to challenge the business. An increase in the rating of economic, political and regulatory risks since last year is principally driven by a revised view of the likely impact of these risks on the business, particularly in the context of the global marketplace and the financial and trading position of the Group. The ongoing delivery of our multichannel vision, combined with a growing focus on customer data, has also heightened our sensitivity to the impact of technology risks. The impact assessment of technology has therefore increased and this remains a key area of focus. Significant efforts by management to mitigate risks and strengthen controls have reduced the assessment of the likelihood of certain risks occurring. Notable examples include: product safety and ethical trading, reputation and property. Changes to the Group's property strategy in the year have also reduced the overall property net risk rating. Principal risks Key controls and mitigating factors Business strategy If our strategy follows the wrong direction or is not effectively communicated or implemented, the business may suffer The retail industry is undergoing a transformational change in this digital age. The challenge is in balancing investment and the emphasis between traditional and new Investor support may be impacted if it takes longer than expected to demonstrate that our strategy is the right one, or if we cannot make the investments required An unclear or unsuccessful strategy against the growth of budget retailers could adversely impact our market share and profitability Our ability to operate successfully in international markets may be restricted if we do not follow the right strategy in each market, which in turn could adversely impact the Group's profitability Strategic matters are regularly reviewed by the Board and Executive Committee: the Board dedicates two full days a year to testing and challenging Group strategy Our plan is clear and focused on our three priorities: a strong UK business: multichannel leadership: and disciplined international growth A disciplined approach is taken with underperforming assets and decisive action is taken on strategy as appropriate, including the recent decisions regarding operations in the US, China and India. See the Chairman's statement and the Report from the Chief Executive on pages 1 to 7 for more details We continue to invest in the customer offer through initiatives such as Price Promise, which aim to improve customer perception of our relative price position The structure of our executive sub-committees is designed to focus on key risks through the work of the Group Commercial, Compliance, Multichannel, T echnology, People Matters Group, Property Strategy and Social Responsibility Committees Significant resource is invested to communicate strategy effectively to those delivering it Consistent operational plans are developed throughout the Group to ensure delivery A Steering Wheel balanced scorecard system helps to monitor delivery Structured stakeholder engagement programmes are conducted: an investor and analyst seminar was hosted in February 2014 to reiterate our strategic priorities Financial strategy Risks relate to an incorrect or unclear financial strategy and the failure to achieve financial plans There are risks that our financial guiderails will not be achieved, or if achieving them means that the business is stretched in the short-term at the expense of investment in our long-term strategy Weak performance could put pressure on free cash flow and credit metrics and affect our credit rating Financial strategy risks and performance are regularly reviewed by the Board and Executive Committee, with external advice obtained as required We have set clear expectations for the market with our financial disciplines and guiderails: improving capital discipline: greater focus on balancing growth with returns: and being more focused on cash rather than margins. See the Financial review on pages 12 to 15 for more details The Balance Sheet Committee regularly reviews gearing and net debt management Consistent operational plans and budgets are developed throughout the Group to help drive delivery A Steering Wheel balanced scorecard system helps to monitor delivery Structured stakeholder engagement programmes are conducted so that expectations are clear 20 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Principal risks and uncertainties Principal risks Key controls and mitigating factors Competition and consolidation Failure to compete on areas including price, product range, quality and multichannel service in increasingly competitive UK and overseas retail markets could impact our market share and adversely affect the Group's financial results New entrants to the market and the consolidation of competitors through mergers or trade agreements in key markets or geographical areas could adversely impact our market share Our strategy to have broad appeal on price, range and format and to take the lead as a multichannel business, allows us to compete in different markets A more diversified portfolio, such as our new food experience investments in Giraffe, Harris and Hoole and Euphorium, allows us to take advantage of new retailing opportunities Our Executive and Multichannel Committees and Trading Groups regularly review markets, trading opportunities and competitor activities, including discounter growth, convenience and online activities We continue to innovate and invest in online and multichannel activities, including our grocery, clothing and general merchandise offerings in the UK and internationally Increased global marketing efforts aim to maximise the impact of our brand and intellectual property Performance is tracked against relevant KPIs and measures that customers tell us are critical to their shopping experience Customer perceptions of T esco and competitors are constantly monitored to allow us to respond quickly and appropriately Reputational risk Failure to protect the Group's reputation and brand in the face of ethical, legal, moral or operational challenges could lead to a loss of trust and confidence and a decline in customer base, and also affect our ability to recruit and retain good people If we do not make positive contributions to society and effectively communicate these, this may adversely impact our ability to win and retain customer trust and loyalty T esco Values are at the heart of how we do business to help us to consistently and transparently do the right thing for customers, colleagues and society as a whole Through our newest Value - 'we use our scale for good' - we are tackling some of the most important issues for society: creating opportunities for young people, improving health, and reducing food waste. These ambitions build on the essential work we do every day as a responsible business: trading responsibly, reducing our impact on the environment, being a great employer and supporting local communities We have established an external advisory panel of experts to challenge and help shape the strategic direction of this important work. See our T esco and Society Report 2014 for more details Communication and engagement programmes help us to understand stakeholder views and reflect them in our strategy and policies Building strong relationships with our trading partners suppliers allows us to recognise and anticipate changes in our industry so we can continue to provide quality, affordable products at a great price and which are sourced responsibly Our embedded Group Code of Business Conduct, Bribery Act and UK Groceries Supply Code of Practice guidelines guide our behaviour in dealing with customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders Comprehensive and improved supplier auditing and product surveillance programmes are in place to minimise the risks associated with product integrity and labour standards Governance committees, including the Executive, Corporate Responsibility, Group Commercial, Social Responsibility, Compliance, Multichannel and T echnology Committees, guide and monitor policies Performance If business units including the UK underperform against plan and against competitors, our business may fail to meet the stated strategy in full and impairment of asset values may result The delivery of long-term goals and sustainable performance may be impaired if the business focuses too heavily on short-term targets Our Board, Executive Committee and various operational committees, including the UK Operating Board, meet regularly to review performance risks All business units have stretching targets based on a Steering Wheel balanced scorecard system: performance against budgets and KPIs are monitored continually and reported regularly to the Board Clear budgets, goals and objectives are set for subsidiary CEOs, with a high proportion of reward based on the achievement of stretching targets Our diversification strategy minimises the impact of changes in the economic climate The regional alignment of shared opportunities leverages skill and scale to maximise performance Clear and regular communications ensure that colleagues have confidence and belief in our long-term strategy and perform at their best without undue focus on short-term performance targets Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 21 Principal risks Key controls and mitigating factors Property The acquisition, development and management of property sites carry inherent risk. Challenges may arise in relation to obtaining planning or other consents: compliance with varying country safety, design and construction standards: tenant management: and maintaining a cost-effective estate with the right balance of freehold and leasehold sites Calling an end to the 'space race' and our change of strategy in markets such as China has reduced property acquisition and development risk. There is now greater focus on repurposing space and managing our freehold and leasehold balance wisely and profitably Group Property Strategy, Property Acquisition and related committees regularly review, and closely control, property acquisition, planning, construction and repurposing processes to ensure standards are met and risks are minimised Group Property Blueprints are adopted to ensure consistency of approach Group and country Compliance Committees monitor legal and regulatory compliance in property activities Mall management systems are in place to assist site management Economic In each country where we operate, we are impacted by the underlying economic environment, the impact of austerity programmes on consumer spending and the fiscal measures that apply to the retail sector The external economic outlook is carefully considered when developing strategy and is continuously monitored through the Executive Committee's review of performance Country developments are continuously monitored through local CEOs A central Euro Disaster Committee monitors developments in the Eurozone We try to anticipate and contribute to important changes in public policy wherever we operate Political and regulatory In each country where we operate, we may be impacted by legal and regulatory changes, increased scrutiny by competition authorities and political developments relevant to domestic trade and the retail sector The regulatory landscape is becoming more restrictive in many markets, which may impact how we trade.

Further explanation of these risks is set out in Note 22 on page 104 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014. An overview of the management of these risks is set out below for ease of reference and to support a further understanding of the principal treasury risks described in the table above. Details of the main financial risks relating to T esco Bank and the management of those risks can be found in Note 22 on page 107 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014. Financial risks Key controls and mitigating factors Funding and liquidity risk The risk of being unable to continue to fund our operations on an ongoing basis The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, disposals of property assets, debt capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases New funding of PS1.4 billion was raised during the year, including PS0.8 billion from long term debt and PS0.6 billion from property disposals. At the year end, net debt was PS6.6 billion 2013: PS6.6 billion The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities and a strong credit rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. At the year end, the Group had a long-term credit rating of BBB negative from Fitch, Baa1 negative from Moody's and BBB stable from Standard & Poor's Interest rate risk The risk to our profit and loss account resulting from rising interest rates Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and floors may be used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt Our policy is to fix interest rates for the year on a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs of the Group excluding T esco Bank. At the year end, the percentage of interest-bearing debt at fixed rates was 84% 2013: 75%. The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate form. The average rate of interest paid on an historic cost basis this year, excluding joint ventures and associates, was 4.5% 2013: 4.8% Foreign exchange risk The risk that exchange rate volatility may have an adverse impact on our balance sheet or profit and loss account T ransactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are managed, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies and purchased currency options. At the year end, forward foreign currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to PS2,862 million were outstanding 2013: PS1,835 million as detailed in Note 21 on page 99 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014. We translate overseas profits at average foreign exchange rates We only hedge a proportion of the investment in our international subsidiaries as well as ensuring that each subsidiary is appropriately hedged in respect of its non-functional currency assets. During the year, currency movements decreased the net value, after the effects of hedging, of the Group's overseas assets by PS1,102 million last year increase of PS420 million Credit risk The risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions The Group holds positions with an approved list of counter parties of good credit quality and these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored Insurance risk The risk of being inadequately protected from liabilities arising from unforeseen events We purchased assets, earnings and combined liability protection from the open insurance market for higher value losses only The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the business with some cover being provided by our captive insurance companies, ELH Insurance Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the Republic of Ireland.

However, the sharp decline and large negative **ROE** strongly suggest the company is underperforming relative to typical industry standards, which generally do not exhibit such negative returns.\n\n- **Is growth persistent or temporary?**  \n  The negative **ROE** is primarily driven by one-off charges of **\u00a37.0bn**, restructuring costs, asset impairments, and operational challenges described in the report. While some of these are temporary, the underlying operational issues and market challenges indicate that the negative performance may persist in the short term. Positive signs include early improvements in UK like-for-like sales and focus on customer service, which could support a gradual recovery.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- Expected **ROE** next year is likely to remain negative or low positive in the short term due to ongoing restructuring, balance sheet deleveraging, and market challenges, but may improve gradually as the company\u2019s strategic priorities take effect.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- **The company\u2019s ROE has sharply declined to a significant negative figure (-0.8119), reflecting severe financial stress and poor shareholder value creation in the current year.**  \n- **This decline is largely due to large one-off charges, impairments, and operational inefficiencies, as outlined in the report, impacting profitability and equity returns.**  \n- **Although the report highlights initiatives to regain competitiveness, rebuild trust, and strengthen the balance sheet, these are early-stage and the turnaround will take time.**  \n- **The negative ROE contrasts with a previous positive but low ROE, indicating a sudden and material deterioration rather than a gradual decline.**  \n- **The company\u2019s liquidity and capital expenditure reductions, alongside store closures and portfolio reviews, are efforts to protect financial stability but also reflect ongoing challenges.**  \n- **Early signs of improved like-for-like sales volumes and customer focus are promising but insufficient to offset the current negative returns.**  \n- **Risks remain significant due to market competition, regulatory investigations, consumer trust erosion, and required cultural and structural changes.**  \n- **The management team\u2019s renewed focus on governance, transparency, and customer experience is critical to reversing the ROE trend over the medium term.**  \n- **Financial discipline and reinvestment in the customer offer are key strategic pillars to support future profitability and shareholder returns.**  \n- **Overall, the ROE analysis underscores a company in transition with significant challenges but a clear strategy aimed at long-term recovery.**",
        "Detailed Analysis of ROE Drivers": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?**  \n  The growth in ROE appears to be driven primarily by an increase in **Assets Turnover** from **4.08** to **5.21**, indicating improved efficiency in utilizing assets. However, the **Profit Margin** has deteriorated significantly from a positive **1.53%** to a negative **-9.22%**, signaling a decline in profitability. This suggests ROE growth is being driven solely by efficiency improvements, while margin performance is weak, which is only a partial positive sign.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  The provided textual report highlights significant challenges including a statutory loss before tax of **\u00a36.4bn**, a steep decline in UK trading profit, and aggressive restructuring efforts. The negative profit margin of **-9.22%** reflects these difficulties and is likely below industry averages and competitors. Despite strong asset turnover, the poor margin indicates the company is underperforming on profitability relative to the industry.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year:** Given ongoing restructuring and focus on operational efficiency, **Asset Turnover** is expected to remain stable or increase slightly, around **5.3**.  \n- **Expected Profit Margin next year:** With the company\u2019s focus on rebuilding competitiveness and reinvesting savings into customer offers, **Profit Margin** is forecasted to improve but likely remain negative or low positive in the short term, around **-3% to 0%**, as recovery efforts take time.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The company\u2019s **ROE** dynamics are currently driven more by **asset efficiency** gains (**Asset Turnover** up from **4.08** to **5.21**) rather than by profitability improvements, which are currently weak and negative (**Profit Margin** down from **1.53%** to **-9.22%**).  \n- The negative profit margin reflects deep operational and market challenges described in the report, including restructuring costs, impairments, and a tough competitive landscape, indicating that margin remains the weaker driver.  \n- Forecasts suggest **Asset Turnover** will continue to be a strength, while **Profit Margin** is expected to recover gradually but remain subdued in the near term, making margin improvement the critical factor for sustainable ROE growth.",

However, **NLP legal risk** and **NLP tax risk** have declined from **0.76** to **0.61** and **0.6** to **0.56**, respectively, suggesting improvements or reduced concerns in these areas.\n\n- **Is the number and severity of risks higher than competitors/industry?**  \n  While the report highlights significant risks, including the Serious Fraud Office investigation and financial challenges, the company appears transparent in risk disclosures. The severity of **financial risks** is elevated, especially with the high **gearing ratio** (4.31), which is considerably above the previous year (2.09), indicating higher leverage than typical industry norms.\n\n- **Is sentiment increasing or declining?**  \n  Sentiment, as inferred from the **NLP legal and tax risk scores**, is improving (declining risk scores), reflecting more positive or less negative language around these risk areas. The textual tone acknowledges challenges but also emphasizes proactive management and governance improvements.\n\n- **Is specificity increasing or declining?**  \n  **NLP specificity** has marginally increased from **0.0709** to **0.0720**, indicating slightly more detailed and precise disclosure of risks in the current year compared to the previous year.\n\n- **Are complexity measures increasing or declining?**  \n  **NLP sentence length** has slightly decreased from **31.11** to **30.66**, while **sentence depth** increased from **6.43** to **6.51**, showing marginally more complex sentence structures but somewhat shorter sentences. Overall, complexity remains stable with a slight tendency toward deeper, more nuanced explanations.\n\n- **How are sentiment, specificity, and complexity compared to competitors?**  \n  Although no direct competitor data is provided, the firm\u2019s detailed risk disclosures and moderate complexity suggest a transparent and comprehensive approach relative to typical industry standards. The improving legal and tax sentiments further support a positive stance compared to peers facing similar challenges.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Is Gearing expected to increase next year?**  \n  Given the current high gearing ratio (**4.31**) and management\u2019s focus on protecting and strengthening the balance sheet, **gearing is expected to decrease or stabilize rather than increase** next year.\n\n- **Is Current Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The current ratio has declined from **0.73** to **0.60**, reflecting liquidity pressure. With ongoing restructuring and cost-saving initiatives, **a moderate increase in the current ratio is likely** next year as liquidity improves.\n\n- **Is Quick Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The quick ratio remains very low (**0.15**), indicating tight short-term liquidity excluding inventories. Similar to the current ratio, **a slight improvement is expected** as the company enhances cash flow management.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The company faces **increased financial risk** as reflected by the higher gearing and rising NLP financial risk score, but **legal and tax risks have declined**, showing improved sentiment in these areas.  \n- **Risk disclosures are becoming slightly more specific and detailed**, with stable complexity suggesting transparent and nuanced communication of principal risks.  \n- Liquidity ratios (**current and quick ratios**) have decreased, indicating short-term liquidity challenges, but management\u2019s strategic focus on balance sheet strengthening and cost control should improve these metrics.  \n- Despite significant challenges and regulatory scrutiny, the company shows a **commitment to rebuild trust and transparency**, which is positive for long-term risk management.  \n- Overall, the firm\u2019s risk profile is mixed; **financial leverage and liquidity pressures remain concerns**, but efforts to address them and the improving legal and tax risk outlook show progress.",

This is reflected in the financial results contained in this report. As Chairman, my primary duty is to shareholders, and I believe the best way to deliver shareholder value is to regain our absolute focus on customers and on improving the shopping trip. A key priority for me will be to ensure that the governance of the business is as it should be. Our shareholders expect their company to be run in a responsible, sustainable and transparent manner. On behalf of the Board, I would like to express sincere regret for the impact of the commercial income issue on this company, and would like to assure you that we have moved swiftly and decisively to address this serious matter. An explanation of this issue is set out on page 33. With my colleagues on the Board, I am determined that T esco will be known for the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical leadership. I would like to thank my predecessor Sir Richard Broadbent, who has been resolute in addressing the numerous challenges and handled the scrutiny which the company has been under with great dignity. I would also like to thank P atrick Cescau, Jacqueline T ammenoms Bakker, Liv Garfield and Gareth Bullock who have recently retired as Non-executive Directors and also Ken Hanna and Stuart Chambers who have decided not to seek re-election to the Board at the AGM. I'm delighted to welcome Richard Cousins, Mikael Olsson and Byron Grote to the Board. T esco is lucky to have an outstanding new management team led by our CEO, Dave Lewis, and our CFO, Alan Stewart. They are supported by a first-class team of people who have begun the hard work of putting this great business back on its feet. As I have visited stores and other sites I have been struck by the commitment, enthusiasm and capability of T esco' s people. I am very confident that with their support T esco will be successful in refocusing on customers, rebuilding trust and over time delivering progressively better returns. The challenges T esco faces remain significant and fixing them will take time. However, I firmly believe we have the right team and the right strategy to deliver the longer-term performance our shareholders expect and deserve. John Allan Chairman Visit www. com ar2015 to hear more from John Allan on his first months at Tesco John Allan Chairman First impressions 2 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 It was a huge honour for me to be asked to lead T esco. It' s a business I had worked with for 27 years. As a supplier, I always had enormous admiration for T esco - its people, passion, and expertise. So when I was invited to come in and lead this great organisation, it was an opportunity not to be missed. I arrived at a time of significant challenge. Clearly, for a number of years, the global retail market has been highly competitive. W e were losing market share in our critical home market and the growth momentum we had enjoyed internationally had faltered. The channel shift to online and convenience presented both challenge and opportunity, but the bottom line was that we had stopped growing. In addition, or perhaps as a result of this lack of growth, we had significant internal challenges. The commercial income issue identified in September was a significant blow and has resulted in a SFO regulatory inquiry. We have been cooperating fully with the inquiry and as we work on a programme of change across T esco, we must ensure this never happens again. Alongside these issues is a deeper challenge of trust. For customers to choose to shop with us, they have to place their trust in us - on price, quality, service and as a brand. But over a number of years, we'five seen a gradual erosion of that trust for a number of reasons. Earning that trust back is fundamentally important t o T esco. W e will do this not by any quick fix or short term initiative, but r ather by c ontinuous and lasting changes in what we do and how we behave. Despite the challenges, at no point during these first few months has my belief in the potential of T esco diminished. As I got to know the different parts of our business across Europe and Asia, I have found an energy and engagement by colleagues which is incredible - beyond anything I had expected. That passion to do the right thing f or cust omers and the expertise to mak e it happen still beats strongly within our business. I am extr aordinarily proud of the way that colleagues have responded t o the challenges we f ace. The business has started a long journey of renewal and change. In partic ular, the way c olleagues from across the business work ed so hard t o deliver a f antastic Christmas showed me the strength and depth of retailing expertise which exists within our business. The action we have taken so far has helped to reset the business and restore our customer focus. The reality is that it will require concerted action to get T esco back to where it should be. In this report we are publishing losses of PS6.4bn for 2014 15. These losses were largely the result of a series of one-off charges representing our past performance. They recognise a number of issues: the value of the property we own has fallen: the cost of dealing with our excess stock levels and restructuring costs, as well as the cost of the retail sites we are no longer developing. Our reduced trading profit of PS1.4bn reflects the challenges we have seen in the UK and in our overseas markets. While these results reflect the difficulties our business has faced over a number of years, we are also beginning to see early promising signs from the changes we have made. By focusing on the fundamentals of availability, service and targeted price reductions over the last six months, we have seen a steady increase in footfall, transactions and, most significantly, volumes. Our like-for-like sales volumes are now up for the first time in four years. Every day we are seeing our customers recognise this. P ut simply, more customers are now buying more things at T esco. Our task now is to build on this and nourish these small green shoots of recovery. We need to continue to listen to our customers and they will guide us. T esco became a great business by putting our customers at the heart of everything we do and we shall do that again. Customers today are hard pressed for both time and money. They want prices which are simple and stable, as well as low. Wherever they shop, they want great choice and outstanding service which makes their shopping easier. Above all they want help to make life a little simpler, every step of the way. With our reach, our f ootprint, our skills and capabilities, we are perf ectly plac ed to lead and off er this kind of servic e. When I look at our business, I see a sea of opportunity. What we need t o do now is unlock the potential which exists within T esc o - and to do that, we need t o do some k ey things differently. In October, we set out our three strategic priorities: 1. Regaining competitiveness in core UK business 2. Protecting and strengthening the balance sheet 3. Rebuilding trust and transparency Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive A fresh start Tesco has always been a champion for customers. The last few years have been challenging, but we are confident that if we get back to doing an unbeatable job for customers, our best days lie ahead. com ar2015 to hear more from Dave Lewis 3 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Over the last six months we have taken action to deliver on each of these priorities - sharpening our focus on availability, service and selectively on price: undertaking a significant programme of restructuring and financial discipline: and launching a programme of renewal to restore trust in every aspect of the brand. A key part of our early work has been to simplify our organisation in all our markets and to make sure that customers are the absolute focus of all parts of the Group. In many cases this has involved very difficult decisions. The consequence on our business and importantly on our colleagues has been significant. In the face of these changes they have been brilliant at all times, putting the needs of the customer and the business first, and I would like to thank them for that. Through these difficult changes we are confident that we give ourselves the chance to be great again. The changes we are making are significant and are likely to result in an increased level of volatility in our performance over the short term. We are still in an extremely challenging market and face tough trading conditions in the UK and overseas. The benefit of at least some of the changes we are making will only be seen over time. Crucially, however, the approach we are taking now is based on a clear commitment to reinvest any savings or outperformance in the shopping trip. The better our offer is for customers, the more customers will shop with us, and the stronger our business will be over the long term. As we continue the work of transforming T esco, my overriding message to the business is this: work as one team and keep it simple. T oo often in the past we have added in layers of complexity where simplicity was needed. The result is that we have sometimes lost focus on what our customers think and feel. A crucial part of that is about giving more power to colleagues - empowering them to do the right thing for customers. We firmly believe that if we give colleagues more power to choose the right actions, we'll do a better job for customers and achieve greater success for our business. And one of the reasons I believe this, are the stories I receive each day of colleagues going out of their way and doing exceptional things for our customers. A few months after I arrived at T esco, I was asked what had most surprised me since joining the business. My answer was how big its heart is. I have never met a business with so many colleagues doing so many things to help customers and communities on a daily basis. Whether it's raising millions for charity, taking hundreds of thousands of children on food education tours, or leading the charge against food poverty, the work colleagues do is simply awe-inspiring. This kindness and spirit is also in the DNA of T esco and I'd like us to show it just a little more. As we embark on this journey of renewal and change, we recognise the responsibility and opportunity that comes with the choices we make. Doing the right thing for customers in a way that supports communities and the environment will be crucial to our future success. T esco is a great British success story. We grew into a successful business by focusing on the customer and helping him and her with both the big and the little things. These are challenging times, and we must be prepared for further volatility in the coming months, but we are emerging stronger and we believe our destiny is in our own hands. If we keep focusing on our customers, and challenging ourselves to make every single customer experience better every day, we know we can succeed. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive \" We firmly believe that if we give colleagues more power to choose the right actions, we'll do a better job for customers\" 4 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Our starting point is the market where we serve the most customers: the UK. The UK represents more than two-thirds of our sales. So if we regain our competitiveness and do a better job for customers in this market, it will have a dramatic impact on the performance of the Group. We have been focusing on four things for our customers: Service. Our business is based on great service, but we haven't got this right in recent years. T o help fix this, we have invested in 4,652 new colleagues in customer-facing roles. We have also asked everyone who works in our offices to spend time working in store. Over the last few years, we have significantly increased the number of products in our ranges. This has put extra pressure on our store colleagues - and it's also left many customers confused. So over the course of this year and into the next we have started to review our ranges across all categories to make them simpler. As part of this we'five already met with over 100 suppliers. Partly because of an increasing range, we did not leave enough space for the most popular products and important items have not been available at peak times. We have now given more space to the top 1,000 lines in each store, resulting in marked improvements in product availability at peak times during the day. Along with great service and availability, we want to make those products which are most important to our customers as affordable as we can. As an example of this, we focused on the 'Festive Five', the five vegetables people most want with their Christmas lunches. Since January, we have dropped prices on hundreds of branded products and essential own-brand products. We are also committed to simpler, lower and more stable prices wherever we can. As a result of these changes, our customers are responding. Although we have work still to do, since October we have improved our competitiveness and every day more people are choosing to shop at T esco. In addition, we have identified cost savings across the Group of PS400m. We have also taken a difficult decision to close 43 unprofitable stores in the UK, and not to proceed with plans for 49 new stores. These decisions have been difficult but have been made to put the needs of the business and customers first. regain 5 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report protect We need to protect and strengthen our financial position so that we can maintain the flexibility to invest in a better shopping trip for customers. As a business we have too much debt with total leverage of PS 22 bn. We need to reduce that, both to deliver value for our shareholders, but also to free up money to invest in the shopping trip. In October we began an end-to-end review of all costs in the business. This has led to a number of significant decisions, including the decision not to pay a final dividend for 2014 15. Other key areas of focus include: Capital spending. We are committed to stronger financial discipline around capital spending. This year, we will be reducing capital expenditure to PS1bn. We have started a consultation to replace our defined benefit pension scheme for all colleagues. We are committed to protecting the pensions that colleagues have earned, and also to continuing to provide a competitive pension scheme for all colleagues. We have undertaken a detailed review of our property portfolio, including the leases which drive our PS1.5bn annual rent bill. As an example of this, we have completed an asset swap with British Land to regain sole ownership of 21 superstores, increasing the proportion of owned stores within our estate. As part of our review of the portfolio, all three Blinkbox businesses movies, music and books and T esco Broadband have been sold or closed. We have also appointed advisors to consider our options for dunnhumby. Alongside these structural changes is a cultural shift. Every pound we spend needs to be considered from the point of view of our customers. We want every spending decision to be weighed up against how many hours of store service the same investment would provide. 6 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Our third priority is to rebuild trust and transparency. We rely on the trust customers, suppliers, communities and shareholders place in us. Regrettably, this trust has been undermined, following the commercial income issue identified in September. What happened is a matter of profound regret for everyone at T esco. We have acted swiftly and decisively to ensure that it can never happen again. Across the business, we have brought in a wide ranging programme of change and renewal, which includes: New management who are transforming our commercial model to create long-term, mutually beneficial partnerships, with a greater focus on cost prices than on the commercial income we receive back from suppliers for promoting their products. A new Code of Business Conduct, supported by a company-wide training programme to help colleagues follow key policies. A speak-up culture, with a stronger focus on ethics and compliance. Code compliance and ethical leadership are now key factors in performance management and reward. In addition, we now have protector lines for both colleagues and suppliers, so any concerns with business conduct can be raised confidentially. Restoring trust is not just about process and structure. It' s about culture and individual actions. In the same way that every colleague holds the key to better customer service, so every colleague can help us to be a better active corporate citizen. We recognise the impact we can have on the lives of many - not just through our global reach but also in the way we run our business. For our customers, communities and the environment, we want our actions to make a big difference for everyone - and we are restless to build on the foundations we have in place. Key highlights this year include: Helping on health. In 1994 we were the first supermarket to take sweets off checkouts in our big stores. This year we became the first to do it in every UK store, including Express. We also announced our partnership with Diabetes UK and the British Heart Foundation to help tackle these diseases. It builds on our partnership with Diabetes UK which started in 2013 and raised over PS18m. Helping to tackle food poverty. Over the last three years we have pioneered a national programme of food collections working with FareShare and the T russell T rust. T ogether with customers we'five now provided over 21.5m meals for those in need. rebuild 7 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Our business model T esco grew into a big business by focusing on the little things. Not because we developed a highly complex business strategy. Nor because we developed a radical, revolutionary business model. We were successful because customers were our number one priority and everything we did was about doing the right thing for them. Our aim today is to regain that total focus on serving customers. We have refocused our business under three operational headlines: listening to, understanding and reaching out to customers to create the best possible offer working with growers and suppliers to make great products, and helping to deliver the best value to customers and working across different channels to get those products to customers in the most convenient way possible. Our aim is to make sure everything in the business is set up in the most efficient way to create value for customers. By refocusing on these three areas - and with the capabilities, reach, insight and skills we have within our business - we are uniquely placed to deliver the best offer we can and in doing so earn our customers' loyalty. By creating value for our customers, we will create sustainable value for our shareholders too. 8 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Reinvest Our clear priority is to improve Tesco for customers. As we do this, we have committed to reinvest any savings or outperformance into further improvements in our shopping trip. The reason for this reinvestment is clear: the better job we do for customers, the more we will improve our sales, and the more our sales improve, the more we can invest further in the shopping trip. Customers Tesco exists to serve customers - and our business model has customers as our number one priority. Our scale and reach mean we have the expertise to really understand our customers: allowing us to focus on the delivery of an offer with real value in all areas of price, quality, range and service. This focus means that we will champion our customers at every level and earn their loyalty. Channels To bring the best products to customers easily, we work through a range of channels - from small shops to large shops, and through our growing online business. We were the first retailer to offer 24-hour shopping and today we have thousands of Click & Collect points across the country. As part of improving our offer, we will invest in making our channels even more efficient and convenient for our customers. Product The offer we create for customers is developed by our Product team. They work with our suppliers to source the best possible range of quality products which meet and anticipate our customers' needs. Our relationships with suppliers are crucial to delivering our customer offer. Since October, we have been reviewing our partnerships to make sure we focus on delivering the best possible value to customers. 9 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report 70% work 58% 77 % shop Key performance indicators Our business has always been at its best when we'five made customers our number one priority. Colleagues want us to make it easier to put customers first. A key part of that is the way we measure performance and reward success. For a long time, we measured our performance using the Steering Wheel. This served us well for many years, but as time has gone on, it has become too complex, with over 40 different measures. We now have just six simple, key business performance measures. It's about alignment and focus: if we give our colleagues more power to choose the right actions, we'll do a better job for customers and achieve greater success for our business. The best result we can ever achieve is that our customers are so pleased with their experience at T esco that they recommend us to friends and shop with us again and again. We define loyal customers based on their frequency of shopping with us and average weekly spend. Over the past year, we have seen a 2.5 % decline in this measure. Going forward, this measure will provide a clear indication of our progress in regaining competitiveness. Customers recommend us and come back time and again 2. Colleagues recommend us as a great place to work and shop 3. We build trusted partnerships For customers to recommend us, we need to start with our colleagues and make sure T esco is a great place to work. In our latest survey, 70% of colleagues told us they would recommend T esco as a great place to work, and 77% said they would recommend us as a great place to shop. As part of our business transformation plan, we are committed to being more open, transparent and responsive to what really matters to colleagues. We are already making important changes, including new weekly calls between all store managers and senior leadership teams. Our business is built on strong partnerships. At a national level, we need to build trusted partnerships with suppliers to provide the best offer for customers. We also rely at a local level on partnerships with communities and wider society as part of our licence to operate. We survey our suppliers to capture how they feel about their relationship with T esco and the latest figures indicate that 58% feel satisfied. We have already started to make significant changes to the way we work with suppliers as part of our goal of restoring trust and transparency. 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 4. Improve operating cash flow If we do a better job for our customers, we will grow sales and achieve a stronger financial position. Last year, our Group sales declined by 1.4 %, reflecting a challenging backdrop and our own underperformance in the UK. While we must be prepared for further volatility, our focus will remain on our customers and we're working hard to have a positive impact on their shopping trip. As customers recommend us and keep returning to shop with us, our profitability will improve and we will achieve a stronger financial position. Group trading profit declined to PS1.4bn in 2014 15, driven by a challenging year for the UK business. We have taken action to start to restore our competitiveness and have committed to reinvest any savings back into the shopping trip to help our business be stronger over the long term. We need a strong cash flow so we can keep the business running and invest in our customers and the shopping trip. In 2014 15, our retail cash flow declined to PS1.9bn, reflecting both an extremely challenging year for T esco and a year in which we began a process of considerable change. Excluding VAT, fuel and IFRIC 13. Sales including fuel and VAT Sales excluding fuel and VAT 11 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Financial review Alan Stewart Chief Financial Officer Visit www. com ar2015 to find PDF and Excel downloads of our financial statements The reported year has been both an extremely challenging year for Tesco and a year in which we began a process of considerable change. Against this backdrop we delivered sales of PS70bn in 2014 15, 1.3 % below last year on a 52 week basis at constant currency. Trading profit declined by 58.1 % to PS1.4bn principally as a result of a fall in like-for-like sales, the accumulated costs of inefficiencies within our operations and the changes we have made in the second half to stabilise the business. Our statutory loss before tax was PS 6.4 bn, after charging one-off items of PS 7.0 bn. Of these one-off items, PS 0.6 bn will result in a direct cash outflow, with the remaining amounts being non-cash adjustments to balance sheet carrying values. Protecting and strengthening our balance sheet Upon our arrival as a new management team we identified protecting and strengthening the balance sheet as one of our three priorities. This resulted in a number of steps to begin to address our balance sheet leverage of PS 21.7 bn, which we define more broadly to include net debt, discounted rent or lease commitments and our IAS 19 net pension liability: Liquidity and funding: We have underpinned our liquidity and funding position with access to PS5bn of credit facilities, which remained undrawn at the year end. These facilities are secure, multi-year credit lines ensuring we have the flexibility to address our three immediate priorities over an appropriate timeframe. Capital expenditure: In 2014 1 5 we reduced our capital expenditure from PS2.7bn to PS2.0bn. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the Group's requirements we expect to further reduce our capital expenditure to PS1.0bn in 201 5 16, net of disposals, without adversely affecting our business. Dividends: Following the reduction in the interim dividend, the Board has recommended not to pay a final dividend. Pension: A plan to fund the deficit has been agreed with the T rustee with a payment of PS270m per annum and we are consulting with our colleagues to replace our defined benefit pension scheme with a defined contribution scheme. Property: We have undertaken a detailed review of our property portfolio, including where appropriate to review our lease commitments. In addition we have taken the difficult decision to close 43 unprofitable stores and not to proceed with 49 new store developments. In March 201 5 we also announced an asset swap with British Land, regaining sole ownership of 21 superstores and reducing our exposure to indexed rent reviews. Portfolio: In October we said that we would review our portfolio. T o date, this process has resulted in the sale or the closure of Blinkbox and T esco Broadband and the appointment of advisors to review our options for dunnhumby. In 2015 16, we will retain our focus on financial discipline. Enhanced disclosure Restoring trust and transparency is also one of our three priorities and part of this objective will be met by progressively enhancing our disclosure. In this review we provide greater clarity around commercial income and the valuation and ownership of our property. The Notes to the accounts also include enhanced disclosure of segmental assets in Note 2 on page 94, net debt in Note 30 on page 1 35, JVs and associates in Note 1 3 on page 1 10 and operating leases in Note 34 on page 1 37. Importantly, for 201 5 1 6 we will also move to a simpler profit measure based on operating profit adjusted only for large and distorting impacts.

Following the year end we completed the closure of 43 stores which we expect to impact our 2015 16 sales by around 0.4 %. Like-for-like sales, including VAT and excluding fuel, fell by 3.6 %. This reflected a challenging and deflationary market back drop - and our own underperformance. We'five seen some improvement recently with fourth quarter like-for-like sales performance of 1.0 % driven by positive volumes which represents an encouraging response to the customer-focused initiatives launched in the third quarter.

The decline principally reflected the combination of the deterioration in like-for-like sales and the impact of previous initiatives. The fundamental change to the way we do business with our suppliers, with significantly less focus on commercial income, further impacted profitability. The investment we have made in service, availability and, selectively in price in the second half is also a contributing factor.

In South Korea, the impact of the DIDA regulations has remained significant whilst in Thailand the recovery in consumer spending has been slower to materialise than initially anticipated. Our trading performance in Malaysia has been impacted by protests against some Western-owned businesses and a challenging economic environment. Our trading profit in Asia was 15.3 % lower year-on-year at constant rates, primarily due to the operational gearing effect from the impact of negative like-for-like sales performances in all three markets.

Sales in Europe reduced by 8.5 % on a 52 week basis including a 7.9 % foreign exchange effect as the Euro fell to seven-year lows against Sterling by year-end. Whilst we saw some improvement in the fourth quarter, the like-for-like sales performance was mixed over the course of the year. We have seen strong competition from discount retailers and this held back our sales performance, particularly in Ireland which saw a like-for-like sales decline of 6.3 %. The profitability of our Central European businesses continued to be under pressure and in Turkey included a PS 30 m charge relating to the write-off of a fuel debtor. Recent legislative changes in Hungary, including mandated store closures on Sundays and the introduction of a 'food supervision fee' from 1 January 2015, will have a material impact to ongoing market profitability. Consultation started in March 2015 on a significant restructure of the leadership team for Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia to move from operating as individual country teams to one regional team. This restructuring will create substantial buying and operational synergies, helping us to unlock more opportunities to invest in the customer offer.

We have expanded our range of mortgage and loan products and, in June 2014, we launched our personal current account. Our motor and home insurance business has seen 3% growth in accounts having expanded our underwriting providers and implemented digital improvements to enhance the customer experience. Trading profit was PS194m, in line with the prior year, with strong underlying growth offset by our ongoing investment in personal current accounts.

During the year the Group incurred PS 7. 0 bn of one-off and restructuring charges, largely reflecting the weak industry environment and the initiation of a number of measures to turnaround the performance of the Group. Of this amount, PS 0.6 bn will result in a direct cash outflow, with the remaining amounts being non-cash adjustments to balance sheet carrying values. These charges included: Fixed asset impairment and onerous lease charges: At each balance sheet date we review the carrying value of our stores to ensure that they are supported by their value in use or their fair value less the costs of disposal. Against the backdrop of challenging industry conditions and the decline in our profit, our review resulted in an impairment and onerous lease charge of PS 3.8 bn against our trading stores. A further impairment charge of PS 925 m is recognised in property related items, relating to the impairment of work-inprogress balances and charges relating to the closure of stores. Goodwill and other impairments: We have booked further goodwill and other impairments totalling PS 878 m. These include an impairment of PS 630 m relating to our investment with China Resources Enterprise Ltd CRE, PS 116 m relating to Dobbies and other UK businesses, and an impairment of PS 82 m in our investment in joint ventures which principally relates to the strategic decision to slow the roll out of Harris Hoole and Euphorium sites. Stock: The one-off items include a PS 570 m charge to the Group inventory position, principally due to the adoption of a forward-looking provisioning methodology. The charge also includes a PS 168 m impact of a reduction in the level of in-store costs capitalised to inventories. Restructuring: We have described a restructuring of central overheads, a simplification of store management structures and increased working-hour flexibility, which will deliver ongoing savings in the region of PS400m per year. These efficiencies will result in a one-off cost of PS 350 m of which around PS 300 m has been recognised in our 2014 15 results. The remaining balance includes a further PS 41 m relating to restructuring in the first half and a PS 20 m one-off cost relating to UK store closures. Commercial income adjustment: The commercial income adjustment refers to the impact on prior years of the commercial income issues that we announced last September. At the time of the interim results, the impacts on prior years were estimated as resulting in the profit before tax for the year ended 22 February 2014 being overstated by PS70m, and for the years prior to this being overstated by PS75m - a combined total of PS145m relating to prior years. Subsequent to October 2014, we continued to focus on this area and identified some further amounts, bringing the total one-off adjustment to PS208m for our UK and Irish businesses. 14 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Joint ventures, interest and tax Joint ventures and associates Losses from joint ventures and associates were PS 13 m, down from a profit of PS60m last year. The movement was primarily driven by a loss from our partnership with China Resources Enterprise Ltd CRE which was formed in May 2014. UK property joint ventures also made lower profits.

The increase in net finance costs reflected a higher level of debt and the set up costs relating to new credit facilities. Finance income reduced primarily reflecting the redemption of a medium term note and the expiry of the associated hedging instrument resulting in lower derivative income. Capitalised interest reduced by PS 35 m to PS44m, in line with reduced levels of work-in-progress. Taxation The effective rate of tax for the Group was 20.7%, with a charge of PS 199 m based on underlying profit. Last year's rate of 15.4% reflected the one-off effect of a lower UK corporate tax rate on deferred tax liabilities. Earnings per share Underlying diluted earnings per share were 9.42p, 70.6 % lower year-on-year at actual tax rates 70.5 % lower on a 52 week basis, driven by the decline in our trading profit performance. Statutory losses per share were 70.24 p reflecting one-off items. Dividend As announced in January, the Board has taken the decision not to recommend a final dividend, with the full year dividend charge solely reflecting the interim dividend of 1.16p paid on 19 December 2014. Future dividends will be considered within the context of the performance of the Group, free cash flow generation and the level of indebtedness.

Property As at the year end, the estimated market value of fully-owned property across the Group was PS22.9bn. This represents a reduction of PS7.6bn year-on-year driven mainly by the weakening of the UK and Central European property markets. This represents an estimated surplus of PS2.7bn over the net book value. The estimated market value excludes our share of property joint ventures. Including this, the valuation would increase by PS0.9bn, net of the debt in the joint ventures. Last year's disclosed property valuation of PS34.1bn included PS1.2bn relating to our Chinese operations now disposed to our joint venture and PS2.4bn from our share of joint venture property, before deducting debt. In March 2015, the British Land asset swap added a further PS0.7bn to the value of our property as we took ownership of 21 superstores.

Reflecting the lower level of underlying profitability, PS 0.6 bn in interest paid due to underlying finance costs and the timing of interest payments, and PS 0.3 bn of cash corporation taxes, net cash generated from retail operating activities was PS0.9bn. After cash capital expenditure of PS 2.2 bn this resulted in a free cash outflow in the year of PS 1.3 bn. This, combined with other movements led to a net debt movement of PS 1.9 bn. Pension On an accounting basis, the Group's net pension deficit after tax increased from PS 2.6 bn last year to PS 3.9 bn at the year end. This was driven by a reduction of 80 basis points in real corporate bond yields, leading to a corresponding reduction in the discount rate used to measure our long term liabilities, partially offset by a strong asset performance. On an actuarial basis, the deficit at 31 March 2014 was PS 2.8 bn and a plan to fund the deficit with cash contributions of PS270m per annum has been agreed with the Trustee. We are consulting with our colleagues to replace our defined benefit pension scheme with a defined contribution scheme. Total indebtedness We define our balance sheet leverage more broadly to include net debt, discounted rent and lease commitments and our IAS 19 pension liability. On this basis our total leverage or indebtedness was PS 21.7 bn, an increase of PS 3.1 bn driven by increases in both net debt and our pension liability. TY PSm LY PSm Net debt excludes Tesco Bank 8,481 6,597 Discounted operating lease commitments 9,353 9,419 Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax 3,885 2,559 Total indebtedness including lease commitments and pension deficit 21,719 18,575 Includes both continuing and discontinued operations. Our discounted minimum operating lease commitments were broadly unchanged at PS 9.4 bn, whilst our operating lease expense in the year increased by PS72m to PS1,486m. Around PS35m of this expense related to inflation-indexed rent which will not recur as a result of the British Land asset swap entered into post year end. The transaction will also result in the consolidation of net debt of around PS450m. Outlook The market is still challenging and we don't expect this to change in the immediate future. Over the next 12 months we will continue to focus on our three priorities: regaining competitiveness in our UK business: protecting and strengthening the balance sheet: and rebuilding trust and transparency in the business and the brand. We are already making good progress on these initiatives and on the basis of actions already undertaken they will deliver significant cost savings in 2015 16. The immediate priority for these and any other savings delivered is reinvestment in the customer offer in order to further restore UK competitiveness. Alan Stewart Chief Financial Officer 16 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Commercial income Commercial income represents part of our overall economic relationship with suppliers. Consistent with standard grocery market practice, we negotiate a very wide range of payments to and from our suppliers including fees, contributions, discounts, multiple offers and volume rebates. Whilst we have embarked on a fundamental review which will significantly simplify our approach, in total we currently use over 20 different categories of variation in payment terms. Many of these relate to adjustments to a cost price and can be considered and are in practice a part of the standard unit price variations that can be expected under normal, competitive market conditions. As such these amounts are recognised in the income statement as a deduction to the cost of goods sold. A number of commercial income categories can be conditional on the satisfaction of certain actions or performance conditions by either Tesco or the supplier in question, including the achievement of agreed sales volume targets, the provision of certain benefits such as marketing materials or promotional product positioning, and costs incurred for unplanned variations in product specification. In most instances, the arrangements that set out these terms cover periods that are within or end at the same point as our financial year. Where agreements are in place across a period end, judgement can be required to assess if the conditions will be met, and therefore to estimate the period end amounts payable and receivable. For example, where there are volume-related allowances spanning different account periods, the Group assesses the probability that targeted volumes will be achieved based on historical and forecast performance, recognising the appropriate amounts in the period end balance sheet and income statement. Commercial income is reflected in a number of balance sheet categories - principally due to differences in timing between recognition of income, receipt of cash and sale of goods. In order to provide greater clarity on the accounting for commercial income - including those instances where judgement and estimates are used - we are increasing our disclosure to show the effects of commercial income on the following balance sheet accounts: Inventories: The carrying value of inventories is reduced by the value of commercial income which will be earned when the associated stock is sold. Trade and other receivables: Amounts that have been invoiced to suppliers but not yet received are included within trade and other receivables. Accrued income: Any amounts earned but not yet invoiced to suppliers are included in accrued income. The majority relates to amounts outstanding under large supplier agreements or promotional allowances that run up to the period end. The balance primarily reflects amounts due under long-term agreements for volume rebates. Trade payables: Most agreements with suppliers enable income earned to be offset against amounts owed. These balances are included as a deduction within trade payables. Accruals and deferred income: Any amounts received in advance of income being earned are included in accruals and deferred income. The impact of commercial income on each of these accounts for the years to 28 February 2015 and 22 February 2014 is shown below: 2015 Group PSm UK PSm 2014 Group PSm UK PSm Current Assets Inventories 93 67 82 52 Trade and other receivablesOther receivables 97 54 89 22 -Accrued income 158 117 230 173 Current Liabilities Trade and other payablesTrade payables 347 173 547 368 -Accruals and deferred income 53 53 - - 17 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report We have an established risk management process to identify the principal risks that we face as a business.

The content of the Group Key Risk Register is considered and discussed through regular meetings with senior management and review by the Executive Committee and the Board. Our process for identifying and managing risk is set out in more detail on page 44 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015. The table below sets out our key risks, their movement during the year and examples of relevant controls and mitigating factors. The Board considers these to be the most significant risks faced by our Group that may impact the achievement of our three strategic priorities as set out on page 3. They do not comprise all of the risks associated with our business and are not set out in priority order. Additional risks not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse effect on the business. Key to risk movement Risk increasing No risk movement Risk decreasing Principal risks Risk movement Key controls and mitigating factors Customer If we do not meet customer needs and compete on price, product range, quality and service in the competitive UK and overseas retail markets, then we lose our share of customer purchases By not considering the customer at the heart of our decision-making processes, we adversely impact our relationship with customers We have strategically re-positioned our business to focus on the customer We are investing further in our customer proposition, reducing prices across our ranges and improving service with additional colleague hours Our performance is tracked within our business against measures that customers tell us are important to their shopping experience Customer perceptions of T esco and our competitors are regularly monitored to allow us to react quickly and appropriately Financial strategy There is a risk that the financial strategy is unclear or unsustainable Weak performance could put further pressure on free cash flow and impact our ability to improve our credit rating Our ability to operate successfully in international markets may be restricted if we cannot get the returns required in each market and this could adversely impact our profitability There is a risk that future legal and regulatory changes to the pension scheme could introduce more onerous requirements and increase our financial liability and that the deficit on the existing scheme could increase due to changes in assumptions on inflation, mortality and discount rates applied in determining liabilities of the scheme and the performance of its assets Investor support may be impacted if it takes longer than expected to demonstrate that our strategy is achieving the turnaround Strategic matters are regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee and Board and we seek external advice as required We have clear processes for the evaluation and identification of underperforming assets to ensure that appropriate action is taken Our plans and budgets are developed and presented to our Executive Committee and Board for approval to ensure targets and objectives are clear and consistent Our Group Property strategy ensures that there is a clear plan to address and control retail space, re-purpose space effectively where needed and ensure the right balance between freehold and leasehold space We are consulting on the closure of our UK pension scheme to all future accrual which, if approved, would stop the future growth of liabilities and significantly reduce liability risk in the scheme External expert advisors and the pension scheme T rustee are fully engaged to consider the funding position and fund performance of the pension scheme as well as the impact of legislative and regulatory changes There has been a triennial revaluation of the pension scheme assets and liabilities in the year and a deficit funding plan has been agreed with the T rustee We engage regularly with our investors to communicate details of our strategy and plans Further detail on the management of financial risks is set out on page 25 and in Note 22 on page 120 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Brand, reputation and trust Our brand will suffer if we do not rebuild trust and transparency in our business If we cannot be firm in the face of ethical, legal, moral or operational challenges, our reputation may be damaged Rebuilding trust and transparency in our brand is one of our three strategic priorities Our Group processes and policies set out how we can make the right decisions for our customers, colleagues, suppliers, communities and investors We have developed communication and engagement programmes to listen to our stakeholders and reflect their needs in our plans We maximise the value and impact of our brand with the advice of specialist external agencies and in-house marketing expertise We are developing new Corporate Responsibility goals that are aligned with customer priorities and our brand Principal risks and uncertainties In September 2014, we identified an overstatement of the expected financial results. This is now the subject of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and civil proceedings in the United States. Details can be found on page 33 and in Note 32 on page 136 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015. There are significant uncertainties as to the outcome of the existing investigation and proceedings, as to whether further proceedings may be brought against the Group in connection with the overstatement of the expected financial results and as to whether any proceedings brought against the Group would be likely to have a significant effect on the results of its operations or its financial condition. 22 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Principal risks Risk movement Key controls and mitigating factors Data security and privacy Increasing risks of cyber-attack threaten the security of customer, colleague and supplier data We must ensure that we understand the types of data that we hold and secure it adequately to manage the risk of data breaches We have active monitoring processes to identify and deal with IT security incidents A new Cyber Security team has been established to investigate and mitigate the risks of cyber-attack A Group-wide Information Security Blueprint has been rolled out across our businesses There is a programme of compliance monitoring and review being rolled out with training across our businesses A programme to review the use, storage and security of customer data is in progress Transformation If the scale of the change across our business disrupts our focus, there is a risk that we will not transform the business to where it needs to be There is a risk that we underestimate the wider impacts of the changes that we are making NEW There is Executive sponsorship of the T ransformation programme with the creation of a T ransformation Director role New Group structures have been designed to simplify our business and clarify accountability A new Programme Management Office has been established to manage the T ransformation programme and will be supported by experienced resource from within the business and externally as required Competition and markets If we fail to address the differing challenges of the budget retailers, the premium retailers and online entrants, it may adversely impact our market share and profitability We actively seek to be competitive on price, range and service as well as developing our online and multiple formats to allow us to compete in different markets Our Executive Committee and operational units regularly review markets, trading opportunities and competitor strategy and activity Performance If our strategy is not effectively communicated or implemented, our business may underperform against plan and competitors The delivery of long term plans may be impacted if the business focuses on short term targets only Our Board, Executive Committee and operational units meet regularly to review performance risks All businesses have targets based on a new balanced scorecard of performance against KPIs and financial targets.

Further explanation of these risks is set out in Note 22 on page 120 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015. An overview of the management of these risks is set out below. Details of the main financial risks relating to T esco Bank and the management of those risks can be found in Note 22 on page 123 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015. Financial risks Key controls and mitigating factors Funding and liquidity risk The risk of being unable to continue to fund our operations on an ongoing basis The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, disposals of assets, debt capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases New funding of PS2.3 billion was raised during the year, including PS2.1 billion from long term debt and PS0.2 billion from property disposals. At the year end, net debt was PS8.5 billion 2014: PS6.6 billion The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities and to maintain access to capital markets so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due T esco has put in place PS5 billion of committed facilities consisting of a revolving credit facility and bilateral lines as alternate sources of liquidity At the year end, the Group had a long-term credit rating of BBBnegative from Fitch, Ba1 stable from Moody's and BB stable from Standard & Poor's Interest rate risk The risk to our profit and loss account resulting from rising interest rates Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and floors may be used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt Our policy is to fix interest rates for the year on a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs of the Group excluding T esco Bank. At the year end, the percentage of interest-bearing debt at fixed rates was 79% 2014: 84%. The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate form. The average rate of interest paid on an historic cost basis this year, excluding joint ventures and associates, was 4.09% 2014: 4.5% Foreign exchange risk The risk that exchange rate volatility may have an adverse impact on our balance sheet or profit and loss account Transactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are managed, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies and purchased currency options. At the year end, forward foreign currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to PS2.2 billion were outstanding 2014: PS2.9 billion as detailed in Note 21 on page 116 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015. We translate overseas profits at average foreign exchange rates We only hedge a proportion of the investment in our international subsidiaries as well as ensuring that each subsidiary is appropriately hedged in respect of its non-functional currency assets. During the year, currency movements increased the net value, after the effects of hedging, of the Group's overseas assets by PS5 million last year decrease of PS1,102 million Counterparty risk The risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions The Group holds positions with an approved list of highly rated counterparties T esco monitors the exposure, credit rating, outlook and credit default swap levels of these counterparties on a regular basis Insurance risk The risk of being inadequately protected from liabilities arising from unforeseen events We purchased assets, earnings and combined liability protection from the open insurance market for higher value losses only The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the business with some cover being provided by our captive insurance companies, ELH Insurance Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the Republic of Ireland. ELH Insurance Limited covers Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability, while Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability only This Strategic report, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, has been approved and signed on behalf of the Board.

        "Detailed Analysis of ROE": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is ROE increasing or declining?**  \n  The **Return on Equity (ROE)** is increasing, from **0.174 (previous year)** to **0.187 (current year)**, indicating an improvement in the company's ability to generate profit from shareholders' equity.\n\n- **Is growth in ROE higher than that of competitors and the industry?**  \n  The textual report does not provide explicit competitor or industry ROE data. However, the company reported strong financial growth, including **17.6% constant currency revenue growth** and increased **return on capital employed (ROCE) from 22.3% to 23.3%**. These suggest the company is performing well relative to typical telecom sector growth rates in sub-Saharan Africa, implying its ROE growth is likely competitive or better than the industry average.\n\n- **Is growth persistent or temporary?**  \n  Growth appears **persistent** as it is supported by multiple factors:  \n  - Sustained **double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth** despite macroeconomic challenges.  \n  - Strategic investments in **4G/5G spectrum and network expansion** to capture future opportunities.  \n  - Strong focus on **mobile money services growth** which now accounts for over **13% of total revenue**.  \n  - Effective **cost management** and **debt localisation**, improving financial resilience.  \n  These factors signal a well-executed, long-term growth strategy rather than a one-time boost.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- Expected **ROE next year** is likely to continue its upward trend, potentially reaching or exceeding **19%**, given the ongoing investments, expanding customer base, and improved operational efficiencies disclosed in the report.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The company's **ROE increased from 17.4% to 18.7%**, reflecting improved profitability on shareholder equity.  \n- Growth in ROE is supported by **strong revenue (17.6% in constant currency) and EBITDA growth (17.3%)**, underpinned by strategic investments in technology and mobile money services.  \n- The company's **persistent growth strategy** through network expansion, service diversification, and cost control signals sustainability in ROE improvements.  \n- Risks to be mindful of include **currency devaluation and foreign exchange volatility**, which have impacted finance costs and could affect future profitability.  \n- The company\u2019s **balance sheet strengthening and debt localisation** efforts mitigate some financial risks, supporting continued ROE growth.",
        "Detailed Analysis of ROE Drivers": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?**  \n  The growth in ROE is driven primarily by an increase in **Assets Turnover** from **2.28** to **2.84**, indicating improved efficiency in using assets to generate revenue. However, the **Profit Margin** has slightly decreased from **13.36%** to **12.59%**, showing a marginal decline in profitability per dollar of revenue. This suggests that ROE growth is mainly efficiency-driven and not supported by margin expansion.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  The textual report highlights strong revenue growth and operational efficiency, with an underlying EBITDA margin maintained at **49.0%** despite inflationary pressures. While **Profit Margin** has declined slightly, the company still maintains robust profitability. The **Assets Turnover** increase suggests strong asset utilization, likely above industry average for telecoms in Sub-Saharan Africa given the rapid customer growth and network expansion. Overall, both efficiency and margin levels appear competitive within the dynamic and underpenetrated markets served.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year:** Continue improving, forecast around **2.90**, supported by network expansion and increased customer base.  \n- **Expected Profit Margin next year:** Slight recovery or stabilization around **12.6% to 13.0%**, assuming cost control measures offset inflationary pressures.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The increase in **Assets Turnover** is the stronger driver of ROE growth, reflecting improved asset utilization and network expansion.  \n- **Profit Margin** shows a modest decline, likely due to inflation and currency volatility, but remains robust and competitive within the industry context.  \n- **Efficiency gains** through leveraging infrastructure and customer growth underpin positive **Forecasts** for continued ROE improvement, with margin expected to stabilize as cost initiatives take effect.",

With prices of basic commodities on the increase, and instances of severe climate disruptions, reliable, affordable telecoms services that connect people to each other and to the wider economy are more vital than ever. Everyone at Airtel Africa is proud that we have been able to maintain and expand our services to our customers and communities throughout the year. The fact that we have also been able to deliver a strong financial performance in this economic context is testament to the scale of the untapped demand in sub-Saharan Africa, and to the resilience of our business model. Powerful underlying macroeconomic and demographic trends continue to drive demand and adoption of voice, data and mobile money services, and our 'Win with' strategy continues to deliver growth: our customer base grew to 140 million people this year, and our revenues grew by 11.5% in reported currency. This is not growth for its own sake. It is only by pursuing sustainable growth that we are able to fulfil our purpose of transforming lives: playing our part in addressing the challenges faced by millions of people who still lack access to data and financial services, and the wider transformation of economies that will drive sustainable development. Playing our part in sustainable development Publishing our first Sustainability Report in October 2022 was a seminal moment for Airtel Africa, furthering our commitment to corporate governance. It provides stakeholders with a transparent account of our progress in delivering the sustainability ambitions that underpin our business strategy, and our commitment to developing the infrastructure and services that will drive digital and financial inclusion for people across Africa while contributing to six of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals UN SDGs. The Board closely oversees this strategy as part of our role in considering environmental, social and governance criteria in our decision-making. Business has a crucial part to play in Africa's development. This year, as Chair of the newly launched B20 India Action Council on African Economic Integration: An Agenda for Global Business, I have seen positive signs of businesses coming together to work towards common goals and priorities. Airtel Africa plays a significant role in supporting education, which has long been a priority for me and for everyone in the Group. We have set ourselves the goal of transforming the lives of over one million children on the continent through education by 2027, including through our landmark five-year partnership with UNICEF - which this year rolled out programmes in 6 of the 13 countries where the partnership is in place. Investing to create long-term value for all Our underlying strategy remains unchanged in its fundamentals. We maintain a continuous focus on serving customers' needs so we can deliver sustainable, profitable growth, while mitigating our risks and maintaining our longstanding focus on strengthening our balance sheet. This year, for instance, we continued to localise our debt into our country-level OpCos while reducing HoldCo debt, helping to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange volatility. Our gross OpCo debt of $3,676m including lease liabilities is now higher than our remaining HoldCo debt of $550m. T ransforming lives Providing essential services, and delivering on our purpose of transforming lives. STRATEGIC REPORT 13 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Leverage was at 1.4x in March 2023, broadly flat from the previous year. This was achieved alongside substantial investments: we invested $748m in capex excluding spectrum, and $500m in spectrum including 5G in key markets - ensuring we are ready to meet the continuing opportunity in data. Almost 87% of our capex investment in 2022 23 was directed to growth initiatives that help ensure a sustainably strong and reliable network. We continue to strengthen the business in other ways. We have made compelling strides in building the standalone capabilities of our Airtel Money business across all markets and begun acting on the opportunity presented by the granting of our super-agent licence and Payment Service Bank PSB licence in Nigeria in April 2022. We have also established new holding and subsidiary company structures for our data and fibre businesses. The Board of directors has recommended a final dividend of 3.27 cents per share, making the total dividend for 2022 23 5.45 cents per share, which is an increase of 9% in line with our progressive dividend policy. Stakeholders at the heart of transforming lives Everything the business has achieved in this turbulent year is thanks to the support of all our stakeholders. In particular, our people have continued to show great dedication to ensuring the delivery of services and to serving our customers and the communities in which we live and work. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank them for their continuing commitment to transforming lives. Sunil Bharti Mittal Chair 10 May 2023 Pursuing sustainable growth enables us to fulfil our purpose of transforming lives: playing our part in addressing the challenges faced by millions of people who still lack access to connectivity, data and financial services. We are committed to contributing towards the wider transformation of economies to drive sustainable growth and development. How will you look back at this year? The joy of running this business - and the thing that I see motivating our people - is that we are part of the solution to the challenges around us. There's no doubt this has been a difficult year for many in our communities. While sub-Saharan Africa is very resilient, it is not immune to global economic shocks. Sharp commodity and fuel inflation really hurts in communities where many people spend 40% of their income on food. Climate change has a disproportionate impact on Africans. Currency disruptions create serious challenges for businesses and individuals. But as Airtel Africa people, we are part of our communities - we share their pain as well as their joy. And we can see the difference we're making. Every day, we're connecting customers to each other, to the digital future, and to economic opportunity. The more we serve, the more we succeed. By delivering our strategy and growing our business, we're part of the process of sustainable development. That's what we mean by transforming lives. What were the highlights of your financial performance? We'five really demonstrated the resilience of our strategy and business model. The economic environment has generated considerable headwinds this year, but we have delivered significant growth in all our key metrics. Our revenues grew by 11.5% and operating profit by 14.5% in reported currency. We have grown revenues in data by 23.8%, in voice services by 11.8% and in mobile money by 29.6% in constant currency. We'five continued to provide essential services in all our markets throughout the year, and to serve more customers than ever before, reaching 140 million in total. Underlying EBITDA grew by 17.3% in constant currency at a stable EBITDA margin of 49.0% despite all the turbulences. We know how important affordability is to customers in a cost-ofliving crisis - and our philosophy has always been to drive usage, rather than price. Not only are we reaching more customers, but our customers are getting more for their money. This performance has made us one of the fastest-growing telecoms company in sub-Saharan Africa. And it has come alongside important investment in our future - and in the future of our communities. We invested $748m in expanding and strengthening our network, so we can reach and include more people. We invested in our fibre infrastructure and data centres, where we see opportunities to form mutually beneficial partnerships with other businesses. And as of 31 March 2023, we invested $500m in spectrum which includes 5G, so we can meet the demand for data now, and be ready for an even more digital future. The macroeconomic outlook remains volatile, but we are well positioned to deliver against the growth opportunities these markets offer, with a continued focus on margin resilience. How has your 'Win with' strategy created competitive advantage? Our 'Win with' strategy has six pillars - 'technology', 'distribution', 'data', 'mobile money', 'cost' and 'people' - all underpinned by our sustainability strategy. It is the execution of the strategy that really counts - and I believe we can be proud of the execution of every pillar. I'five already mentioned the expansion of our network, and how the talent and determination of our people has driven our success. The 46.3% increase in data usage demonstrates how that pillar is thriving - and the 36% increase in home broadband revenues shows what an opportunity there is in that segment. 'Win with cost' has been important this year, as we'five had great success maintaining margins despite unprecedented inflation - our underlying EBITDA margin was 49.0%. We'five also localised much of our debt as mitigation against foreign exchange risk, maintaining Group debt at 1.4x of underlying EBITDA while investing significantly in the future. But some of the strongest examples of us executing the strategy and winning in the market have been in 'Win with distribution' and 'Win with mobile money'. Our distribution network gets us closer to our customers so they can access our services - and this year we increased the number of our customer activating outlets by 21% bringing the total number of 304,000 outlets across our 14 markets. Airtel Money, meanwhile, has gone from strength to strength, with 20.4% more mobile money customers, and transaction value increasing by 41.3% in constant currency. Why is the mobile money opportunity so important? Mobile money is a clear example of an opportunity to benefit communities while driving business growth. Sub-Saharan Africa remains underserved by banks and financial services, excluding millions of people from the financial system, and disproportionately excluding women. Chief executive officer Olusegun Ogunsanya reflects on a year in which our robust business performance has helped drive our sustainability agenda - and on our opportunity to transform lives in Africa. CEO Q&A Chief executive officer's review 14 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 STRATEGIC REPORT Watch the full interview online Olusegun Ogunsanya Chief executive officer It is a competitive sector, where we need to keep building our ecosystem to stay ahead of new fintech offers, engage with Central Banks to meet growing regulatory requirements, and make sure we have the right IT capabilities. But we'five made significant strides through Airtel Money this year, launching mobile money services in Nigeria through our new Payment Services Bank PSB licence granted in April 2022, rolling out micro merchant propositions in Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia, and introducing loan products in Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya and Zambia. And as our mobile money business has grown, we'five invested in growing Airtel Money's organisational capabilities, skills and technology. This work is underpinned by our sustainability strategy, which sets targets for building our mobile money ecosystem and includes a specific target to reach 20 million women customers by 2025. You published your first sustainability report in October 2022 - what were the highlights? A. Airtel Africa has supported communities in areas including education, health and wellbeing, and disaster relief for decades - but we achieved a real step change in our approach to environment, social and governance ESG through our sustainability strategy, launched in 2021. This year we achieved another milestone with our Sustainability Report, which demonstrated progress against all our targets - but also highlighted how much there is still to do in order to achieve the sustainable development goals that we support. One of the biggest elements of our work this year has been developing our pathway to net zero as we strive to limit the impact of our operations on the environment. Our detailed analysis across 14 OpCos has highlighted significant decarbonisation strategies we can implement to reduce our carbon emissions. We have set a target to reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity by more than 60% within ten years of our baseline and achieve net zero by 2050. Our investment in network expansion, particularly in rural and semi-rural areas, is giving millions of people access to reliable and high-quality digital and financial services, often for the first time. We're making progress on building a diverse and inclusive workforce, where all our people can develop their careers and reach their full potential. And we continued to work on our landmark partnership with UNICEF, providing educational resources, free of charge, to more than 250,000 children this year on our way to reaching one million children by 2027. Our partnership with UNICEF, for me, stands as a beacon for what our business is all about. Education is a vital engine for social mobility, social equality, and the elimination of poverty - alongside the services we provide, it will unlock opportunity in Africa, and transform lives. Olusegun Ogunsanya Chief executive officer 10 May 2023 Our strategy for growth in action 46.3% 41.3% increase in data usage increase in transaction value for Airtel Money in constant currency The more we serve, the more we succeed. 15 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Our investment proposition Our operations in 14 sub-Saharan African countries offer substantial market potential across voice, data and mobile money services. We have the diversity and scale to deliver affordable telecoms and mobile money services to our customers. Our accelerated investment into our asset base, strong brand recognition and effective distribution channels both direct and indirect give us sustainable differentiation in the market. We continue to deliver a strong track record of growth and improved operational performance. Our lean and simplified operating model, combined with our effective management team, has delivered double-digit revenue growth, strong profitability and cash flow despite inflationary pressures across many of our markets. Strong country level management teams with deep knowledge of their markets are supported by subject matter experts at Group level. Our performance reflects the strength of our risk management framework, which ensures compliance with regulatory policies across our markets. We also benefit from the strength and support of our shareholder Bharti Airtel, one of the world's largest telecoms operators. Led by our purpose of transforming lives, with a customer-centric vision of enriching the lives of our customers, we deliver sustainable, profitable and market-leading growth through our six-pillar strategy: 'Win with'... technology, distribution, data, mobile money, cost and people. We are reducing the digital divide and enhancing financial inclusion, including through partnerships with governments in the countries where we operate. Our business strategy is underpinned by our sustainability strategy, which ensures environmental, social and governance ESG considerations shape all the actions we take to deliver on our ambitions. We're focused on digitising our own processes and services as well as how our customers use our products. We also continue to leverage our substantial infrastructure across the continent to seek out new, profitable revenue streams by enhancing our service offerings to enterprises, including fibre and data centres. Our strong balance sheet and conservative capital structure allow us to fully execute our growth strategy and create value for all our stakeholders: customers, communities, regulators and governments, partners and suppliers, our people and our shareholders. The countries we operate in have some of the youngest populations in the world, and are projected to grow fast, contributing to sustainable growth in our customer base. Combined with relatively low numbers of unique mobile customers, low minutes of usage, low data consumption and limited traditional banking services, this creates a huge opportunity for the continued growth of Airtel Africa.

This growth was largely driven by expansion of our mobile money agents and merchant ecosystems and continued investment in our exclusive franchise channel of kiosks and branches. Our enhanced distribution channel ensures availability of mobile money float across our footprint. In Nigeria, mobile money services SmartCash were launched in June 2022. Our initial focus has been to invest in the platform technology, as well as the business systems and processes to ensure confidence and reliability in the platform.

And among a population of more than 1 billion people in sub-Saharan Africa, half of whom will be under 25 years old by 2050, there is huge scope to increase the reach and penetration of effective voice, data and mobile money services, and to include more people in the digital economy. The need for accessible, affordable services has never been greater - as demand continued to rise in 2022 despite economic turbulence and inflationary shocks across the region. Mobile services: often the only way to connect Millions of people in our markets lack access to landline infrastructure, and broadband penetration levels are far lower than in much of the world. Mobile networks continue to be the primary source of voice and data services for the vast majority of sub-Saharan Africans - which means that our focus on expanding our networks and extending rural coverage plays a vital role in including people in the mobile and digital economy. In 2022 23, we invested $700m in capital expenditure, predominantly in our networks, and there is a great opportunity to expand coverage further. Mobile connectivity in our markets is still low relative to other regions - though people's appetite for connection means it is growing fast. By the end of 2021, 515 million people subscribed to mobile services in sub-Saharan Africa, representing 46% of the population - almost 20 million more than in 2020. It is projected that there will be nearly 100 million new subscribers by 2025, taking the total number of subscribers to 613 million 50% of the region's population i. Accessibility will continue to underpin this growth: we added 2,700 sites to our network in the past year and grew our customer base by 9.0%. Harnessing digitalisation as the engine of growth Africa's future economic growth will be driven by digitalisation - which places it high on the agenda of many governments in our markets. Businesses and service providers need reliable, competitively priced data in order to flourish and generate economic value. Mobile technology enables digital solutions and supports the growing use of online channels by consumers, while effective broadband can help businesses thrive. The GSMA estimated that in 2022, 40% of the adult population in sub-Saharan Africa was connected to mobile internet services - a rapid increase since 2001, when the figure was 1%, but there is clear evidence that expansion still has far to go. The same report showed there is also a usage gap: 44% of adults live in areas covered by mobile broadband networks but do not yet use mobile internet services. Smartphone adoption in our markets remains relatively low, at around 36.3%, although it improved by 2.1% in 2022 23. 4G coverage is also expanding - our own 4G network now reaches 65.9% of the population in our footprint, an annual increase of 3.3%. And in the future, there will be a clear role for 5G - which is why we continued to invest in 5G spectrum this year. Our strategic focus on winning with data, supported by our expanding digital products and content, Airtel TV, and our focus on supporting enterprises, places us at the forefront of this digital opportunity - which will transform lives while driving business growth. For more information about Airtel Business, see page 74 Mobile money - driving financial inclusion More people than ever now enjoy access to formal financial services, thanks to the growth of digital financial services in sub-Saharan Africa. Africa as a whole, which has historically been underserved by formal banking, is now home to almost half of digital financial services users worldwide. And financial services are critical to wider economic development and opportunity: financial inclusion is an enabler for seven of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals UN SDGs. Africa's domestic e-payments market is expected to see revenues grow by approximately 20% per year, reaching around $40 billion by 2025, according to a 2022 McKinsey Report. Airtel Money is well-placed to be part of this opportunity. We continue to build the mobile money ecosystems that help customers join the digital economy, and to win new customers through services, including interoperability, payments, micro-loans and international money transfers. For more information about our Airtel Money business, see pages 72-73 Affordability critical amidst cost-of-living pressures Global economic turbulence has had an impact on many of our markets over the past year, with prices for food and fuel rising rapidly, exacerbated in some markets by supply chain disruptions and foreign exchange fluctuations. Consumers have felt these inflationary pressures keenly - and while demand for telecoms services continues to rise, affordability remains very important. We offer pricing plans that are simple and transparent, based on the principle of 'more for more' - meaning that the cost of connecting has fallen in real terms. The competitive landscape continues to be dominated by a few large competitors, with some smaller regional companies in some markets. High demand across sub-Saharan Africa There is a clear runway for growth in sub-Saharan Africa, where a young and growing population demand data, mobile voice, and mobile money services to connect with each other, do business, and unlock economic opportunity. STRATEGIC REPORT 21 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 So alongside price, we compete for customers through our range of services, our advertising and brand image, the quality and reliability of our service, and our wide coverage. Our focus on distribution is designed to give us competitive advantage in recruiting and winning new customers. The overall economic picture in our markets is of subdued current growth - but huge potential for the future. Real GDP in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to have grown by 3.6% in 2022, reflecting a slowdown from 4.7% in 2021, and is forecast to remain at around 3.7% in 2023. iI Over the next three decades, however, the population is set to nearly double, to around 2 billion, with 32.2% of the population in our markets between the ages of 10 and 24 years, and GDP is expected to grow at around 7%. For more information about our 'Win with' strategy, see pages 26-37 Managing risk, and contributing to sustainable development As in any business sector, telecoms in sub-Saharan Africa operates against a background of risks and challenges, as well as opportunities. Among these risks, currency devaluation and, in some cases this year, shortages of foreign currency in local markets need to be carefully managed and mitigated - this is addressed as a principal risk in our risk management framework, which covers a range of strategic, financial, operational, governance and compliance risks. Africa is also disproportionately affected by climate change, which presents a real risk to economies and communities. Our sustainability strategy is designed to ensure we make a meaningful contribution to the societies and economies where we live and work. We have been working closely with The Carbon Trust over the last six months, to develop a detailed pathway for the reduction of our greenhouse gas GHG emissions. We have completed a detailed audit of our assets and have identified specific programmes and initiatives to significantly reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions. These initiatives have been analysed across our footprint by a cross-functional taskforce which has been established to oversee the project. This taskforce updates the Sustainability Committee regularly. For more information, see how we manage our risk on pages 90-97 For information about our sustainability strategy, see pages 38-55 Operating in a highly regulated sector All telecommunication operators must work within the frameworks created by governments and regulatory authorities, covering telecoms regulations, banking regulations and licences. Alongside strict compliance with regulations, we aim to work collaboratively with governments to make sure we integrate our services into their key initiatives and play our part in strengthening economies and transforming lives. In many markets, Know Your Customer KYC regulations apply - these require customers to register their identity to access mobile services. Providing easy access to a fast and compliant registration process is a key part of our 'Win with' distribution approach. Data security is another concern for regulators and consumers - and as part of our sustainability strategy, we operate under the 'Information Security Management System' ISO 27001 certification and the 'Business Continuity Management System' ISO 22301 certification, which cover all mobile communication and mobile money operations.

The legal and regulatory frameworks we work within fall into three categories: telecoms services, mobile financial services and broadcasting services. In some of our markets, there are also competition laws. We keep the regulatory framework under continuous review, and publish significant developments on our corporate website, under 'Regulatory news'. Here we describe the most significant developments in our largest markets this year. T ax developments In 2022 23 several governments reviewed their tax arrangements: Democratic Republic of the Congo - tax on telecommunication services In March 2022, the DRC government introduced a new telecoms tax on usage. In October 2022, the provisions of the telecoms tax were suspended and the government agreed to introduce a fixed tax based on each operator's market share. This resulted in reduced cost for operators. Gabon - Finance Act 2023 In February 2023, the Finance Act 2023 introduced a tax on mobile money at the rate of 0.5% of the revenues collected by mobile operators. Kenya - tax on handsets and imported SIM cards In July 2022, the new Finance Act re-introduced 10% excise duty on importation of handsets and a KES 50 duty per unit on imported ready-to-use SIM cards. This will impact the cost of handset devices and the cost of services. Niger - Finance Law 2022 In December 2022, the Government of Niger introduced a stamp duty of 2% of the value of the invoice of each contract that mobile operators enter with suppliers. This tax increases the overall cost of doing business in Niger. The finance law also abolished the tax on incoming international traffic, thus lowering the cost of incoming calls. Tanzania - Finance Act 2022 The Finance Act 2022 introduced amendments that resulted in reduction of levies on electronic mobile money transfers and withdrawals. This reduction has benefited customers and resulted in increased uptake of the services. Zambia - Finance Act 2023 In January 2023, the Finance Act 2023 abolished the two-tier taxation system that existed in Zambia where corporations in the telecommunication sector paid corporate tax at the rate of 40%, with all other corporations paying 35%. This law harmonised corporate tax across all sectors of the economy at the rate of 35%. The Act also reduced customs duty to 0% and 5% from 15% and 25%, respectively, for a period of three years, on selected information and communications technology ICT and telecommunications equipment to encourage uptake. We operate within the laws and regulatory frameworks of governments and regulatory agencies to bridge the digital divide and expand financial inclusion in our markets - and we always work to ensure that our operations meet local legal and regulatory requirements.

Nigeria - Payment Service Bank PSB Licence On 27 April 2022, the Central Bank of Nigeria issued SmartCash PSB Limited with final approval to operate as a Payment Service Bank PSB in Nigeria. Spectrum acquisitions Democratic Republic of the Congo In May 2022, Airtel DRC S. A. acquired 58 MHz of additional spectrum spread across 900, 1800, 2100 and 2600 MHz bands, for a gross consideration of $42m from Yozma, through a process that involved the surrender of the licences by Yozma to the government, and the direct acquisition of the spectrum by Airtel DRC S. A. which was confirmed by the modification of the Airtel licences by the State to incorporate the new spectrum. The licence for 10 MHz of paired spectrum in the 2100 MHz band will come up for renewal in September 2032. All the other licences will continue until July 2036. Kenya In July 2022, Airtel Networks Kenya Limited acquired 60 MHz in the 2600 MHz spectrum band for a period of 15 years upon payment of $40m. Nigeria On 6 December 2022, the regulator confirmed that Airtel Networks Nigeria Limited Airtel Nigeria had emerged as the sole bidder in the 3.5 GHz spectrum auction. Airtel Nigeria was awarded one lot in the 3.5 GHz spectrum auction at a price of $285m for a period of ten years from 1 March 2023. On 8 December 2022, the regulator awarded Airtel Nigeria two slots of 5 MHz each in the 2.6 GHz band for a period of ten years at a price of $32m. On 13 March 2023, the Nigeria Communications Commission NCC offered Airtel Nigeria the opportunity to renew its 2100 MHz spectrum licence at a price of N58,659, 955,200.00 equivalent of $150m for a period of 15 years. Airtel Nigeria has accepted the offer. Tanzania In October 2022, Airtel Tanzania was awarded 80 MHz in the 3500 MHz band and two blocks of 15 MHz in the 2600 MHz band at the price of $21m and $39m, respectively. The spectrum was issued for a period of 15 years from the date of award. Zambia 800 MHz and 2600 MHz band: on 14 July 2022, the regulator awarded Airtel Zambia two blocks of 10 MHz in the 800 MHz band at the price of $17m and one block of 50 MHz in the 2600 MHz band at the price of $12m. 2.6 GHz spectrum: on 15 November 2022, Airtel Zambia was awarded a further 40 MHz in the 2600 MHz band at the price of $12m. The spectrum assigned to Airtel Zambia is renewable annually at no additional cost for the duration of operating licences until 2028. Licence modification in Rwanda In 2022 the Government of Rwanda released their revised broadband policy. This required the full liberalisation of the telecommunications sector and proposed to move away from technology-specific 2G, 3G, 4G licences and services to technology-neutral licences and services. It also removed the restriction that previously existed in respect of access to spectrum, which is typically used for 4G, 5G and future technologies. It also involved the removal of the restriction in respect of direct provision of services that fall within these categories of technology. In January 2023, the regulator commenced the process of modifying existing telecommunication licences to conform the telecom licences to the requirements of the revised broadband policy. Under the modified licence, Airtel Rwanda will be able to access spectrum for 4G, 5G and future technologies and offer 4G services using existing spectrum without restriction. Submarine cable licences Republic of the Congo In June 2022, the regulator issued Airtel Congo S. A. with a submarine cable licence for a period of ten years in preparation of the landing of the 2Africa submarine cable in the Republic of the Congo. Tanzania In August 2022, the regulator issued Airtel Tanzania plc with an addendum to its national and international network facilities and network services licences to extend their scope to allow for the landing and operating of the 2Africa submarine cable systems in Tanzania. Uganda listing Under Airtel Uganda's National Telecom Operator NTO licence, Airtel Uganda Limited Airtel Uganda is obliged to comply with the sector policy, regulations and guidelines requiring the listing of part of its shares on the Uganda Stock Exchange USE. The current Uganda Communications Fees and Fines Amendment Regulations 2020, creates a public listing obligation for all NTO licensees, and specifies that 20% of the shares of the operator must be listed within two years of the effective date of the licence. This imposed a listing requirement by 15 December 2022 on Airtel Uganda. On 17 June 2022, the Uganda Communications Commission issued Airtel Uganda an extension of the listing obligation from 15 December 2022 to 16 December 2023 on condition that the prospectus is submitted to the capital markets authority for approval before 30 June 2023. Airtel Uganda is working towards the listing with advisors and is confident it will meet the required deadline. 24 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Spectrum assets in every country, with multiple layers of data capacity, including new 5G technology in six markets A modernised network offering 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G, largely on efficient single RAN technology 31,500 network towers and data capacity of 23,900 terabytes per day 70,500 km of fibre across our markets 4,000 employees Other key inputs and enablers: Compliance with regulatory frameworks in all markets A sound capital allocation strategy and financial management that targets revenue growth ahead of the market and underlying EBITDA margin improvement Mobile network partnerships that outsource the management and operation of our network infrastructure A strong management structure with operating companies in each market that can leverage Group expertise Our sustainability strategy which underpins everything we do.

We work with the governments and institutions of the countries in which we operate to develop and deliver our strategy - which helps them realise their goals for sustainable development while ensuring our strict and continued compliance with local laws and regulations. Win with data Win with people Win with cost Win with distribution T ransforming lives Win with technology Win with mobile money 28 Our strategy continued 28 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Win with technology We aim to create a leading, modernised network that provides the data capacity to meet rapidly growing demand and supports connectivity and digitalisation in our markets. That means improving basic network uptime, quality and resilience as well as expanding our network footprint and our 4G capabilities, while developing our 5G capacity in readiness for predicted 5G demand. To reflect the importance of IT capabilities and technology in reaching our customers, we renamed this pillar from 'Win with network' to 'Win with technology' this year. Our priorities Expanding the reach of 4G coverage and building capacity through our 2G 3G 4G approach Investing in 5G spectrum to make our network future-ready Focusing on rural coverage expansion through new site rollouts, recognising that access to a reliable service is the critical first step for reaching previously underserved communities Focusing on our network resilience and service continuity, and adding capacity through aggregation Building and modernising our network through optimal end-to-end design, including spectrum additions Our progress We continue to focus on delivering best-in-class service and 4G networks in our markets, while ensuring our network is ready for future 5G demand by investing in 5G spectrum and technological capabilities in key markets. Our goal is to be the market leader everywhere we operate, while continuing to include more people in our network, particularly in underserved rural areas. This year we made significant investments in our network, technology and spectrum, while maintaining our services in the face of challenges that included fuel price inflation and fuel shortages - we also made progress in initiatives with our suppliers to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce fuel dependency. As part of ensuring we are ready for 5G demand, in addition to purchasing spectrum we grew our fibre infrastructure and tested our 5G capabilities. We invested in data centres while exploring their potential for additional revenue streams from third-party users. We continued to improve our fibre provision in metro, intercity, and international networks, including through cost-effective partnerships and co-investment programmes. We increased data speeds as well as coverage. In addition to our KPIs, below, we track our progress by measures which include data consumption, which increased from 1.8 million terabytes to 2.6 million terabytes and the number of new sites in rural areas, a target that supports our sustainability strategy: this year we added 1,100 new sites in rural areas. How we measure progress We measure progress through several KPIs, described on pages 18-19, including: Total sites and data capacity: we deployed more than 2,700 additional sites, reaching 31,546 sites in total as of 31 March 2023. During the year, we added 3,200 more sites to 4G 90% of sites now on 4G and added an incremental 6,000 km of fibre 70,500 km of fibre as of March 2023. Data capacity increased by 41.2% to 23,900 terabytes TB per day, with peak hour data utilisation at 47.4%. In addition, 42.9% of our sites are in rural locations and our network availability is 99.61% as of 31 March 2023.

Our distribution network empowers our business by extending our brand and ability to offer inter-linked services, as well as through customer recruitment and retention. Our priorities Strengthening our distribution infrastructure to win more quality customers by increasing our depth and width, with a particular focus on rural areas Enhancing the customer's experience through simplified digital customer onboarding processes, including the Know Your Customer KYC process Cross-selling new digital services to our existing customer base Broadening our offer to enhance usage and ARPU, while further granulating our approach to distribution so we can focus faster and more responsively on the needs and issues of customers in smaller geographies, increasing our net customer reach. Our progress We have continued to expand our distribution network to get closer to customers and increase our visibility, developing our infrastructure and achieving net additions as reflected in the KPIs. Our physical distribution network remains key to our success, and we expanded our ecosystem of customer activation outlets from 251,000 to 304,000 this year, while consolidating the services we can offer at a single outlet. At the same time, we're enhancing our digital distribution capability to stay ahead of the penetration of smartphones, and we remain focused on MyAirtel app and other self-serve functionality. Fast, effective digital onboarding is also a continuing priority, bringing new customers to our service in ways that are 100% compliant with local Know Your Customer KYC requirements while being as efficient as possible, including by recording biometric information where this is a requirement. Through digital registration, most onboarding processes are achieved in five minutes or less. We tackled a number of challenges over the year. We addressed shortages of SIM cards in some markets by integrating SIM sales with onboarding and have enhanced our offer for e-SIM-capable smartphones. The increasing uptake of the MyAirtel app has helped mitigate currency shortages in some markets. As smartphone penetration increases and our 4G network expands, we expect further migration from voice to data services, and we look for further opportunities to recruit data customers, such as our partnership with New World TV in 2022, which enabled Airtel TV subscribers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC, Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Chad, Niger, Madagascar and the Seychelles to enjoy exclusive, live access to all FIFA World Cup 2022 matches. How we measure progress We measure distribution through several KPIs, described on pages 18-19, including: Customer base and net adds: our customer base grew by 9.0% to 140 million as of 31 March 2023. Customer activating outlets grew by 21.0% to 304,000. The overall growth reflects our investment in sales and distribution infrastructure, including our exclusive Airtel Money distribution channel of kiosks and branches. Our enhanced distribution channel ensures availability of SIM cards, recharge cards and money float. For more information about our principal risks, see pages 90-97 Zambia: delivering excellent execution to reach more customers Excellent execution is key to winning with distribution. Everywhere we operate we aim to increase our productivity, accelerate our subscriber growth and improve our market share. Across the Group, we focus on aligning our distribution and marketing campaigns, and continue to identify opportunities for productivity improvements in areas that are typically underserviced - what we call 'hyper-growth' opportunities, which can be rural or urban depending on local circumstances. This year, Airtel Zambia was a highperforming market, delivering on distribution by getting closer to customers - as of 31 March 2023, we had 189,000 distribution touchpoints recharge selling outlets and Airtel money agents across the country, an increase of 39.5% year-onyear, and 117,000 Airtel Money agents, an increase of 47.5%. Those distribution touchpoints are nurtured - we want people to want to work with us, so we'five built our employer brand and reward structure for the people who work for us directly, and people who earn through working with Airtel Zambia. Our team supervises the network carefully, visiting sites to check they have sufficient float, and helping our agents understand the business case for each Airtel Africa offering, so they can more effectively serve customers. Our ecosystem of distribution touchpoints is also carefully targeted: our cluster planning makes our distribution more efficient, and we aim to ensure customers can access SIM cards, recharge and mobile money at every site. Our My Airtel app is also playing a vital role in Zambia, as described on page 47. As a result, our revenue in Zambia grew by 32.4% in 2022 23, driving revenue growth for both data and mobile money services. Our customer base in Zambia grew by 15.1% to 8 million customers.

Evans Mulenga Lusaka, Zambia 30 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Our strategy continued STRATEGIC REPORT 31 The Democratic Republic of the Congo: demand for data resilient, even in challenging times Across our markets, demand for data continues to grow fast - even in a year in which many customers felt the pressure of fuel shortages and food price inflation. It shows that if we can stay ahead through the strength of our technology and distribution networks, there is clear potential for future growth. In the DRC, for example, we were able to grow our 4G data customer base by 37.5% to 1.9 million and increase 4G customer penetration as a percentage of our total data customer base to 47.5% - this means that alsmost half of our data customers are using 4G technology in the DRC. This growth in customers came at a time of significant data demand. To support this expansion, we reinforced our 4G network, which added 280 sites in the DRC over the year, while strengthening our ability to get close to customers through our distribution system. Boosting our smartphone offer through competitive pricing has also played an important role in the DRC, alongside the reliability of our network - and we took steps to widen our supplier base and increase the frequency of supplies. These investments have paid off: our total data usage in the DRC increased by 63% to 183.2 million GB.

That means encouraging smartphone ownership and increasing data usage at scale, while increasing access to the digital economy for customers in all our markets. Our priorities Leveraging our 4G network for data ARPU and revenue growth and using our technology to win and or maintain market leadership Investing in 5G capabilities to be ready for future demand Smartphone offerings for all new handsets through well-priced, transparent bundles Further developing our wireless home broadband business Developing innovative products and data solutions for corporate and SME customers through Airtel Business Continuing to focus on data security for our customers in line with our sustainability strategy Our progress Driving success in our 'Win with data' pillar is closely linked to our ability to extend and maintain fast, reliable networks, and to being close to our customers through our distribution organisation. This year we saw the number of data customers rise to 54.6 million alongside the expansion of our 4G network and the continued increase in broadband customers. Our data capacity grew rapidly to 23,900 TB per day, and we added 3,200 4G sites to our network, which means we're including more people than ever, as well as offering higher speeds and capacity. Our investment in 5G spectrum and capabilities in Kenya, Nigeria and Zambia ensures we will be ready to meet 5G demand. The strong presence of our outlets and our marketing investment support this network advantage. To keep customers' data secure, we now hold certification in 'Information Security Management System' ISO 27001, and 'Business Continuity Management System' ISO 22301, which cover all mobile communication and mobile money operations in all our markets. While the rate of smartphone penetration growth slowed this year in many markets as consumers faced cost-ofliving pressures, we continued to recruit smartphone users, driven by innovative products and partnerships with smartphone sellers. A range of offers and products drove increased usage, including Airtel TV. Overall, data usage grew by 46.3%, demonstrating the strength of demand. How we measure progress We measure data through several KPIs, described on pages 18-19, including: Data customers, 4G data customers and penetration. Our data customer base increased by 16.9% to 54.6 million as of 31 March 2023, and now constitutes 39.0% of our total customer base. Our total data usage increased by 46.3% to 2.6 million TB. Data usage per customer per month reached 4.4 GB, an increase of 29.1%. 4G data usage contributed 74.5% to total data usage. Data revenue grew by 23.8% and data ARPU was $3.0, up by 9.3% in constant currency.

Our priorities Further strengthening our distribution channel of kiosks, mini shops and dedicated Airtel Money branches, so customers can access assured float and cash Build and scale Airtel Money across all our markets Continuing to recruit customers from our mobile services base using recharge as an enabler Make Airtel Money the currency of choice by expanding our mobile money portfolio through additional mobile money services, including merchant payments Enterprise and digital payments, including commercial payments, benefit transfers, loans and savings Developing our fintech services as we move towards providing platform services loans and international money transfers Focusing on technology as an enabler and competitive advantage Our progress We have widened our customer base and driven increased revenues while substantially increasing the reach and depth of our mobile money offer. We continue to focus on our distribution network and float availability through our Airtel Money branches, which expanded by 11.5% in 2022 23, and kiosks, which increased by 10.8%. We also increased the number of multi-brand agents in our network by 44%. This has resulted in the growth of our customer base to 31.5 million and we encourage female customers who are historically underserved by financial services in many of our markets to use our financial products and services. We continue to use recharges as an enabler for recruiting customers from our mobile services base. We have invested in our technology and our people to ensure we have the capabilities and skills we need to increase Airtel Money's acceptance as the currency of choice across the financial ecosystem. Among other metrics, this has seen the value of international money transfers increase by 33.7%. At the same time, we began to gear up our offering in Nigeria following the granting of our Payment Service Bank PSB licence by the Central Bank of Nigeria in April 2022. How we measure progress We measure mobile money progress through several KPIs, described on pages 18-19, including: Airtel Money customer base and penetration: our Airtel Money customer base grew by 20.4% to 31.5 million.

Our 'quick loan' product is designed to do just that - helping customers make payments when and where they want to, reducing the number of failed transactions, and smoothing the mobile money experience. We introduced quick loans after spotting the number of failed transactions that resulted from customers having insufficient funds in their mobile wallets to cover the transaction value or their fees. We offer a one-time instant loan to cover the fee or value, up to their credit limit. The loan attracts a low fee, and is available for buying goods and services, paying bills, buying airtime, or money transfers - whatever the customer needs. The product has rapidly become very popular in markets such as Uganda, which was among the first to pilot it. Demand in Uganda had reached $7.9m per month by March 2023 - often driven by customers such as micro-traders who choose to buy their stock in the morning and repay their loan in the evening after trading. The 866,000 quick loans taken up by 254,000 customers in Uganda have opened up new financial inclusion opportunities for young enterepreneurs like Ivan Baguma who runs his health supplements business in Kampala. It has also helped to drive 20.5% Airtel Money revenue growth in Uganda in 2022 23.

In October 2022 we launched our 'Women in Tech' programme to help ensure that our most promising female talent - those who scored high performance marks in several consecutive years - contribute their skills and expertise to key projects. The 12-month programme focuses on business challenges in the digital and tech space - with participants working together to identify and design complete business solutions that address some of our biggest opportunities. The 58 women taking part in our first programme are being mentored by senior leaders and female Board members and will present their proposals and business plans to our executive team at the end of their training. 'Paying it forward': inspiring the female talent of tomorrow This programme is open to any highperforming woman working in areas with a strong technical focus and aims to accelerate participants' career potential through training in design thinking, problem identification and problem solving, and presentation skills. It reflects our commitment to providing opportunities and support to female employees as part of building gender equality in our workforce. It is also an example of our 'pay it forward' philosophy, because the participants in the course are already inspiring and mentoring other talented women in our business, including through a global seminar on International Women's Day in March 2023.

This enables us to build large incremental capacity at low marginal cost. Our priorities Our cost-efficiency initiatives, which seek to optimise site operational and maintenance expenses, and bandwidth cost A detailed analysis of expenses with the aim of improving operating margins in individual markets Ensuring fail-safe network design with optimal cost structures, for example through multiple fibre routes and high-capacity indefeasible right of usage IRUs Increasing availability of digital recharges and self-care services Our progress The aim of our cost model is to ensure that we can provide substantial additional capacity to serve our customers in all our markets, at marginal additional cost. We do this through optimising our network design, a constant focus on value in our inputs and our contracts, and volume optimisation. This year, rapid increases in the cost of the fuel we need to run our sites placed significant pressure on our cost base, while devaluations and currency shortages in some markets also created headwinds. SIM card price increases added to costs. However, we were able to maintain underlying EBITDA margins at broadly similar levels to 2021 22 thanks to a range of cost initiatives, including close collaboration with suppliers. We continue to look for areas where we can share costs and increase our operational resilience while improving our offer to customers - for example, by exploring options for partnerships on fibre or data centre resources. How we measure progress Underlying EBITDA for 2022 23 was $2,575m, up by 17.3% in constant currency.

We have continued to focus on talent, capability and technology to bring the best out of our people and deliver the best results for the business, and our Group's overall results in the face of global and local headwinds this year demonstrate that we are on the right track. In 2022 23 we continued to apply a 'build or buy' succession strategy, and our internal development programmes resulted in a 42% internal promotions into new or existing roles, while we also reduced our 'time-to-hire' time significantly. Our Airtel Africa mobility programme, designed to support talent development and skills transfer across the Group, enabled high-potential employees to deepen their skills and enhance experience through cross-functional, cross-border roles. Our gender diversity stands at 26% women in our workforce, and we launched our 'Women in Tech' programme to further develop our pipeline of female talent. As our ways of working are underpinned by a strong governance framework, we also built our people's understanding of the Code of Conduct through a mandatory refresher training course available in English and French, and ensured all new hires were trained in our global Code of Conduct. Digitalisation is an important part of our approach, and we continued to develop our digital learning platforms and expand the ways in which we engage with employees. Our employee engagement survey continues to provide us with regular insight and feedback from our people. Further details of our engagement and programmes, including our employee assistance programme, are on pages 44 and 45 in the stakeholder section. How we measure progress We measure our progress on people through a number of KPIs, including: Diversity - by gender 26% women in our workforce, 29% women in ExCo at the OpCo level and nationality employees from 39 nationalities. Skills development - we delivered key functional and leadership training through accelerated on-demand learning programmes, which in return improved productivity and overall performance. Employee engagement - our bi-annual employee engagement survey achieved a 91% response rate in 2022 23, a 4% improvement from 2020 21 engagement level, with an overall engagement score of 81% which is a 2% increase from the previous score.

It also provides full data and detailed updates on our progress against our goals and targets, including specific information on our sustainability governance and partnerships. In both our sustainability strategy and the Sustainability Report 2022, we committed to full transparency in our reporting and to regular and timely updates on our progress. Ahead of the publication of our next Sustainability Report in 2024, we're taking this opportunity to provide our stakeholders with a summary of our  work over the last six months. Our sustainability strategy framework A clear framework is essential to ensure that we remain focused on the delivery of every aspect of our strategy and to provide clarity in our reporting. Our materiality assessment identified a broad range of topics relevant to our entire business - these are vital, and addressing the challenges will support our company's purpose to transform lives for people, families, communities and businesses across the African continent. Our framework also provides a structured approach for the programmes which are implemented in our 14 markets.

Our ambition is to increase digital inclusion across the continent through the expansion and increased reliability of our network, to keep our customers' data safe and protected at all times, and to ensure our entire value chain adheres to our ESG principles. Our data security goal Our commitment is to guarantee that our data privacy and security controls are among the best in the world. It is our highest priority material topic. Our goal is to establish industry-leading data security for our customers. We will achieve this through investment in technology and expertise, updated processes, and consumer awareness, delivered through programmes with clear targets and timelines. MATERIAL TOPIC: DATA SECURITY attack. We have also published comprehensive online safety information on all our consumer-facing websites to help customers protect their digital identities and personal information. To complement a redesign of our vulnerability management programme, in February 2023 we appointed an independent partner to test for weaknesses in our external facing assets. We have also upgraded our privilege access management solution which ensures no unauthorised access to data. This work has been completed in January 2023. We have put Group-wide cybersecurity insurance in place to reduce our exposure to the impact of any unsolicited and unwanted cybersecurity events. In addition, as part of our security incident management implementation, we enhanced our process to provide a robust response in case of any security attack. Our dedicated 24 7 security team is responsible for continuously monitoring 'attack surface' to stop breaches by minimising risk from exposed assets and involve relevant stakeholders, as necessary. We also engaged an external security organisation, which monitors for cyber attacks and can respond to incidents when needed. For more information on our principal risks, see pages 90-97. We updated our ransomware protection policy Ransomware is when malicious attackers encrypt an organisation's data and demand payment to restore access. In February 2023 we updated our ransomware protection policy to guard against this growing cyberthreat. This policy is designed to minimise and manage the risks associated with ransomware attacks on Airtel Africa. The updated policy sets out the mechanisms we have in place to identify our risk of a ransomware attack, and the controls around people, process and technology we will implement if a risk is detected. Pillar 1 Our business Our data security in action Information security week - raising awareness among employees Information security is a key focus area for us and our stakeholders - and we know it needs to be a shared responsibility for everyone at Airtel Africa. In February 2023, we launched our internal information security awareness week in three of our markets, helping our employees understand best security practices so they can help us reduce the possibility of service outages due to security incidents, data breaches, potential financial losses and reputational damage. During the week, interactive events and activities in Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia focused on awareness activities and information security training, with online quizzes and contests to bring security messages to life, and 'cyber-mascots' who toured our offices to deliver spot quizzes. We'five seen a rapid increase in awareness in the markets where the awareness week was launched - and will extend the scheme to other markets in 2023 24. 84 external security tests 16% increase in number of security applications and platforms 1,475 people trained during 'phishing' simulation We aim to establish an internal control framework that aligns with industry standards and create internal capability to reduce our dependency on partners. We recognise our responsibility to provide customers with best-in-class protection for their personal and financial information. Our focus areas: Confidentiality - protecting information from being exposed to unauthorised parties and keeping sensitive information private. Integrity - ensuring the constant reliability of our data, networks and systems. Availability - ensuring authorised users have access to the systems, networks and data they need, and resolving hardware and software conflicts to build design resilience. Certification has been a key focus for us in the last six months. In addition to preparing for the second annual audit of our ISO 27001 ISMS and ISO 22301 BCMS certification, in November 2022 we started working towards ISO certification for SmartCash PSB Payment Service Bank Nigeria. These standards are vital in helping us establish a robust management framework and ensuring business and operational continuity. We have also introduced an industryleading 'email gateway solution' which will manage and filter all inbound and outbound email traffic to protect our organisation from email-borne threats and data leaks. We anticipate this will be fully rolled out by the end of 2023. To help our people and partners keep their information secure, in December 2022 we conducted a phishing simulation and have made training available to all employees and suppliers to reduce the risk of an STRATEGIC REPORT 41 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Our service quality goal Our goal is to provide underserved communities with access to reliable network and connectivity across our 14 markets. Providing network accessibility to rural areas is key to building digital inclusion. We will achieve it through the rollout of new infrastructure sites and technology, improved fibre connectivity and capacity delivered through programmes with clear targets and timelines. MATERIAL TOPIC: SERVICE QUALITY We aim to create a leading, modernised network that can provide data capacity to meet rapidly growing demand and enhance connectivity and digitalisation in our markets. By expanding our network, we're helping to build digital inclusion for communities across Africa. Our focus areas: Accessibility - increasing the percentage of the population in each of our markets - including in rural areas - who have access to our services. Delivery - increasing the availability of our latest technology service offerings and products to all our customers. Reliability - ensuring our customers have access to reliable connectivity and high bandwidth capacity. Over the last six months, we have expanded rural coverage through new site rollouts and site modernisations to ensure uninterrupted network resilience and service continuity. We continued to deploy optimal end-to-end design, including spectrum additions in several markets, latest RAN radio access network technology and fibre rollout, and best-in-class voice service quality. At the close of our financial year, over 79.45% of the population in our markets had access to our network and over 65.88% of the population was covered by 4G. This is in line with the rollout timeline we had set. We're also readying the business for 5G demand. Alongside acquiring 5G spectrum, we had made preparations for 5G launch in Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia and Tanzania by 31 March 2023. Work is underway to prepare for the launch of 5G in another two markets in 2023 24. Expansion of coverage Total sites 31,546 Sites with 3G 30,866 Sites with 4G 28,476 Not only does 5G provide optimal service to our customers, it was also designed - from its inception - to be highly energy efficient. Moving data over 5G uses 90% less energy than LTE long-term evolution and 5G workloads can be uploaded to the cloud where any associated emissions become the shared responsibility of the entire value chain. As part of our sustainability strategy, we have set a commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Energy efficiency - and the contribution of 5G - is a critical consideration in this.

Razvan Ungureanu Chief technology and information officer Our sustainability strategy continued Our service quality in action Our supply chain management goal Our goal is to ensure all our suppliers are aligned with our ESG principles. Our stakeholders hold us accountable for this and we expect our suppliers to uphold high standards in human and labour rights, environmental performance as well as business ethics. We maintain that there is no place for the abuse of employee rights, violations of legislation, regulation or governance standards, or environmental negligence in our supply chain. MATERIAL TOPIC: SUPPLY CHAIN As a responsible organisation, we look further than our own business and we aim to drive change and positive improvement through our entire value chain. Our goal is to ensure all our suppliers are aligned with our ESG criteria, upholding high standards in human rights, labour rights, environmental performance and business ethics. Our focus areas are: Enhanced due diligence - increasing the pre-contract disclosures we expect of potential vendors and suppliers. Ongoing ESG compliance - reviewing the ESG standards, policies and controls of existing vendors and suppliers. In the six months from October 2022, our main priority was to maintain an ongoing supply of equipment, fuel and services despite the geopolitical turbulence and shortages caused by the residual impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Over that period, we continued to increase our supplier base with contracts awarded to new suppliers or vendors while improving onboarding process. Work has started on the development of ESG disclosure requirements for new suppliers and we anticipate that this will be incorporated into our onboarding process by Q4'24. We also focused on existing suppliers and undertook a detailed analysis of the results from an ESG self-assessment questionnaire ESG SAQ which was sent to our top 100 suppliers and vendors by procurement spend in September 2022 to gather information on their ESG standards, processes and policies. With the response rate of 79%, we were in a good position to carry out detailed analysis of the feedback we received. With this analysis in place, we're now developing a robust self-certification process for suppliers and vendors which we will introduce in 2023 24. For more information about our 'Win with cost' strategy, see page 36 Providing better services for more customers in Kenya During the reporting period in Kenya we focused on ensuring our 4G network is ready to sustain our customers with 5G technology tomorrow - to do so, in July 2022 we acquired 60 MHz in the 2600 MHz spectrum band for a period of 15 years. And we have already made 56 sites 5G-ready as of 31 March 2023. To further increase our capability, we deployed 350 additional infrastructure sites reaching the total number of 3,163 sites as of 31 March 2023. We also laid out 900 km of fibre reaching a total of 8,900 km in 2022 23. As a result, data capacity increased by 82.7% to 3,047 terabytes TB per day, with peak hour data utilisation at 43%. Overall, in Kenya we cover 85% of rural population and approximately 46% of our sites are in remote areas. For more information about our 'Win with technology'strategy, see page 28 STRATEGIC REPORT 43 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 What we learnt from our suppliers: key findings from our ESG SAQ General sustainability commitments and policies Environmental Social Governance 96% of suppliers who responded to our ESG SAQ have established a code of conduct 92% have a grievance mechanism in place 80% have an ESG framework or policy 64% have publicly committed to sustainability through their policies or sustainability reporting 80% have recycling schemes and waste reduction initiatives 53% track energy consumption and conduct on-site energy audits 34% measure scope 1, 2 and or 3 greenhouse gas emissions 32% have GHG emission reduction goals and targets 94% define their approach to labour and health and safety standards 91 % have policies that prohibit child or forced labour 96% have policies that prohibit workplace harassment 100% provide health and safety training to employees 86% conduct annual health and safety audits 73% invest in community development projects 96% have anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies and procedures 94% have data security systems 95% undertake regular stakeholder engagement 49% monitor ESG performance of suppliers 35% require suppliers to publicly disclose ESG data We're pleased to work in true partnership with our suppliers and vendors to drive improved environmental and social performance throughout the entire industry. Ramakrishna Lella Chief supply chain officer Engagement with our top tier partners Engaging our partners, vendors and suppliers in the delivery of our sustainability goals is critical. Scope 3 emissions account for over 80% of our total GHG emissions, and it is vital we work in partnership to develop robust decarbonisation programmes and initiatives across our value chain. In March 2023, we completed 'deep dive' consultations with our top tier partners, who account for 78% of our scope 3 emissions. Our aim was to communicate our sustainability strategy goals with a particular focus on the reduction of GHG emissions. The consultation revealed that while our top tier partners are at very different stages of developing their decarbonisation plans - from those that have set net zero targets to those who are just starting to address emissions - they are deploying significant resources to their decarbonisation ambitions. We're pleased that our partners have committed to enhancing disclosure of their GHG emissions data to help us accurately monitor and report our scope 3 emissions. Membership of the Joint Audit Corporation JAC Airtel Africa is a member of the Joint Audit Corporation JAC which represents telecoms service providers, most of whom have vendors and suppliers in common. JAC will undertake on-site audits of five of our suppliers each year. In the six months from October 2022, we identified the suppliers and sites to be audited under the JAC guidance. These audits will take place by the end of 2023 24. JAC verifies and assesses implementation of ESG-related programmes across the leading suppliers to the ICT industry. Furthermore, JAC members collaborate to ensure best practice in the shared value chain, and we support corrective programmes that JAC encourage to improve ESG standards. This membership will allow us to implement and enhance a periodic audit process for vendors and suppliers to monitor their compliance with our ESG criteria. 81% employee engagement survey scores 27.5% female representation across 14 OpCos 29% gender diversity of our leadership in 14 OpCos $1.1m total investment into training and development programmes in 2022 23 31% gender diversity of our Board of directors 229,660 total learning hours in 2022 23 39 nationalities in our workforce 0% total recordable injury frequency rate TRIFR 44 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Our sustainability strategy continued Our commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive workforce We continue to draw upon our broad range of policies, programmes and engagement initiatives to help us achieve this goal. We are committed to delivering equality in our workforce. We will achieve this through recruitment and programmes to provide training and advancement for everyone regardless of gender, nationality or disability. MATERIAL TOPIC: DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION Our people are critical to the delivery of our business and sustainability strategy. Without our dedicated and talented workforce, we would not be able to achieve our growth objectives or deliver on our corporate purpose of transforming lives. Our commitment is to provide rewarding employment opportunities and a workplace where everyone can thrive and develop. This goes to the heart of who we are. Our commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive workforce Increasing female representation throughout the organisation is a key focus for us. Over the past six months, we have appointed several women into senior level roles, including the finance director of Airtel Niger and the Group head of digital, both of whom were recruited externally. Providing opportunities for our own people is important, and we're delighted that a female employee has been promoted into the role of Group head of tax. In addition, we have worked with our recruitment consultancies across all 14 markets to ensure more female candidates are put forward for interviews. Pillar 2 Our people Our commitment to people in action Mentoring and creativity helping Kenya win with people Winning with people is vital in all our markets - because bringing the best out of our workforce lets our people fulfil their talent while driving our business success. In markets where there's strong competition for talented people, we have to be particularly creative to win. This year, our annual 'Win with people' prize was awarded to Airtel Kenya, a highly competitive market where our teams have delivered a range of training and initiatives designed to improve retention in our workforce, keep our brand visible, and engage employees. Developing high-potential employees through e-learning courses, leadership training and job-shadowing helps keep our talent pipeline flowing. In addition, Airtel Kenya's internship programme welcomed 20 interns to undertake projects across the business. Detailed mapping of the talent pool and well-executed onboarding programmes helped Airtel Kenya recruit 200 sales executives in two months. Airtel Kenya is also delivering on our gender diversity ambitions. The OpCo's workforce is 40% female as of 31 March 2023, and 50% of the leadership team are women. Airtel Kenya is always looking for new ways to develop female talent: this year the mentorship programme run in partnership with 'Girls for girls' saw 12 female employees mentored and three mentors trained over a six-month course, with participants reporting positive changes in their confidence outlook and understanding of the opportunities they have to contribute to Airtel Africa. Empowering all our employees is essential to winning with people - and we'five focused on recruiting and developing high-potential employees to help nurture our high-performance culture. Ashish Malhotra Managing director, Airtel Kenya STRATEGIC REPORT 45 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Airtel Africa is creating a culture and developing opportunities for women to nurture their talents and secure their futures. We are determined to improve gender equality across the continent. Rogany Ramiah Chief human resources officer Provision of best practice training and development Over the past six months, we have continued to build opportunities for our people to develop their careers through a range of online and in-person training and development programmes. These programmes focus on leadership and functional training and are designed to improve career mobility. We have also updated Percipio, our online learning platform, to offer a personalised, immersive learning experience, including virtual workshops and access to relevant professional certifications. Since October 2022, more than 300 leaders have completed our 'Agile culture' course, and more than 5,300 employees and contractors have taken functional courses on Percipio, Xelerate and other online learning platforms. Developing the next generation of women leaders in technology is vital for us. We currently have 58 women on our 'Women in Tech' programme, all of whom are being mentored by senior executives. We anticipate this programme will accelerate in 2023 24. For more information about this programme, see our strategic pillar 'Win with people' on page 37 Our commitment to maintaining a healthy and safe work environment Our human resources and facilities teams work together to maintain a healthy and safe work environment for every one of our employees. This is reviewed monthly by the Sustainability Committee. Our human resources teams also work closely with internal audit and assurance to guarantee a continuous focus on health and safety in the workplace in line with our recently updated health, safety and security policy. In addition, we continue to focus on the individual health and safety of our employees through a partnership with our health insurer. This includes wellness check-ups, 24 7 access to medical advice and support for mental wellness. Engaging with our employees In March 2023, we held the Group leadership conclave in Dubai which was attended by senior executives from 14 OpCos. An important focus of the session was our 'Win with people' strategy: we addressed the Board mandate for building on our work to increase diversity and inclusion, and how to embed our unique ways of working and commitment to our people. This year's leadership conclave was attended by around 250 leaders, a significant increase from previous years: we broadened the participation and included more managerlevel participants. The three-day session allowed us to discuss our annual operations planning AOP and also enabled our Chair and leadership to interact with managers and employees from 14 OpCos and HQ. In addition, chairpersons from our OpCo Boards attended and took the opportunity to engage with teams across the organisation and share insights into our culture and values. A plenary session was dedicated to our sustainability strategy and vision. The conclave was highly immersive, and all teams had an opportunity to engage with the senior leadership of the organisation as well as the Chair in person. Furthermore, we took time to award and recognise top-performing teams and individuals at the gala event. In addition, we organised several 'open mic' sessions, including a session with the Chair and the CEO during the closing remarks. For more information about our 'Win with people' strategy, see page 37 Celebrating International Women's Day across Africa We celebrated International Women's Day in March 2023 for the third consecutive year, supporting equality, diversity and inclusion-related initiatives and campaigns across our 14 markets. We adopted the UN Women's theme for this year: 'DigitALL: innovation and technology for gender equality'. Employees took part in talks, debates and activities to recognise our growing female workforce across the Group and to consider some of the barriers and challenges facing women in the workplace. We held a Group-wide town hall led by our CEO to recognise the contribution of women at Airtel Africa and to the wider community. There could not have been a better theme given today's global reality where technology underpins the way we live, work and play. I look forward to working together with Airtel Africa women to innovate and design new ideas for a brighter future. Olusegun Ogunsanya Chief executive officer Our commitment to people in action 46 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Our sustainability strategy continued Our digital inclusion goal We are committed to improving the footprint of our network, and thereby offering higher coverage of populations across urban and rural markets. Our goal is to significantly improve digital inclusion across Africa. We will do this by driving penetration of mobile telephony, smartphones and home broadband in rural areas through the provision of retail and support services. This will be key to addressing the digital divide. MATERIAL TOPIC: DIGITAL INCLUSION The availability and affordability of our products and services are critical to driving digital inclusion. By expanding our network, we're providing people with the opportunity to use telephony and internet services, often for the very first time, and increasing digital inclusion across Africa. But opportunity alone is not enough: consumers also need access to the products and services that enable them to take advantage of this opportunity. Our focus areas: Rural penetration - increased penetration of mobile telephony in rural areas is a vital first step towards digital inclusion. For people to buy, use and understand their devices and digital services they must have access to local retail and customer support. Affordability - encouraging use of our full range of digital services through the creation of more attractive and affordable options for home broadband and smartphone purchases. Payment solutions - in pre-paid markets, the availability of digital services is dependent upon the availability of credit. We work to expand and develop more convenient payment solutions for our customers so that they're able to access digital services as and when they need to. There has been a significant improvement in data capacity through the expansion of our network coverage and data availability. The continued rollout of new sites and upgrade of existing sites to 4G has increased the number of people in Africa who can now access the 4G network, especially in rural areas. Our rural population coverage stands at 70% as of 31 March 2023. We have also been encouraging customer uptake with the launch of data bundle offers designed specifically to appeal to the needs of customers in each market, with additional add-on offers available to existing users through the MyAirtel app - adoption of our data bundles grew by 3.5% to 94.7%. Pillar 3 Our community Supporting communities across Africa is - and has always been - at the heart of our organisation. Our ambition is to drive digital and financial inclusion and access to education for people and communities across the continent through the provision of data and mobile services delivered through our network expansion. These are vital to the positive transformation of lives across Africa. Employee assistance programme delivers after cyclones in Malawi Cyclone Freddy struck Madagascar and Malawi in February and March 2023, causing devastating loss of life and damage to property and infrastructure. Alongside our efforts to support customers and communities through our network, we also supported our people - especially the 17 colleagues who lost their homes in the cyclone. Airtel Africa funded temporary accommodation while they awaited resettlement into new homes, and the 'Airtel ladies' welfare group, which is wholly employee-driven, organised donations of clothes, bedding, appliances and non-perishable food items to be sent to the employees and their families. The cyclone was followed by an outbreak of cholera in Malawi, and we moved fast to protect our people in the affected southern region, suspending all but critical travel, and keeping employees updated through health and safety communications. Launching Airtel Women Network in Nigeria In March 2023, we launched a programme called 'Airtel Women's Network' to encourage women to play an active role in technology and empower them to become global leaders. Through this platform, we support Airtel Africa women through mentorship and networking - to be able to pitch ideas, access the resources and participate in key technology projects. This initiative is aligned with our commitment to increase gender diversity, and financial and digital inclusion in Africa. Our people commitment in action STRATEGIC REPORT 69% sites with exclusive outlets 70% population covered in rural areas 46% digital recharge contribution to overall recharges 36% smartphone penetration 0.5% home broadband penetration 47 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Transforming lives in action According to the International Telecommunication Union ITU, globally, 57% of women use the internet compared with 62% of men. Of the estimated 2.7 billion people worldwide currently unconnected, the majority are women and girls. We're addressing the digital gender divide by offering affordable and easy-to-use products, such as 'binge bundles' offering high benefits at a lower price with limited validity which allow people on lower income, typically women, to access data. This contributes to unlocking women's potential in the digital economy. Since the internet has become part of everyday lives, our customers use it to work or for entertainment, and children use it to study and access learning platforms on their devices. In March 2023, we launched a new home broadband unlimited product in the Seychelles, the first of its kind, which allows customers to use wireless connectivity by just plugging in their device and browsing at a full 4G speed. Schoolchildren will also benefit from faster speed and ease of access to educational content. We plan to roll out the same home broadband proposition in other markets where we also launch 5G coverage in 2023 24. We recognise that certain unmissable televised events can encourage otherwise undecided consumers to take the first step to getting online. We have partnered with FIFA to provide our customers with access to televised global football matches. Sport might bring customers to our services and products, but we're confident that the wider benefits will prove transformational to their lives and futures. For more information about our 'Win with data' strategy, see page 32 DRC: supporting digitalisation through the National Digital Library Supporting digitalisation is a central element of our strategy everywhere we operate - and in many markets, we work with government partners who also recognise the importance of access to data for individuals and the economy as a whole. In the DRC, the government's Plan National du Numerique is a country-wide vision of a new digital economy. We're supporting this through the provision of free WiFi to universities harnessing the strength of our 3G and 4G networks to deliver high-speed, quality data in partnership with the Ministry of Higher and University Education Ministere fide l'Enseignement Superieur et Universitaire. The newly created Bibliotheque Numerique Nationale National Digital Library was launched in 2022 to improve the quality of academic training. It provides students with access to academic resources hosted in the Ministry's data centre located at CEDESURK library as well as other universities' sites. With more than 160 resource providers, including the Francophone University Agency AUF, it's opening the door to a new world of digital education opportunities. Digital inclusion in action Zambia: MyAirtel app boosts distribution and accelerates digital penetration In Zambia, the rapid uptake of MyAirtel app, the self-care service, has been central to an overall drive on distribution that is tailored to meet the needs of Zambian customers - and which has seen growth of MyAirtel app active users by 186% in the market this year. Airtel Zambia researched why and how customers used the app and followed up with a marketing campaign that focused on what customers found most important - for example, checking transactions, accuracy in sending and receiving money or paying bills. MyAirtel app was downloaded 1.3 million times in Zambia by the end of the year, and our active users almost trebled from 162,000 to 465,000. 48 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Our sustainability strategy continued Our financial inclusion goal Financial inclusion is key to driving equality and economic growth Our goal is to significantly increase financial inclusion in Africa - with particular support for women. We do this through the development of affordable financial products to meet the needs of the unand underbanked, a reliable service which builds financial confidence and literacy. MATERIAL TOPIC: FINANCIAL INCLUSION Financial inclusion is key to driving equality and economic growth. Financial inclusion is a main driver to alleviate poverty and a critical goal of our sustainability strategy. Our focus areas: Affordability - developing products and services that meet the needs of the unand under-banked is crucial. Accessibility - ensuring our products and services are available when and where our customers need them. Awareness - empowering consumers with the knowledge, tools and confidence to use financial products responsibly. In the past six months, our work to improve financial inclusion has developed through several programmes which have resulted in an increased uptake and use of digital payments. In the year to March 2023, we have seen the value of transactions per Airtel Money subscriber increase by 16.4% as a result of the launch of a number of new products and an increased presence in our markets. We understand that being near our customers helps drive uptake of our products which, in turn, positively impacts financial inclusion. Over the last year we have increased our 'points of presence' - Airtel Money locations where customers can access services - by 44%, with a 12% increase in Airtel Money branches and an 11% increase in the number of kiosks. We have further supported this through investment in the technology infrastructure behind our developer, biller and enterprise portals. This underpins our merchant business, which extends our footprint by enabling customers to bank and access savings, loans and insurance products at merchant sites. We have also expanded our international money transfer corridors, allowing customers to send and receive money faster and to and from more destinations. 31.5m Airtel Money customer base $2.0 average revenue per user ARPU 22.5% mobile money customer base penetration $252 transaction value per customer per month Accelerating philanthropy in Nigeria In 2022 Airtel Nigeria reaffirmed its commitment to empower and support underprivileged people across communities in our largest market at the start of the seventh edition of the flagship philanthropy programme 'Airtel touching lives'. In just over a month, 100,300 requests for support were received, recorded and processed. In line with our sustainability strategy, we focused on causes and opportunities aimed at bridging the digital gender divide, financial inclusion and the adoption of schools in 2022 23. For example, we partnered with The Whispering Hope Africa, a non-profit organisation which supports women, children and entrepreneurs in rural communities and provided 65 girls with fully paid tuition fees for one year, including a donation of 12 portable computers and a photocopier machine to enable learning. Empowering women and girls plays an important part in our strategy for digital and financial inclusion - which is why we have also provided vital support to the Women's Technology Empowerment Centre W. TEC, an NGO which builds IT capabilities having worked successfully with more than 1,500 women and girls in Nigeria over the past 14 years. In June 2022, Airtel Nigeria supported their work - which was threatened by electricity supply shortages - by donating solar panels and cell batteries to help keep the project running. At the same time, we supplied laptops and other IT equipment to foster their aim of achieving economic empowerment through technology. During the sixth season of our 'Touching lives' programme, Airtel Nigeria has contributed N161,304, 000.00 equivalent of $350,000 to good causes for the benefit of the communities. Touching lives in action STRATEGIC REPORT 49 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 The economic empowerment of women has been, and will remain, a focus for us. Across our markets, most informal businesses are run and managed by women who, traditionally, do not have the same access to credit as men. We continue to offer our financial products and services to all customers, regardless of their gender. We work hard to encourage women to join our network and use our services, and to learn about our products that will provide them with independence and empowerment. We have also focused on promoting household savings through innovative deposit products. For example, in March 2023, Airtel Tanzania partnered with Letshego Bank for a digital savings campaign that will see mobile money customers win prizes, such as motorcycles, flat-screen TVs and cash. This innovative product encourages Airtel Money customers and the public to make savings digitally. For more information about our 'Win with mobile money' strategy, see page 33 Partnerships in action Financial Inclusion Fund the Hustler Fund initiative in Kenya Partnering with governments to help drive digital and financial inclusion is an important part of our strategy - and one of the ways we help transform lives. In November 2022, we joined the Kenyan government's Financial Inclusion Fund initiative - the Hustler Fund - which focuses on extending lending and savings for smalland medium-size enterprises, many of which are run by women. More than 19 million people have registered to access the Hustler Fund nationally and Airtel Money had disbursed KES 500 m equivalent of $3.67m through the fund delivering services to over a million transacting customers as of 31 March 2023. Our financial inclusion in action Supporting women entrepreneurs through financial inclusion in Kenya Lucie Saulinah Omondi is the founder of LiveGreatAgriLife in Nairobi, Kenya, a peanut butter factory and drinking water purification shop. She uses Airtel Money services to help run her business. \"Our business is located in Kibera, the largest informal settlement in Nairobi, where access to clean drinking water and quality food can be a challenge. We are committed to providing our community with delicious and nutritious peanut butter, peanut butter products and safe drinking water. Our peanut butter is made from high-quality locally sourced peanuts, and is available in a variety of sizes and tastings. Our drinking water is purified using state-of-the-art filtration systems, ensuring that it is safe and healthy to drink. As a socially responsible business, we're proud to support a foundation that works to uplift the settlement area where we operate. \" \"In four years of learning and overcoming challenges and slow but steady growth, I have been able to build a dedicated team and we're currently focusing on our online sales. I have to say Airtel Money's product is a huge support in collecting money for our produce and services. \" We continue getting closer to our customers to ensure that they can always reach us when needed. In Kenya, our Airtel Money branches grew by 50.3%, kiosks by 66.5% and the number of agents increased by 189.7% in 2022 23, providing support to valued customers like Lucie Saulinah Omondi. Our access to education goal We are committed to transforming lives through access to quality education. Our goal is to transform the lives of over one million children through education by 2027. MATERIAL TOPIC: EDUCATION AND DIGITAL LITERACY Providing access to quality education is central to our corporate purpose and philosophy. We believe education is the key to transforming lives and the futures of young people across Africa. We have set ourselves the goal of transforming the lives of over one million children on the continent through education by 2027. We will achieve this goal through three focused activity programmes. Partnerships - we are committed to working in collaboration to increase access to quality education. Our landmark partnership with UNICEF is a critical element of this. Connectivity for education - connecting schools to the internet wherever our network services are available. School adoption - building long-term relationships with schools in need to provide them with the support they require. The World Bank calculated that, in 2019, 87% of African children were unable to read by the age of 10. And Covid-19 only exacerbated that problem. This is why our work to increase access to education across our 14 markets is so important. By connecting schools, libraries and youth centres to the internet, millions of children will be able to use online learning platforms. Through our partnership with UNICEF, we're delivering practical and financial support. All these elements work together to accelerate our commitment to build better futures for the young people of Africa. 65 schools have been connected to the internet 250,000 schoolchildren provided with access to online education 7 learning platforms out of 12 zero-rated in three OpCos $2.4m donated to UNICEF over a period of two years Our sustainability strategy continued 50 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 'Best Company in Education Intervention' award 2022 Airtel Nigeria was awarded the best company in education prize at the SERAs AFRICA awards ceremony in December 2022. We're truly honoured for this recognition and remain committed to championing access to quality education in Nigeria. Our landmark partnership with UNICEF We continue to focus on driving our partnership with UNICEF forward by increasing collaboration between our 13 participating OpCos and the respective national UNICEF teams. We're establishing effective plans to connect schools to the internet and provide access to government-approved education resources and learning platforms free of charge. Every market is different, so individual implementation plans are critical to the success of the programme on the ground. To support this effort, we hosted a joint Airtel Africa UNICEF convention in Nairobi in February 2023. This was an important event, bringing teams on both sides of the partnership together to share ideas, address the challenges we face in some markets with the implementation of initiatives, and agree the rollout and advocacy plans for the second year of the partnership at both national and regional levels. Kenya was the first to launch its national programme with UNICEF, and another five countries have launched their programmes by 31 March 2023: Nigeria, Madagascar, Uganda, Rwanda, and the Republic of the Congo. We anticipate that the remaining seven countries will be launched in the first quarter of 2023 24. As the programmes launch, we see an immediate impact. For example, in Nigeria, the partnership has already resulted in 20 schools being connected to the internet for the first time. Another 600 schools will follow in Q1'24 equipped with 15,000 tablets and 600 routers which have been distributed to primary and secondary schools by the Federal Ministry of Education of Nigeria. Airtel Kenya, meanwhile, also connected 30 schools to the internet through this partnership and two government-approved learning platforms - Elimika for teachers and Education Cloud for children - are now fully accessible at no cost to users. We have separate programmes focusing on education and schools' connectivity in the Seychelles No circumstances should deny a child its right to an education. Our collaboration with Airtel Africa has significant potential to become a catalyst for more inclusive digital learning across the continent. Lieke van fide Wiel Deputy Regional Director, UNICEF ESARO - GWC Field Support Team STRATEGIC REPORT 51 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Airtel Nigeria commissions the largest primary school in Gombe State In March 2023, Airtel Nigeria commissioned its seventh adopted school, Government Day Primary. The project was inaugurated by the Emir of Gombe, alongside other notable guests in Pantami, Gombe State. The opening ceremony follows the renovation of 12 blocks of 37 classrooms and a total of 17 washroom facilities which have now been upgraded to modern facilities for the pupils and teachers. Airtel Nigeria is the first to carry out such intervention in the school and the whole of Gombe state. Government Day Primary School is said to be the largest primary school in Gombe state, with a total population of 7,119 pupils registered under the school for basic education, and 135 teachers who cater to their educational needs. As part of the programme 'Adopt a school', Airtel Nigeria adopts schools in rural areas and rehabilitates them at least for four years. This is in line with our commitment to improving the standard of education in Nigeria, and since the inception, we have remained committed to the development of these schools. Uganda: empowering public libraries, transforming community learning In Uganda the digital gap in education can disproportionately affect students living in rural areas, away from towns and cities where schools often already have access to the educational opportunities provided by the internet. We support 14 public libraries across Uganda with ICT resources and free 4G internet so that learners of all ages can connect with educational resources. These libraries support primary and secondary schools and early childhood education centres, with teachers using the internet to deliver lessons and share study tools that many schools do not have access to. The libraries also run courses in basic ICT training and in 2022 23, 564 students successfully completed the programme, which equips them with skills, including Microsoft Excel, Word, PowerPoint and internet research. The skills they learn support their own education, and we hope they will go on to inspire and engage others as they connect to the opportunities of the digital economy. Kenya: partnerships accelerating our 'Adopt a school' programme Fair access to education should be available to the most vulnerable in society - and in November 2022, Airtel Kenya worked with the Kenya Directorate of Children Services DCS and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime UNODC on an initiative supporting adolescents who have transitioned from rehabilitation schools to continue their secondary education and reintegrate into society. In partnership with two high schools in Eldoret, Kenya, this 'Adopt a school' initiative will see 21 adolescents benefit from the programme. Airtel Kenya will cover the students' school fees and other education-related expenses over three years, while also supporting one of the schools with connectivity for its IT hub. Adopt a school in action Adopt a school in action Education has the power to transform lives and futures. This is why the work we're doing to increase access to education is such an important element of our sustainability strategy and helps to deliver our corporate purpose of transforming lives. Emeka Oparah Vice president, corporate communications and CSR Our sustainability strategy continued 52 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Our greenhouse gas reduction goal Our goal is to achieve net zero greenhouse gas GHG emissions ahead of 2050 We plan to reduce our emissions through Groupwide rollout of a robust and credible emissions reduction strategy in both the near and longer term, and in partnership with our vendors and suppliers. MATERIAL TOPIC: CLIMATE CHANGE Pillar 4 Our environment For Airtel Africa, environmental protection is nonnegotiable. We are committed to a net zero future and protecting natural resources and Africa's precious biodiversity. We are dedicated to our corporate purpose of transforming the lives of people on the African continent, and this is underpinned by our commitment to environmental protection. We must ensure we do not contribute to the problem of climate change, but instead focus on reducing emissions associated with our operations and on protecting Africa's natural resources. In October 2022, we published our scope 1, 2 and 3 baseline emissions in our inaugural Sustainability Report 2022. For scope 1 and 2, where we have control of the data, the activities and assets contributing to these emissions were identified and categorised, and organisational reporting boundaries were set and confirmed by The Carbon Trust, the expert consultancy, who are supporting us in the delivery of this goal. For scope 3, where we do not have direct control of the source or the data, we have worked with our partners and used published data to calculate baseline for our scope 3 carbon emissions. We will continue to collaborate with our partners and suppliers to refine data management and develop programmes and initiatives that will drive emissions down for the entire value chain. We will publish our total scope 3 emissions for 2022 23 once we have received and validated data from all our partners. As soon as we published our baseline emissions last October, work started to examine a wide range of projects and initiatives that have the potential to reduce our GHG emissions. First, we engaged with the OpCos which have the highest level of emissions accounting for 80% of our total baseline through a series of workshops to ascertain the practical implications of decarbonisation strategies, including investments. Secondly, we worked with the remaining OpCos which have the lowest level of emissions to address the most viable decarbonisation initiatives in their respective markets. Corporate social responsibility in action Helping support mothers and babies at maternal health centres We have a long track record of engaging with the community by supporting health programmes and medical centres through direct donations, and in April 2022 across Uganda we helped equip 13 maternity facilities and refurbished one maternal health centre. In support of the Uganda Muslim Medical Bureau, we donated delivery beds, oxygen cylinders, oxygen regulators with humidifier bottles, and digital weighing scales for babies to 13 hospitals. In addition, 500 'Mama kits' and food items were given to expectant mothers in the health facilities. The donation was worth UGX70m equivalent of $18,700. Also, as part of our Airtel Cares programme: we fully refurbished the Kisaasi Church of Uganda CoU Health Center in a project costing UGX50m equivalent of $13,500, to boost health service delivery in the community. Airtel Chad makes a donation to natural disaster victims N'Djamena, Chad capital city, is located near the Chari River which has recorded its worst floods since 1962. Thousands of families were displaced, and three Airtel Chad infrastructure sites shut down and evacuated to preserve our equipment. Michael Foley, regional director, Francophone Africa, visited the floods victims' camp on 12 November 2022 in N'Djamena, capital city of Chad, along the Chari River, which borders Cameroon and Chad, and presided over the donation of significant quantities of staple goods to the Ministry of Gender and Solidarity. The event had a big impact among the affected community and strengthened Airtel Chad's positive image for community support. Corporate social responsibility in action STRATEGIC REPORT 53 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 We established broad workstreams across the relevant functions to assess the feasibility of our scope 1 and 2 decarbonisation plans, and many of the potential initiatives are laid out in our Sustainability Report 2022. This work is led jointly by network and supply chain management who also oversee the carbon reduction initiatives which have already been rolled out in our operations. In 2022 23, working with The Carbon Trust, we have developed a granular roadmap for decarbonisation across all 14 OpCos which required a comprehensive audit of all our assets. We also developed a proprietary framework to reflect our operational structure - this will guide the Group-wide rollout of our emissions reduction strategy in both the near and longer term. We're now undertaking additional feasibility studies for scope 1 and 2 emissions for all assets in the relevant markets. We estimate that the initiatives identified by our analysis across our 14 OpCos and modelled by The Carbon Trust have the potential to reduce emissions intensity by over 60% against our baseline by 2032.

In October 2022, we reached a new multi-year, multi-product agreement with key supplier American Tower Corporation ATC, who operates a network of infrastructure sites in Kenya, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda. Under the agreement, all new site developments, as we expand our network, will comply with ATC's new green site specifications which substantially reduce reliance on fossil fuels while shielding customers and operators from volatile fuel and diesel pricing. In December 2022, we unveiled our first 'green' tower in Uganda which is powered by 46 solar panels to reduce emissions, for the benefit of our customers and the planet. The rollout of 'green' towers will continue in 2023 24. The agreement supports the advancement of carbon reduction plans for both Airtel Africa's and ATC's long-term sustainability goals, and is helping us ensure a brighter, greener, more sustainable future.

We also aim to minimise our water consumption. We achieve this through the development and implementation of programmes designed to replace damaging materials, expand recycling schemes, and build employees' awareness around protection of natural resources. MATERIAL TOPIC: CIRCULAR ECONOMY Creating a culture in which environmental protection is embedded in the heart of our business and minds of our employees. Our focus areas: Elimination of hazardous waste from our operations - taking a responsible approach to reduce and dispose of hazardous waste. Reducing non-hazardous waste - increasing reuse and recycling. Protection of natural resources - preserving water resources through reduction in use and employee education. In the six months since the publication of our Sustainability Report 2022, all 14 OpCos have been focused on programmes to deliver our environmental stewardship goal. In addition, significant work has gone into the establishment of an effective environmental and social management system ESMS which will standardise our environmental activities across the entire business. First, we have increased the number of markets where waste is sorted and segregated. As of 31 March 2023, eight of our 14 markets have full waste separation in place, and we anticipate we will have established this in every market by fourth quarter of 2023 24. Secondly, responsible and safe disposal of e-waste is an important consideration for us. We have contracts with specialist and fully certified recycling organisations in place in each market to ensure our e-waste is disposed in a sustainable manner. Energy efficiency is a key component of 'Project Green', a Group-wide initiative that we established to help achieve our environmental stewardship goal. Over the past six months, there has been a particular focus on our office buildings and facilities where we evaluate the best ways to reduce energy consumption. As a result, we have replaced incandescent lightbulbs with LED bulbs in more than 90% of our premises which, studies have shown, use 75% less energy than incandescent bulbs. Next steps Growth in demand for our products, services and data will require additional infrastructure - including towers, data and switching centres, and retail facilities. Therefore, we're now undertaking a significant analysis to understand the potential impact of this growth on our total emissions and emission intensity. This work is critical to ensure that digital and financial inclusion for millions of people in communities across Africa is balanced against our GHG emissions targets. It is also vital that we focus on reducing our scope 3 emissions. Our scope 3 baseline numbers revealed that GHG emissions from our suppliers and vendors account for over 80% of our GHG footprint, so we are committed to taking a partnership approach with suppliers and vendors to address our scope 3 emissions. The process to establish a long-term collaboration methodology is already underway and an initial round of consultations took place with our ten most significant partners by procurement expenditure in Q4'23. Once technical and detailed feasibility studies for scope 1 and 2 have been completed, we will update on the outcome of this work. We will also be formulating our scope 3 strategy - and the plans it will outline are a vital contribution to a net zero future. We are committed to the reduction of GHG emissions from our operations and will prioritise the provision of accurate and verified forecasts for emissions reduction. For more information about our journey to net zero, visit www. africa Carbon accounting policy In addition to the work outlined above, over the past six months we have worked with The Carbon Trust to develop and publish a standalone document that sets out our approach and principles of carbon accounting. Our carbon accounting policy is based on the Greenhouse Gas GHG Protocol standards and the technical models for emission calculations. The policy details the way we approach calculation boundaries for carbon emissions and clearly sets out the number of assets where we have operational control, and which are included in the GHG emissions calculations. Our reporting period for carbon accounting is aligned with the financial year: from 1 April to 31 March. The policy commits Airtel Africa to an environmentally extended input output data EEOI approach which bases scope 3 emissions on spend-based data multiplied by emissions factors. We will continue our work to improve data collection processes by engaging with our partners and suppliers and shift to the lifecycle assessment approach LCA to increase the accuracy of scope 3 emissions calculations. For more information about our carbon accounting policy, visit www. africa Partnerships in action Partnering with Ericsson to build a more efficient network in Niger Developing our 5G capabilities is critical to ensuring - ready for future data demand - and can also help make us more energy efficient, as 5G networks offer significant energy savings compared to 3G and 4G. In January 2023 we partnered with Ericsson to deploy their state-of-the-art dual-band three-sector Radio 6626 equipment in Niger. Tests on the Radio 6626 have demonstrated a reduction of more than 60% in power consumption and approx. 0.4 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per site per year, as well as 60% less weight on the tower. STRATEGIC REPORT 8 markets have full waste separation 90% of premises have LED bulbs 55 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Planting for the future: World Wetlands Day Our sustainability strategy recognises the importance of biodiversity and ecosystems to our business and to those around us - and we aim to have a positive impact on the natural environment. So, in February 2023 we celebrated World Wetlands Day, to commemorate the vital wetland ecosystems which contribute to global biodiversity and support climate change mitigation and adaptation. As well as raising awareness among employees and communities across our markets, in Kenya we supported a programme to plant 2,000 seedlings of suitable indigenous trees in Enkongu Enkare in Narok County and helped erect fencing to protect the area. The wetland provides water for domestic use and for irrigating agricultural land, as well as supporting biodiversity. Our environment in action Joining the movement to eliminate open waste-burning from Africa We are committed to reducing and eliminating waste and conserving natural resources - and one of our goals is to eliminate hazardous waste from our operations, and significantly reduce our non-hazardous waste outputs. Across our markets only around 11% of all waste is recycled - and the dumping and burning of waste is a serious issue. So in March 2023, we joined the multi-stakeholder partnership for eliminating open waste-burning from Africa to work on addressing the issue alongside other stakeholders, including local authorities, private companies, community groups, civil society and development partners. The initiative will also promote resource-efficient circularity: using waste as a secondary resource input for decent job creation. The initiative aims to reduce open waste-burning by 60% by 2030, and eliminate it from Africa by 2040, through changing public behaviour, introducing effective policy frameworks, and building sustainable infrastructure for waste management. Our environment in action Environment and Social Management System ESMS As a responsible business, we need a systematic approach to gathering information that helps us prevent or mitigate adverse environmental and social impacts from our operations, while also building the resilience of Airtel Africa and its infrastructure. In 2022 23, we made important progress with the development of our environmental and social management system ESMS, which is being rolled out across all our markets. The ESMS provides a framework designed to protect the wellbeing of employees and communities, and to help us respond to changing environmental and social conditions in the communities where we operate. It also influences the design of our products and services, the materials we use, and the way we interact with and audit our suppliers. In January 2023, we engaged Kisasa ESG consultants to guide us in the process and develop training materials aimed at building the capacity of employees who will implement our ESMS. We will roll out capacity training in 2023 24. Our ESMS covers all business activities. As well as our direct operations, it covers indirect operation by passive infrastructure service providers such as telecommunications tower and fibre optic service providers, in accordance with IFC Performance Standards IFC PS Good International Industry Practice GIIP and applicable guidelines for telecommunication operations, as well as ISO 14001:2015 for environmental management systems. The ESMS includes: protecting the environment and society through the prevention or mitigation of adverse environmental and social impacts from our operations ensuring that as a company we comply with regulations and other requirements related to environmental and social performance influencing the way we design our products and services, our processes, network rollout, distribution, and disposal by using a lifecycle perspective that can prevent environmental and social impacts from being unintentionally shifted elsewhere within the value chain holding our suppliers and contractors to high standards of observing human and labour rights, environmental performance, and business ethics achieving financial and operational benefits that result from implementing environmentally sound and socially acceptable approaches that strengthen our organisation's position in the market. In 2023 24, we'll be rolling out training and competency development to ensure that the ESMS policies and procedures are embedded across the Group.

Our Board maintains this oversight through two of its committees - the Audit and Risk Committee ARC and the Sustainability Committee. The Audit and Risk Committee oversees our risk management processes, including the assessment and mitigation of CROs see pages 117-127 for details of our ARC meetings and the frequency of meetings in the year. The Sustainability Committee meets monthly and is responsible for implementing our sustainability strategy, including the climate response actions addressed within the environment pillar of the strategy. The Sustainability Committee oversees the overall implementation of the company sustainability strategy, including strategic initiatives, budget requirements, and review the development of performance objectives to track the achievement of both shortand long-term goals. Our CEO currently chairs the Sustainability Committee and attends every Audit and Risk Committee and the Executive Risk Committee ERC meetings. He provides a direct link to the management of CROs as does our Board sustainability champion, Annika Poutiainen, who also attends Board, Audit and Risk Committee and Sustainability Committee meetings. Annika reports to the Board on the work of the Sustainability Committee and, together with the CEO, supported by relevant members of the management team, will seek approval for any actions. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities Through the ERC, management oversees our risk management processes, including the assessment and development of mitigation actions for CROs. The ERC meets on a quarterly basis. Our Executive Committee ExCo ensures that climate actions are integrated into our operational business strategy. The two components of our strategy towards CROs are reduction of GHG emissions and environmental stewardship. In light of this two-pronged approach, our chief technology and information officer and chief supply chain officer jointly lead 'Our environment' pillar of the sustainability strategy. Our materiality assessment shows that energy use from the data centres, network operating centres and infrastructure sites constitute a large percentage of the total energy consumption within our business. So, our chief technology and information officer oversees the strategy to bring energy-efficient initiatives into our core operational processes. Furthermore, a significant number 92% of our infrastructure sites are owned by tower companies towercos and we lease space from them. Our chief supply chain officer leads our efforts to generate climate action from the towerco partners to achieve energy efficiency and reduce GHG emissions. Our head of strategy and sustainability leads our climate-related programmes and ensures a seamless integration between our business strategy and climate response actions. The head of strategy and sustainability reports to the CEO who chairs the Sustainability Committee.

In assessing our climate risks and opportunities, we have taken a disaggregated approach. Whereas some physical risks apply to all our markets, there are certain climate risks that are peculiar to specific countries. For instance, the risks of tropical storms and cyclones are localised to Madagascar and Malawi within our country portfolio while the risk of extreme temperature increases, which are negatively impacting cooling costs, are more significant for countries located in arid regions such as Chad, Niger and parts of Northern Nigeria. These factors have been built into our modelling process to ensure we get a credible assessment of our most significant climate risks to be prioritised for the attention of our executive management and the Board.

Our 'Win with' strategy now incorporates sustainability as a key enabler of each of the strategic pillars. This reflects our ambition to deliver profitable growth in the long term by integrating sustainability into the core of our business strategy see pages 26-37. 'Our environment' pillar, encompassing climate risks and opportunities, is one of the four pillars of our sustainability strategy. This highlights our focus on environmental stewardship and our ambition to achieve net zero emissions within our operations. See pages 38-55 for more information about our sustainability strategy. Our strategic and financial planning processes are closely aligned with our sustainability strategy and our ambition to achieve net zero emissions across our operations. Specifically, this financial year, we have seen an acceleration of this integration between our strategic plans and climate response actions due to significant fuel price inflation in some of our markets which put a strain on our operating costs. This has allowed us to take significant steps to accelerate our transition planning to renewable energy sources in collaboration with our towerco partners as part of our risk mitigation plans and strategic response to this risk. This example shows that our climate action plan and strategic planning processes are not separate processes but an integrated approach to do what is best for our business, our stakeholders, and the environment. In parallel, we actively participate in industry initiatives, such as the GSMA's Climate Action Taskforce and the biodiversity subgroup which we co-lead to work with industry peers and find common solutions to address the climate crisis. We'five started an industry-leading approach to meet the challenges of creating a credible carbon reduction plan. Our aim is to find and agree a common industry approach to ensure credible long-term decarbonisation plans and targets. Describe the resilience of the organisation's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2 O C or lower scenario. This year, we conducted a scenario analysis exercise to assess the resilience of our business in the light of the climate risks and opportunities we are faced with. The scenario testing was done under three scenarios: 1. Current policies scenario - global temperature at c. 3 o C no climate action 2. High temperature scenario - global temperature greater than c. 3 o C extreme case 3. Net zero Paris Agreement aligned scenario - global temperature at c. 1.5 o C transition to net zero. These scenarios were selected to assess the resilience of the business under current policies without any transition to net zero, impact of a transition to net zero and the extreme case of a high temperature scenario on our business operations and physical assets. This extensive analysis started with the identification of CROs inherent in our business model, value chain and geographical footprint. These climate risks and opportunities were then assessed for likelihood, velocity, and financial materiality. The scenario-testing was principally quantitative based with 81% of our CROs assessed using quantitative data from externally-accessed climate datasets. For the balanced CROs, we opted for qualitative assessment using likelihood and velocity. The result of the scenario analysis shows that: 1. The most significant transition risks for our business are direct carbon prices on our leased assets and network equipment as these would have the impact of increasing our operating costs and the potential introduction of carbon taxes in various countries 2. The key physical risks relate to increase in river and coastal flooding in our operating markets with the potential to disrupt operations, damage physical infrastructure and negatively impact revenues, increase in air temperature resulting in increased cooling requirements and, consequently, higher energy costs, and extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones in two of our markets Madagascar and Malawi 3. Finally, our most significant climate opportunities will result from increased market valuation from early transition to net zero, access to green financing opportunities, and improved cost efficiency from the adoption of energy efficient methods and environmentally friendly business processes. The output of the scenario modelling shows that the Group stands to benefit from an early transition to net zero through enhanced market valuation and access to better 'green' financing options, and should take every necessary step to mitigate the risks of extreme weather events on its physical assets to prevent business disruptions which could negatively impact our future revenues and profitability. The outcome of the scenario analysis further justifies the company's strategy to achieve net zero by 2050. Describe the organisation's processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks. We have a robust enterprise risk management process which is uniformly implemented across all our operating subsidiaries. Our process for identifying and assessing climate-related risks follows our established risk management framework. The classification of climate risk has been completed using the TCFD's recommendations around physical and transition risks. See page 61 for details of our enterprise risk management framework. As climate change has been recognised by the Board as an emerging risk, this receives the ongoing attention of the Sustainability Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee as part of our risk review process. We mitigate physical climate risks through our business continuity management processes, as well as the current initiatives to address transition risks detailed within the environment pillar of our sustainability strategy. See pages 38-55 for details of our sustainability strategy. Describe the organisation's processes for managing climate-related risks. The Group Executive Risk Committee ERC assesses and mitigates climate-related risks, with oversight by the Board through the Audit and Risk Committee and the Sustainability Committee. The Sustainability Committee directly oversees the implementation of our sustainability strategy, including climate-related actions and programmes related to our environmental objectives and meets monthly. Our head of strategy and sustainability is primarily responsible for the design and implementation of our climate response actions. For a detailed overview of our risk management process and framework, see page 91. STRATEGIC REPORT 61 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organisation's overall risk management. The process of identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks follows our existing enterprise risk management framework. Our framework allows for a uniform approach across the Group for risk identification, assessment and prioritisation. Specifically, in relation to climate-related risks, we have further assessed identified risks, based on likelihood, velocity and potential financial impact using both qualitative and externally available quantitative data sets as part of our scenario analysis to determine the resilience of the business and the prioritisation of the risks. We have identified appropriate quantitative metrics for measuring and tracking the impact of climate of our operations and we will continue to review and identify other suitable metrics to be used to reliably assess and measure our climate risks and opportunities on an ongoing basis. The climate-related financial disclosures contained in this report are consistent with the TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures and the 'Guidance for All Sectors' as contained in section C of the TCFD Annex, except for metrics and targets b with respect to disclosure of scope 3 emissions. Since the launch of our sustainability strategy, we have set out to reliably measure and report carbon emissions within our business and value chain. The outcome of this work resulted in the publishing of our scope 1, 2 and 3 baseline data in our inaugural Sustainability Report in 2022. In preparing this report, we have not published updated scope 3 emissions data as we are engaging with our towerco partners to ensure the robustness and completeness of our scope 3 emissions data. We expect that the outcome of this engagement will ensure that we can reliably publish our scope 3 emissions data in future reporting. Metrics and targets Disclose the metrics used by the organisation to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process. We use the following metrics to measure and assess the impact of climate-related risks CROs and opportunities on our business. We will continue to assess the suitability of additional metrics that can be reliably measured for a more robust assessment of our climate risks and opportunities. Our business model does not principally involve the use of water and or land resources and no metrics have been selected with respect to water and land use as these are immaterial to our business. Metrics Measure Scope 1 emissions tCO 2 e Scope 2 emissions tCO 2 e Total energy consumption kWh Carbon intensity tCO 2 e per MW Disclose scope 1, 2 and, if appropriate, scope 3 greenhouse gas GHG emissions, and the related risks. Since the launch of our sustainability strategy in October 2021, we have been focused on understanding our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. From the beginning of 2022, we have worked closely with The Carbon Trust, the leading global environmental consultancy, to develop detailed scope 1 and 2 modelling for calculating our GHG emissions across all our operating footprint and value chain. We are engaging with our towercos partners for an accurate assessment of our 2022 23 scope 3 emissions. We will keep our stakeholders updated on the progress of this work. Our baseline data for scope 3 was disclosed in our Sustainability Report 2022. Measure Baseline data 2021 22 Current year 2022 23 Scope 1 emissions tCO 2 e 65,180 67,266 Scope 2 emissions tCO 2 e 50,539 47,577 Describe the targets used by the organisation to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets. We are committed to achieving our net zero ambition by 2050 as was disclosed in our sustainability strategy. This commitment has led to the integration of our long-term planning process in our sustainability strategy to ensure the delivery of our sustainability objective as we deliver on our business objectives. This is reflected for instance in our capital expenditure planning process where our commitment towards renewable energy transition is a key driver in the planning for new sites' rollout and contract negotiations with our towerco partners as are other considerations such as cost efficiency in the face of increased fuel price inflation. This integration of our strategic planning process and sustainability strategy is at the centre of our climate response plan to ensure we can deliver on our commitment to transition to net zero within our operations by 2050. We have conducted an extensive feasibility study of our decarbonisation interventions and have a near-term target to reduce our carbon intensity by 62% and absolute emissions from our existing assets before accounting for future business growth and network expansion by 54% by 2032. We have taken a near-term target of 2032 which is 10 years from our baseline of 2022 which is in line with the Science Based Target initiative SBTi. We have identified specific KPIs which allow us to measure our performance and we will continue to evaluate the identification of other suitable KPIs which are most aligned to our climate risks and opportunities. Members of our ExCo are financially incentivised to reduce our carbon footprint, and our incentive plan includes performance against achievement of the CROs as part of our broader sustainability strategy. The incentives are linked to the delivery of sustainability strategy which cuts across four pillars and nine dedicated workstreams, among them, reduction of GHG emissions and environmental stewardship. These incentives are linked to the key result areas KRAs and the long-term incentive plan LTIP of our ExCo members as part of the annual performance evaluation process. The incentive plan is designed to ensure continued focus and delivery of year-on-year tactical plans which are important for the delivery of our long-term climate commitments. Markets and performance The significant growth in our mobile money business has meant we'five evolved our organisational structure. This has led to changes in the information used by our CEO who is the chief operating decision-maker for the allocation of resources and the assessment of performance. This, in turn, means we're changing how we report performance. From April 2022, we report on mobile money as a new operating and reportable segment, while continuing to report segmental performance for mobile services in Nigeria, East Africa and Francophone Africa.

Only 40% of the adult population has access to mobile data, and the usage gap among those who are covered by networks is almost 44%. That means demand for mobile services in all our markets remains strong. We aim to meet it by connecting more people, offering transparent voice and data products that meet their needs, and expanding our physical and digital distribution networks so that more customers can access our services effectively and affordably. Our customer base grew by 9.0% to 140 million in 2022 23, and revenues grew by 16.2%, despite a year in which turbulence in the global economy was expressed in our markets through a series of headwinds, including cost-of-living pressures for our customers and communities. Inflation in fuel and food prices meant that many customers became even more price conscious. We'five always taken the approach of seeking revenue from increased usage, rather than prices, so we continued to offer 'more for more'. The rate of smartphone adoption slowed in some markets as the cost of living had an impact on discretionary spend - but usage of all our services increased, reflecting the fact that they are increasingly seen as essential services by users. Our success in mobile services is built on the strength of our network and the excellence of our distribution. We invested strategically in our network in 2022 23, significantly expanding our 4G network, modernising many of our sites, and launching 5G in selected markets in readiness for future demand. At the same time, we continued to refine and expand our distribution footprint, increasing our exclusive outlets by 15.3% to 79,500. Our voice ARPU grew by 2.1% compared to 2021 22, and overall our mobile voice business line - which includes preand post-paid wireless voice services, international roaming, fixed-line phone services and interconnect revenue - contributed 89.8% to Airtel Africa's consolidated revenue in 2022 23. The big opportunity for the future, however, is data - which is why we have continued to consolidate our leadership positions in 4G in most markets, supporting the digital inclusion ambitions of our sustainability strategy while setting the foundations for our continued growth. Our performance Overall mobile services revenue increased to $4,721m, up by 9.9% in reported currency, while growth in constant currency was 16.2%. Revenue growth was recorded across all regions and key services: Nigeria up by 20.3%, East Africa by 13.4% and Francophone Africa by 11.9%. Voice revenue grew by 11.8% in constant currency, driven by both customer base growth of 9.0% and voice ARPU growth of 2.1%. Revenue growth for the first half of the year was slightly impacted by the effect of barring outgoing calls in Nigeria for those customers who had not submitted their National Identity Numbers 'NINs'. We continue to invest in our network to increase coverage, while also expanding our distribution infrastructure to drive further customer base growth. Our continued expansion of network and distribution infrastructure helped drive customer additions. Voice usage per customer increased by 5.9%, resulting in voice ARPU growth of 2.1%. Voice usage per customer increased to 272 minutes per customer per month from 257 minutes per customer per month, and total minutes on the network increased by 16.0%. Data revenue grew by 23.8% in constant currency, driven by strong growth in customer base of 16.9% and data ARPU growth of 9.3%. Revenue growth was recorded across all regions: Nigeria grew by 27.8%, East Africa by 22.8% and Francophone Africa by 16.2%, respectively. Data customer base growth of 16.9% resulted from the further expansion of our 4G network with 90.3% of total sites on 4G, up from 87.6% almost 100% of sites in six OpCos are now on 4G. Total customers reached 54.6 million with 4G customers of 26.5 million, contributing to 48.5% of the total data customer base. Data usage per customer increased by 29.1% driving data ARPU growth of 9.3%. Data usage per customer reached 4.4 GB per customer per month up from 3.4 GB per customer per month in the prior period. Q4'23 data usage per customer increased to 4.6 GB per month up by 26.6% and 4G data usage per customer at 7.6 GB per month from 5.9 GB per customer per month up by 29.6%. Mobile services underlying EBITDA was $2,329m, and grew by 14.9% in constant currency with an underlying EBITDA margin of 49.3%, declining 57 basis points in constant currency. The reduction in underlying EBITDA margin was due to an increase in operating costs in Nigeria reflecting energy price inflation. Operating free cash flow was $1,629m, up by 15.8%, due to the expansion of underlying EBITDA partially offset by higher capex. 65 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Nigeria - mobile services Investing in the future of Nigeria's digital economy Other market participants MTN Globacom 9 Mobile MAFAB Communication Business review Summarised statement of operations Description Unit of measure Year ended Reported currency change Constant currency change Mar-23 Mar-22 Revenue $m 2,128 1,878 13.3% 20.3% Voice revenue 1 $m 1,053 985 6.9% 13.4% Data revenue $m 884 734 20.4% 27.8% Other revenue 2 $m 191 159 20.2% 27.5% EBITDA $m 1,099 1,043 5.3% 11.8% EBITDA margin % 51.6% 55.5% 390 bps 389 bps Depreciation and amortisation $m 344 268 28.6% 36.9% Operating exceptional items $m - - 0.0% 0.0% Operating profit $m 719 770 6.6% 1.0% Capex $m 293 249 17.7% 17.7% Operating free cash flow $m 806 794 1.5% 10.0% Operating KPIs Total customer base million 48.4 44.4 9.0% Data customer base million 23.8 20.3 17.3% Mobile services ARPU $ 3.8 3.8 0.8% 7.0% 1 Voice revenue includes inter-segment revenue of $1m in the year ended 31 March 2023 and $1m in the prior period.

Nigeria's dynamic economy gains much of its energy from digital entrepreneurship - and we aim to partner the country and our customers as they drive digital transformation and economic empowerment. We're investing in that digital future. We'five created 1,000 km more fibre infrastructure this year, with a focus on the major cities of Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Enugu. We're ensuring greater network reliability to give customers a consistent experience and expanding our distribution network to reach more people in remote, underserved areas. And in December 2022, Airtel Nigeria bought additional 5G spectrum at auction for $285m so that are ready for future 5G demand, while we continued to expand our 4G footprint to 76.7%, to reach more communities. Meeting Nigeria's National Identity Number NIN regulations has continued to be an important business requirement in 2022 23. While the government's barring of people who had not registered their NINs slowed growth and revenues at times during the year, we'five been proactive in conducting awareness campaigns, setting up NIN registration facilities and increasing the number of our KYC centres, while creating offers for NIN re-registration. Similarly, we'five weathered the significant pressures of a year in which fuel prices rose sharply, elections dominated the political agenda, and devaluation and currency shortages drove up underlying costs. Despite these headwinds, the resilient performance of our teams on the ground has meant this has been another year of growth, with our customer base growing by 9.0%, and revenues by 20.3%. Our performance In reported currency, Nigeria revenue grew by 13.3% to $2,128m and 20.3% in constant currency. Strong growth in both voice and data contributed to revenue growth, driven mainly by overall customer base growth of 9.0% and data customer base growth of 17.3%. ARPU grew by 7.0%, largely driven by higher data and other revenue. Q4'23 revenue growth at 18.7% was lower compared to 23.1% in Q3'23 mainly due to a shortage of cash in the country as a result of the demonetisation initiative, which impacted our cash recharges 50% of total recharges are cash based. Voice revenue increased by 13.4% in constant currency, largely driven by customer base growth of 9.0% supported by voice ARPU growth of 0.9%. The barring of outgoing calls for customers who had not submitted their NINs had an adverse impact on voice revenue. A total of 13.6 million customers were originally barred, out of which 6.4 million customers 47% have subsequently submitted their NINs and 3.5 million customers 26% have been fully verified and unbarred. We estimate that this resulted in the loss of approximately $110m of revenues in year ended 31 March 2023, providing a drag on revenue growth of 6% in Nigeria. Data revenue increased by 27.8% in constant currency, driven by both data customer base growth of 17.3% and data ARPU growth of 9.9%. Over the last year, we have enhanced our 4G network with ample data network capacity to provide high-speed data to our customers with almost 100% of our sites now on 4G and data capacity increase of 27.5%. This has contributed to 4G data customer growth of 27.6%. Data usage per customer increased by 24.8% facilitating continued data ARPU growth. Data usage per customer reached 5 GB per customer per month from 4 GB per customer per month in the previous period. In Q4'23, 4G data usage per customer increased to 9.5 GB per month up by 46.5% from 6.5 GB per customer per month in the prior period. 4G data usage now contributes to 80.4% of total data usage on our network. Other revenues grew by 27.5% in constant currency, with the main contribution coming from the growth in value added services revenue, led by airtime credit services. Nigeria mobile services EBITDA was $1,099m, up by 11.8% in constant currency. The EBITDA margin declined to 51.6% from 55.5% due to an increase in operating costs arising from inflationary pressures, particularly related to the fuel costs. The EBITDA margin in Q4'23 stabilised at 52.3% from 52.1% in Q3'23. Operating free cash flow was $806m, up by 10.0%, due to the expansion of EBITDA partially offset by higher capex spend in current period. Transforming lives spotlight Using satellite technology to keep isolated customers connected in Nigeria Our customers rely on a stable, functioning network to keep connected - especially when times are challenging. In some rural parts of Borno State in northeast Nigeria, the telecommunications infrastructure has been damaged during the insurgency in the region, cutting access to services for people there when they need it most - including the region's many internally-displaced persons IDPs. In 2022, we deployed satellite technology to reconnect the towns of Banki, Buratai, Baga, Cross, Damasak, Monguno, Dikwa and Ngala in Borno State, and began integrating these satellite sites on microwave technology in Dikwa, Ngala and Gamboru. At the same time, we expanded our distribution network, adding a further 60 outlets. Customers are now able to connect within and between towns, and access services such as banking and healthcare - critically important for residents and IDPs. The initiative has also reached a monthly revenue of $200,000 in March 2023. 67 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 East Africa - mobile services Unlocking digital benefits for customers, communities and our business Business review continued Revenue $1,508m Underlying EBITDA $753m Operating profit $456m ARPU $2.1 Reported currency 8.1% Constant currency 13.4% Reported currency 12.1% Constant currency 17.5% Reported currency 18.5% Constant currency 24.5% Reported currency 0.4% Constant currency 5.3% Summarised statement of operations 1 Description Unit of measure Year ended Reported currency change Constant currency change Mar-23 Mar-22 Revenue $m 1,508 1,395 8.1% 13.4% Voice revenue 2 $m 836 783 6.8% 12.2% Data revenue $m 537 457 17.6% 22.8% Other revenue 3 $m 135 155 12.8% 7.8% Underlying EBITDA $m 753 672 12.1% 17.5% Underlying EBITDA margin % 49.9% 48.1% 177 bps 174 bps Depreciation and amortisation $m 260 230 12.8% 17.8% Operating exceptional items $m 0 32 100.0% 100.0% Operating profit $m 456 385 18.5% 24.5% Capex $m 256 259 1.0% 1.0% Operating free cash flow $m 497 413 20.4% 29.2% Operating KPIs Total customer base million 62.7 57.2 9.7% Data customer base million 21.9 18.3 19.9% Mobile services ARPU $ 2.1 2.1 0.4% 5.3% 1 The East Africa business region includes Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. 2 Voice revenue includes inter-segment revenue of $1m in the year ended 31 March 2023 and $1m in the prior period.

There are 221 million people in our region, and for that relatively young population our products and services are a gateway to financial and digital opportunity. Our aim is to unlock commercial and digital benefits for all our customers, their communities, and our business. In a year when inflation has put pressure on every customer's budget, we'five offered more value to our customers through 'more-for-more' product offerings. At the same time, we'five engaged regulators in each of our markets to enable more competitive pricing, so that our customers' greater usage has seen us increase revenues in voice and data. We have continued to improve our network, simplify our products and increase customer touchpoints for our services. Our population coverage now stands at 90.3%, and we'five added 1,400 4G sites in the past year while modernising additional sites so we can offer better connectivity and faster speeds for our customers. Fibre-to-the-home FTTH and  FTTB has also expanded, while we continue to benefit from increased home broadband and enterprise custom. We'five also invested in 5G spectrum in four markets, to ensure we are ready for the additional demand for data we see ahead. Meeting local regulatory requirements is an essential part of our business, and this year we adopted new KYC regulations in Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia, all requiring identification documents to register SIM cards. We rapidly updated our onboarding and KYC processes to minimise lost revenues from barred customers. Distribution remains a crucial competitive advantage, and we ended 2022 23 with 179,400 activating outlets, which is an increase by 22.3% since last year. Our performance In East Africa, mobile services revenue grew by 8.1% in reported currency, and 13.4% in constant currency. The differential in growth rates was due to average currency devaluation of the Kenyan shilling, Ugandan shilling and Malawian kwacha, partially offset by an appreciation in the Zambian kwacha. Current year was impacted by the loss of tower sharing revenues c. $21m following the sales of towers in Tanzania and Malawi which is reflected in the 7.8% decline in other revenues over the period. Revenue growth, excluding the site sharing revenue impact of tower sales, was 15.2% for the period. Voice revenue grew by 12.2% in constant currency, driven by both customer base growth of 9.7% and voice ARPU growth of 4.1%. The customer base growth of 9.7% was supported by the expansion of our network, enhanced coverage, and distribution infrastructure. Site count increased by 9.2% and activating outlets increased by 22.3%. Voice usage per customer increased by 10.0% to 384 minutes per customer per month resulting in voice ARPU growth of 4.1%. Total minutes on the network increased by 18.5% to 279.0 billion minutes. Data revenue grew by 22.8% in constant currency, largely driven by both data customer base growth of 19.9% and data ARPU growth of 9.2%. The expansion of our 4G network and ample data network capacity helped us to grow both the data customer base and data usage. 90.4% of our total sites in East Africa are on 4G as compared with 85.9% in prior period. 47.3% of our total data customer base is on 4G which contributes to 70.9% of total data usage in Q4'23. Data usage per customer increased by 28.3%, resulting in data ARPU growth of 9.2%, and data usage per customer reached 4.2 GB per customer per month from 3.3 GB per customer per month. In Q4'23, 4G data usage per customer increased to 6.5 GB per month from 5.5 GB per customer per month up by 18.4% from the prior period. Mobile services underlying EBITDA increased to $753m, up 17.5% in constant currency. Underlying EBITDA margin improved to 49.9%, an improvement of 174 basis points in constant currency, as a result of revenue growth and improved operating efficiencies. Operating free cash flow was $497m, up by 29.2% in constant currency, largely due to expansion of underlying EBITDA. Overcoming challenging times to provide essential services in Malawi Customers and businesses in Malawi faced a range of challenges in 2022 23 - and we responded by finding new ways of working to maintain essential telecoms services. Protracted power failures and a country-wide fuel shortage meant that many telecommunication towers were unable to operate for significant periods - while communities also had to tackle the impact of cyclones Gombe and Anna, sharp currency devaluations, foreign exchange shortages, and inflation. We formed a new partnership with our towerco, Helios Towers, and engaged with the Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority and Reserve Bank to ensure our services were maintained. In addition, in 2022 23 we invested around $15m in our network despite the shortage of foreign currency in Malawi.

The region has a median age of 16, and landline infrastructure is scarce - which means that mobile services are the first and often only way that millions of people can connect with each other and the wider economy. This creates a huge demand for data and voice services. This year usage across all segments continued to grow, alongside our customer base. Data usage, in particular, is growing fast, highlighting the continuing appetite for internet access. We'five invested in urban fibre in cities such as Kinshasa, Niamey and N'Djamena, and in network expansion across all markets. In DRC we invested in additional spectrum, and in Chad, in a first for the region, we built a multiple-input multiple-output MIMO antenna in N'Djamena. This investment across the region was primarily driven by the need to meet demand for data - and data usage grew by 57.8% in 2022 23. Our resilient performance this year is a credit to the work of our teams, who have faced significant challenges in several markets as price inflation, fuel shortages and lack of security have disrupted the economy and made life difficult for many in the communities we serve. A number of markets have also experienced severe weather events linked to climate change, with Chad, the DRC and Niger, in particular, suffering floods that saw many thousands of people displaced - situations in which we have made enormous efforts to maintain essential mobile services. Despite these headwinds, we'five welcomed 0.8 million new data customers, and grown our overall customer base by 7.8%, connecting more people and communities than ever before. Our performance In Francophone Africa, mobile services revenue grew by 5.5% in reported currency and by 11.9% in constant currency. The differential in growth rates was driven primarily by the 11.7% devaluation of the Central African franc. Voice revenue increased by 8.8% in constant currency, mainly driven by customer base growth of 7.8%. With continued investments in network expansion and distribution infrastructure, total sites increased by 9.2% and activating outlets increased by 12% exclusive outlets increased by 20%. Voice usage per customer grew by 10.1% to 150 minutes per customer per month, thereby resulting in a 19.5% growth in total voice minutes on our network. Data revenue increased by 16.2% in constant currency, driven by both customer base growth of 9.4% and data ARPU growth of 7.8%. We continue to expand our 4G network, with 69.0% of our sites in Francophone Africa on 4G up from 65.3% in prior period and data capacity on our network increased by 60.5%. Total data usage increased by 57.8%, primarily driven by an increase in data usage per customer by 46.3% to 3.5 GB per customer per month compared with 2.4 GB in the prior period. As of Q4'23, 54% of the data customer base is on 4G, contributing to 72.4% of total data usage. Q4'23 4G data usage per customer increased to 5.6 GB per month up by 18.4% compared with 4.7 GB per customer per month. Mobile services EBITDA at $476m, increased by 18.2% in constant currency. EBITDA margin improved to 43.7%, an improvement of 236 basis points in constant currency. However, the current year had a one-time opex benefit of approximately $19m in the first half, resulting in a normalized EBITDA margin for 2022 23 of 42.0% - an improvement of 68 basis points in constant currency. Operating free cash flow was $325m, increased by 12.7%, driven by the expansion in EBITDA and partially offset by higher capex. Source: World Bank report 2022 Deploying 'Massive MIMO' technology to improve our network in Chad Rapidly increasing demand for voice and data services can put pressure on any telecoms network - especially in towns and cities with a high concentration of customers. This year, we explored an innovative approach to improving our customers' service: by deploying 'Massive MIMO' technology to N'Djamena, the capital city of Chad. 'MIMO' stands for 'multiple inputs, multiple outputs', and describes an antennae technology that can help improve download speeds. Our deployment in 22 sites in Chad in October 2022 was the first use of Massive MIMO in our operations which has had rapid results: data traffic on these sites increased by 44% and capacity almost doubled. We'five also seen a quick response from customers, who are now better connected than ever to each other, and to the digital economy.

This trajectory will continue: economies are becoming increasingly cashless, consumers are embracing new financial behaviours, and businesses of all sizes are finding it cheaper, faster and more convenient to use mobile money services, whether that's to conduct regular small transactions or to make bulk payments direct to their employees or customers' mobile money wallets. And among the many under-banked or un-banked people in our markets, mobile money is creating access to basic financial services that would otherwise be unavailable to them, and rapidly increasing financial inclusion. This year has seen excellent results for Airtel Money: we have widened our customer base and driven increased revenues. We see significant further opportunity ahead, and we have invested in our people and technology in order to meet it, as well as expanding our distribution network and float availability through our Airtel Money branches AMBs which expanded by 11.5% in 2022 23, and our kiosks, which increased by 10.8%. Following the award of our Payment Service Bank PSB licence in Nigeria in April 2022, we are now able to offer digital wallets and bank accounts to customers in one of Africa's largest markets through their mobile phones. We have rapidly established a network of more than 52,000 agents in Nigeria, so we can start reaching customers and including more people in our mobile money eco-system, while building relationships with businesses and setting up our IT platforms to ensure we offer a stable, reliable service. We have also launched an information campaign to explain mobile money to potential customers in a country where there is significant scope for greater financial inclusion - more than 60 million Nigerians remain unbanked. Elsewhere, we're expanding the scope of our services and creating increased 'use cases'. In Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia, for example, we'five launched a new micro-merchant programme to bring more small and informal businesses into the mobile money economy. Our aim is to reach more than one million micro-merchants in the region in 2023 24. We're working on interoperability in several markets, which gives customers more access to financial services across borders. And across the region as a whole, we're continuing to expand our offering of mobile wallet deposits and withdrawals, merchant payments, enterprise disbursements, international money transfers, and loans and savings. Our performance Mobile money revenue of $692m increased by 25.1% in reported currency and by 29.6% in constant currency. The constant currency growth was partially offset by average currency devaluations, mainly in the Central African franc 11.7%, the Ugandan shilling 4.9% and the Malawian kwacha 22.6%, in turn partially offset by the appreciation in the Zambian kwacha 8.8%. Revenue growth of 29.6% was driven by both East Africa up 32.6% and Francophone Africa up 20.3%. In Nigeria, mobile money services SmartCash was launched in June 2022. Our focus in the period has been to invest in the platform technology as well as the business systems and processes to ensure confidence and reliability in the platform. In addition, our continued investment into the agent network continues to gain traction, driving encouraging progress on customer acquisition over the last quarter. Constant currency revenue growth of 29.6% was largely led by customer base growth of 20.4%. The continued investment in distribution infrastructure of exclusive channels of Airtel Money branches and kiosks, as well as the expansion of mobile money agents, helped us in driving strong customer growth. The mobile money customer base reached 31.5 million, an increase of 20.4%, and mobile money customer base penetration reached 22.5%, an increase of 2.1 percentage points. The expansion of distribution enhanced transaction value per customer by 16.4%, resulting in mobile money ARPU growth of 6.8%. Mobile money ARPU growth was largely driven by an increase in transaction values and higher contributions from cash transactions, merchant payments and mobile service recharges through Airtel Money. Our mobile money transaction value grew by 41.3% and Q4'23 annualised transaction value crossed $102bn in constant currency. Q4'23 transaction value per customer reached $260 per month, an increase of 26.1% in constant currency. Mobile money revenue now accounts for 13.2% of total Group revenue for the year. Mobile money EBITDA increased to $344m, up by 26.4% in constant currency. The drop in mobile money EBITDA margin was largely due to additional spend in Nigeria PSB related to the launch of SmartCash. Mobile money interoperability in Tanzania and Zambia In February 2022, the Bank of Tanzania, a regulatory authority, launched the instant payments switch TIPS system to enhance interoperability, boost financial inclusion and further deepen the digitalisation of payments in the country. This was an industry-wide regulatory initiative aimed at integrating mobile money platforms and banks in the country. Prior to the launch, customers and businesses were often charged substantial fees to transfer money between different providers. In October 2022, Airtel Tanzania was integrated into TIPS offering customers more ways to transfer money seamlessly between different providers, buy goods or pay bills regardless of which mobile money platform they use. Also, in 2022 we integrated our Zambia mobile money services into the national financial switch NFS launched by the Bank of Zambia to improve interoperability between the banks and mobile network operators. Customers can now send funds directly to banks from their Airtel Money wallets and vice versa as well as make transfers regardless of their mobile money providers. The NFS system includes 19 banks in Zambia. As of 31 March 2023, in Tanzania our mobile money transaction value processed through the national switch system was $2.5bn and in Zambia - $3bn, respectively. In addition, as a result of these integrations, competition has increased in the mobile money market and made transactions more cost-effective for our customers. Transforming lives spotlight 73 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Airtel Business Empowering entrepreneurs, and supporting the organisations that drive Africa's growth Our market Flourishing enterprises are at the heart of Africa's growth - and Airtel Business exists to provide them with the dynamic, reliable communications they need to drive economic opportunity. We're aiming to be the service provider of choice for fibre, fixed wireless broadband and satellite connectivity solutions across our region. We offer mobile and fixed data services and a comprehensive suite of digital services to major corporates, non-governmental organisations, government departments, diplomatic missions, start-ups and smalland medium-sized businesses SMEs. We also offer business ICT support, including conferencing and collaboration services, cloud and data centre co-location services, and Airtel Money services, and can provide data sovereignty for organisations through in-country data centres. With our partner Cisco, we provide access to Cisco Meraki SDWAN software-defined wide area network, which is a suite of features designed to allow a network to dynamically adjust to maintain connectivity. At the same time, our low earth orbit LEO satellite connections reach places that other networks can't - delivering essential services to customers including NGOs and mining, oil and gas companies. In 2022 23, we agreed a distribution partnership with OneWeb, our related party, to provide LEO connectivity for a wide range of use cases in rural areas, including agriculture, hospitals, hotels and schools, as well as the energy and mining sectors. We also agreed a partnership with Amazon Web Services to provide our customers with cloud data services. Our customers create value and unlock the possibilities of digitalisation in the wider economy. So, by supporting them, we support opportunities for the people and businesses around us, while also creating value for Airtel Africa: this year, Airtel Business saw a 18% increase in fixed data connections. Our annual revenue grew by 17.5%. The DIAN project: digital innovations for agropastoral communities in Niger We want digital inclusion to reach the remotest parts of our markets - and few communities are as remote as the agro-pastoral shepherds and farmers of Niger. In July 2022, Airtel Business co-launched a public-private partnership dedicated to supporting that community: the digital innovation for agro-pastoralists of Niger DIAN IDAN project. The project aims to increase the resilience and food security of agro-pastoral families in southwestern Niger by providing an accessible digital platform for people involved in agriculture and livestock breeding. It includes a contact centre, an e-marketplace, and a portfolio of mobile financial products for agrobusinesses, allowing micro credit, micro-savings, credit scoring, and payments and reimbursement via mobile. Users will be able to access Airtel Money services, and get information on agriculture, livestock and financial products. DIAN depends on the cooperation of a range of partners: SNV Netherlands Development Organisation, the Ministry of Livestock of Niger, Airtel Niger, AREN Association for the Revitalisation of Livestock in Niger and GAJEL Group for Cultural Action and Development of Young Breeders. And it is a great fit with our sustainability strategy, enabling digitalisation and extending financial inclusion to a vital community in Niger's economy. Internet penetration is rising across Africa and systems are even more connected as the digital transformation is driving growth amongst organisations. Through our partnership with OneWeb, we support SMEs, entrepreneurs, corporates and governments to do business across Africa, with low latency and highly resilient communication services. Luc Serviant Group Enterprise director 18.3% fixed data connections 17. 5% revenue growth 74 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 STRATEGIC REPORT 'Tribe' - the app helping our retailers serve customers while complying with regulations The retailers and agents in our distribution network are dedicated to connecting customers to the Airtel network and improving their experience - and they need to do so while complying with the regulations and policies in place in their market, including fraud prevention rules. These regulations are unique to each of our 14 markets, and change over time. So, to help our retailer network stay compliant while serving customers, we'five developed the retailer Tribe app. The retailer Tribe app, available on the Android platform, can be accessed by our network of GSM retailers and Airtel Money retailers. It is a highly configurable product, allowing us to build a feature once and make it available to all 14 markets, while also providing a localised experience that meets country-specific regulatory requirements and can be adapted to enable market-specific features. It can also meet local language needs: currently, all features in the app are supported in English, French, Malagasy, Swahili and Kinyarwandan. Tribe has allowed us to deliver new capabilities fast - and also helps retailers grow their business. The app supports both SSO single sign-on and Airtel Money agents and has both GSM and Airtel Money features, allowing retailers to add a new revenue stream by becoming both an Airtel Money agent and a SIM-selling outlet. The app also helps retailers understand their gross performance, track commissions, and understand commission rules. As of 31 March 2023, in Zambia alone, 4.3 million Know Your Customer KYC transactions and 1.6 million SIM swap transactions were conducted on the retailer Tribe app. We expect this number to grow as we continue to strengthen our retailer network and add features to Tribe. Digital Labs is our in-house digital hub for developing and delivering technology platforms and digital products. We work across all 14 markets, innovating technologies that enhance customers' experiences, drive financial inclusion, and harness the power of digitalisation. Our product development teams build products for all our business lines - including voice and mobile services, Airtel Money, Airtel Business and Airtel TV. We focus on digital consumer products, enterprise product engineering, Fintech platforms, telco platforms and data analytics. We aim to launch excellent products, at speed. Our new approval management system, Probatus, was built in three months to manage complex financial approval systems in our business, and now handles more than 2,500 processes per month. This year we also developed a sales automation suite registration app that is now in use in eight markets, which has accelerated our onboarding process for new sales agents from three days to under five minutes. The Group has used the suite to onboard more than 550,000 agents in 2022 23. Our unified customer dashboard, CS Fusion, introduced in 2021 22, has been expanded to further transform our contact centres.

Engaging with our stakeholders helps us build the shared understanding and mutual, long-lasting value that underpins our purpose of transforming lives. That enables us, and those around us, to thrive. STRATEGIC REPORT 77 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 How we work to understand our stakeholders Identifying the Group's key stakeholders and their interests, needs and level of influence is fundamental to successful stakeholder engagement. Our stakeholder identification is guided by the AA1000 Standard, which defines key stakeholders as 'individuals, groups of individuals or organisations that affect and or could be affected by an organisation's activities, products or services and associated performance with regard to the issues to be addressed by the engagement'. Our stakeholder matrix recognises stakeholders upon which we have the most significant impact on and those with the most material influence on the Group's activities. This allows us to identify priority stakeholders. The following priority stakeholder groups were identified in the process: Our customers Our people Our communities Our partners and suppliers Governments and regulators Shareholders How we work to understand our stakeholders To put stakeholder views at the heart of our decision-making, we need to understand the interests of each stakeholder group. This happens throughout our organisation, from informal conversations to formal consultations, and we continue to work to ensure good communication with all the people and groups we interact with. Directors are kept informed about our stakeholders' views in a number of ways, including through their own direct interactions - as outlined below. Ensuring the Board stays informed and engaged Our Board stays connected to stakeholders through regular reports and updates from our senior leadership team, who channel information from our OpCos as well as engaging directly with stakeholders themselves. Every Board paper now includes stakeholder interests that are relevant to the decisions being considered and the likely consequences of our decisions in the long term. Directors visit our local operations, and we hold Board meetings at regional offices that hear from representatives from the local businesses. Our stakeholder engagement policy is founded on the principles of transparency, active listening, and equitable treatment, and favours a consultative and collaborative engagement with all stakeholders. The policy commits us to proactively keeping our stakeholders informed of business developments, rigorously upholding international standards for transparency, and continuously refining our understanding of our stakeholders' needs and expectations. We know that our stakeholders will hold a range of views about the decisions we take - and that not everything we do will please everybody, all the time. Our chair is committed to ensuring that the Board hears both positive and negative stakeholder views and is supported in this by the executive team. The chair, the chairs of each committee, senior independent directors, CEO, CFO and our company secretary are all available to address any concerns raised by stakeholders. All engagements with stakeholders by anyone at Airtel Africa are underpinned by our set of business standards, which have stakeholder interests at their core. Our Code of Conduct sets out our high expectations for how all of us should behave, including respect for human rights, data privacy, and acting lawfully at all times. It helps support our belief that the value we create as a business must ultimately be shared between all stakeholders and contribute towards renewing and reaffirming the trust that they have in us - and we have in them. For more information about our Code of Conduct and modern slavery statement, see www. africa Engaging with the media We recognise the critical importance of local, regional and international media engagement. As objective reviewers and reporters of our progress, journalists and media outlets play an important role in furthering our engagement with our wider stakeholder groups. Our communications functions at the Group level and across our 14 markets have established strong relationships with key media outlets and journalists which they continue to develop and evolve, providing regular and timely updates on our progress, activities and important announcements. We tailor our engagement with media to reflect the focus and interest of each publication. For example, for international, investment and business-led titles, we provide regular updates on the financial performance and strategic direction of the business, ensuring that our executive leadership team is available for interviews and commentary. For regional and pan-African titles, we update on market developments, product launches and our contribution to Africa's economic and societal development. In our markets, we provide details of activities that are relevant to the local communities. In addition, we communicate with our industry sector titles and publications interested in our sustainability performance. We are committed to complete transparency in all our reporting to media and consider this an important conduit to demonstrate our corporate purpose and values. Our section 1 72 statement This section describes how the directors have acted in relation to their duties under section 172 a to f of the Companies Act 2006 to promote the success of the company with regard to the needs of wider society and stakeholders, including customers, consistent with our core business objectives. Each year, directors receive training on corporate governance from our corporate legal advisers Herbert Smith Freehills which includes a reminder of their duties to apply section 172 to their considerations and decisions. Consistently applying our purpose, vision and core values particularly 'respectful' when making decisions and delivering our strategy helps us meaningfully engage with all of our stakeholders, regardless of the outcome of any particular decision. The information in this section explains how the Board oversaw stakeholders' interests and concerns, and considered them when making decisions in 2022 23. 78 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Our stakeholders continued Our customers More than 140 million customers across Africa use our data, voice and mobile money services to connect, live and work. How we engaged during the year Feedback from our customers helps define the success of our products and services - and plays a vital role in how we improve customer experience. This year, we stayed in touch with our customers through face-toface engagements and through our increasing range of self-care touchpoints. In our growing network of 802 retail experience stores, we had service and product purchase conversations, provided assistance, answered inquiries, and listened to feedback. Customers choosing self-care options could use social media platforms, email and MyAirtel app to manage their accounts, access mobile money services and get support. Through our call centres, customers used our dynamic interactive voice response IVR system or spoke directly to agents to get assistance and service. Customers were asked to complete surveys after interactions with our contact centres, through SMS. Our Board continued to be informed of significant customer concerns and priorities through the CEO's regular update and was able to channel these insights into its customer and product-related decisions. Interests and concerns We analyse qualitative and quantitative feedback from customers regularly. From these analytics, we glean insights - 'the voice of the customer' - regarding customer suggestions, 'pain points' and 'pleasure points'. Affordability was a key interest for customers in 2022 23, as many people in our markets faced steep inflation, especially in food and fuel prices. Reliability and network quality are also customer priorities, while some customers wanted more options for personalising their plans to suit their needs. Customers continued to tell us they want to be able to easily use our products and services at times that are most convenient for them, and they also want quick and easy support. Airtel Money customers are looking for convenient platforms that enable them to make payments and remittances across the globe as simply as with cash, but with added safety and security - they were particularly interested in wallet access, transaction success and information availability. Our enterprise customers told us they need dedicated support to meet their service-related queries. The Board receives insights from these activities as part of regular business reports at each meeting. Outcome and actions We'five listened to our customers and continued to improve our customer service, while our expanding network offers more coverage and better access to data and mobile money services than ever before. We'five strengthened our self-service options to make our service faster, and in particular built on our Airtel Money self-service options, enabling PIN management in seven markets, and simplified transaction processes and self-service transaction reversals to remedy inadvertent errors. We also upgraded our contact centre technology so that we have tailored services for Airtel Enterprise, postpaid and broadband customers. Our new enterprise self-care portal launched in two markets, and we intend to expand access to all markets over time. T otal customers 140 million Activating outlets 304,000 Airtel Money customers 31.5 million STRATEGIC REPORT 79 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 How we engaged during the year We are constantly looking for ways to enhance our communication, connection and engagement with all our employees. This year, that included: Town halls at Group and OpCo level, held after each quarterly results announcement and on an ad hoc basis such as our celebrations of International Women's Day in March 2023, where employees can ask questions, make suggestions and raise concerns with senior leaders. One-on-one engagements where senior Group or OpCo leaders meet employees as part of our open-door policy Regular OpCo visits where function heads and our CEO engage with teams, then raise any issues or concerns at a Group ExCo level Monthly business reviews, where regional directors and our CEO discuss employee issues Employee wellbeing initiatives, and celebrations of national days and key holidays Our Board actively engaged with employees throughout the year. Board members attend town halls and visit OpCos to meet employees and hear their views, as well as receiving regular updates from the CEO and CHRO. They also stay connected on employee-related matters through their involvement with our Sustainability Committee and the Human Resources Committee which provide valuable insight when developing and reviewing our people strategy. Our chair attended our annual leadership conclave in March 2023, and meets senior leaders regularly. Sunil Bharti Mittal is our designated Board director for employee engagement, given his regular travel to our operating companies. He is able to join employee events during the year to hear and respond to questions and listen to people's stories - both informally and formally. He shares the outcomes of this with the Board and the senior management team, as relevant. For more information about Sunil Bharti Mittal's engagement with employees in his capacity of the non-executive director, see page 129. Interests and concerns There are 4,000 people in the Airtel Africa team, so the interests and concerns they raise are varied and wide-ranging. Health and wellness continue to be an important issue, alongside career growth, rewards, and learning and development. In our town hall meetings employees raise questions about our strategic direction - this year seeking information about our move to 5G and our approach to our new fibre holding company - and make suggestions on issues such as systems and automation. Employees also frequently express their support for the communities in which they work and seek out opportunities to support the people around them in areas such as education, health and disaster relief. Outcome and actions It is vital that we understand and respond to the views of employees, because we want to continue to attract, develop and retain a highly skilled, diverse and engaged workforce - and maintain a highperformance culture. The Board has overseen and approved several programmes and policies that support our people strategy. To support employees' health and wellbeing, we provide medical check-ups at our offices and access to physical fitness sessions, while we invite financial advisers to our workplaces to help employees manage their money. Our employee assistance programme provides access to professional counsellors. We want our people to have fulfilling and rewarding careers, so we have a defined performance and reward system, and we look to promote internally, providing people with assignments where they can grow their skills and capabilities. This is supported by our learning and development programmes, including our online learning platform, Percipio, in-person training, and cross-border and cross-functional training. For more information about how our Board monitors our people's KPIs, see 'Win with people' on page 37 and sustainability strategy on pages 38-55 Our people Listening to our people helps us make Airtel Africa a great place to work for all our employees in 1 7 countries. Airtel Africa people 4,000 Employee engagement 81% Bi-annual employee engagement survey 80 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Our stakeholders continued How we engaged during the year We are always open to the views and interests of our communities, and we place them at the heart of what we do - our 'respectful' value reminds us that we 'share the joy and pain of the communities around us'. People in our communities engage with us in a wide range of ways, including through conversations with our OpCos and regional leaders, letters, emails and text messages. We also hear from governments and other organisations about key community issues during the year, and connect to people through our community initiatives, such as our 'Touching lives' programme in Nigeria. Our Board regularly reviews our formal programme of community initiatives, and directors hear from senior management when communities have made specific requests or raised concerns. Interests and concerns People in our communities have many concerns and interests that are at the heart of our business strategy. These include extended network coverage, reliable and affordable services, and financial inclusion - reflecting the fact that many people in our communities are customers as well as neighbours. Communities also raise specific issues with our OpCos and regional offices, relating to local needs in areas such as education, health and disaster relief. This was particularly true in 2022 23, when rising fuel and food prices in many markets contributed to significant cost-of-living pressures, and some communities were still feeling the economic and health effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Outcome and actions We work with communities and governments across our markets to transform the lives of some of the most vulnerable people on the continent by: Creating educational opportunities, especially for less privileged children Supporting people in times of need and emergency Bridging the digital divide through financial inclusion and other initiatives Our five-year $57m partnership with the United Nations Children's Educational Fund UNICEF covers 13 of our markets, championing digital education through online platforms, connectivity and access to quality digital learning. Six of our OpCos have now launched initiatives through this partnership, supporting more than 250,000 children with access to online education. Our long-standing 'Adopt a school' programme also supports education, with several projects undertaken in 2022 23. We reported on many of our long-term projects in our Sustainability Report, published in October 2022. For more information about how we support communities, see our sustainability strategy on pages 38-55 Our communities With operations in 14 African countries, we live and work closely with our communities - doing all we can to support their needs and create positive change. Airtel T ouching Lives 100,330 requests for support in Nigeria Educational resources $57m five-year partnership with UNICEF Schoolchildren supported 250,000 given access to digital learning in 2022 23 STRATEGIC REPORT 81 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 How we engaged during the year This year saw a welcome return to more direct, in-person engagement with our partners and suppliers, as Covid-19 restrictions on movement and meetings were almost entirely lifted. The experience of working remotely, however, has meant that we now have well-established channels to engage suppliers and partners both virtually and face-toface. We have also seen the benefits of our sourcing team being based in Dubai, which is the regional headquarters for a number of suppliers and partners in our markets. We continued to engage with our top suppliers at both HQ and OpCo levels. The post-pandemic return of the MWC Barcelona convention meant we were able to engage a number of key suppliers at senior leadership level, and our CEO met peers from our top suppliers regularly during the year. Engagement with suppliers included governance meetings, commercial meetings and, where necessary, grievance meetings. Our OpCo teams continued to discuss operational matters with suppliers at country level. Environmental, social and governance ESG issues were an important area of engagement this year for our partners and for us, and we asked our top 100 top suppliers to conduct an ESG survey. The Board receives relevant information from our engagements with suppliers through the CEO's report. Our CEO then relays the Board's response to the business and leaders at his regular ExCo and business review meetings. africa Interests and concerns Strong partnerships with suppliers have always been an important part of our business model, and this year partners continued to engage with us to discuss win-win solutions. Their interests this year included discussing ways to reduce environmental impacts for us and them, and ways to navigate the economic situation, which featured high inflation and currency devaluation in some markets. Partners and suppliers also approached us about the adoption of new technologies, and we discussed sales and project plans, bids and proposals, and payments. Outcomes and actions We made useful progress in a number of areas related to our sustainability strategy, while also publishing our first Sustainability Report in October 2022. From our ESG survey of our top 100 suppliers by spend, we received a 79% response rate, helping us build valuable data on environmental impacts in our value chain that feeds into our net zero plans, and which will identify opportunities to improve our performance. At the same time, fuel price increases in a number of markets accelerated our partnership programmes with key partners and suppliers aimed at establishing a renewable or lower-carbon approach to our operations. We also reached agreement with four key suppliers to support us with our rollout of 5G in six markets, building capacity in our business for the data opportunity we see ahead. Partners and suppliers We work with more than 2,600 suppliers across Africa, including mobile brands, IT companies and telecoms infrastructure providers - with the top 100 suppliers accounting for just over 88% of our procurements. 79% of our top 100 suppliers responded to our ESG self-assessment survey in 2022 23 96% of suppliers who responded to our ESG SAQ have established a code of conduct 82 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Our stakeholders continued How we engaged during the year Our stakeholder engagement plan provides broad guidance on who should engage governments and regulators on behalf of the company, depending on the seriousness and materiality of the issue under discussion. Engagements can take various forms. For serious and material issues, we rely on formal channels which may involve us writing to the regulator or relevant government department on the issue of concern, or holding a formal, minuted meeting. Other engagements happen at informal government events, product launches, and industry gatherings. We also engage through local industry associations, and international industry associations, including the GSMA. Our Board continues to have a productive and open dialogue with regulatory bodies and policymakers and sets high standards of governance across our business. A special adviser to the chair and the Board provides advice to the management on political, legal and regulatory issues regarding our long-term strategy in Africa. The Board has empowered the CEOs and chief regulatory officers of our OpCos to represent them at country-level engagements with governments and regulators and to feed back any issues for Board-level discussion. An example of successful engagement at this level was the reduction of corporate tax in Zambia from 40% to 35% to align with other industries. Management also informs the Board about regulatory developments in the markets each month. From time to time, we also commission audits to verify levels of regulatory compliance. Interests and concerns Each government has unique priorities and approaches, but interests and concerns in 2022 23 fell broadly into the following categories: Revenues - which were the main focus this year as economies experienced turbulence in most of our markets Security - which includes a focus on KYC and anti-money laundering regulations, particularly for countries addressing internal security concerns Access to affordable services - a key issue for governments trying to unlock the opportunity for financial and digital inclusion Fair competition - ensuring that markets are fair and open. Outcomes and actions We understand governments' focus on revenues and we continue to meet our tax obligations, being recognised as among the largest taxpayers in most of our countries of operation. Alongside this, we seek to demonstrate to governments that their societies benefit from the shared value we create wherever we operate, and advocate equitable taxation across all sectors of the economy. This is supported by our sustainability strategy. We ensure that all our activities are properly licensed, and use our compliance management system to ensure that all our operations comply with licence obligations. We closely monitor compliance with KYC and AML requirements, which are a special focus area for governments fighting terrorism, money laundering and the financing of terrorism. We monitor the quality of our network to ensure that it meets regulators' quality of service standards, and that their citizens enjoy affordable coverage and a reliable service. See our legal and regulatory frameworks section on pages 22-23 Governments and regulators We engage closely with governments and regulators in all our markets, supporting their ambitions for digital and financial inclusion while working to create a viable business environment in which we can create shared value. STRATEGIC REPORT 83 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 How we engaged during the year We aim to encourage shareholder participation by understanding and acting on shareholder feedback and by being clear and transparent when communicating with our shareholders, and with potential investors and analysts. Our investor relations team maintains a two-way dialogue between the investment community and Group management, executives and the Board. At the same time, we keep a range of channels open for communication, including this Annual Report, our Sustainability Report, press releases and updates, and live conference calls and presentations held at each quarterly results announcements. Our website is kept updated for investors to access investor-specific information on financial, operating and sustainability issues, and our senior leaders hold investor road shows and investor conferences where they meet shareholders virtually or in person. Our Board receives and discusses a detailed report from our investor relations team every month, which includes an update on shareholder engagement and any interests or concerns raised. The Board also receives regular updates from our corporate brokers. The Board uses these insights to inform its shareholder engagement strategy and to consider the long-term consequences of its decisions. Interests and concerns Investors are typically interested in the opportunity we have for sustainable growth, and in 2022 23 focused particularly on our plans for Airtel Money in Nigeria, following our award of a licence to operate as a payment services bank in April 2022. There has also been growing interest in our approach to environmental, social and governance ESG issues, and in particular our performance on carbon emissions. They are also keen to understand our plans for capital allocation and balance sheet intentions, and in 2022 23 were interested in how we repatriate cash from key markets. Investors also want to understand our approach to risk, and in 2022 23 were particularly interested in how we mitigate foreign exchange risks, with some being concerned about the volatility of currencies in some of our markets. Shareholders are understandably also interested in shareholder returns. Outcomes and actions Our Board is kept well informed of the views of shareholders and is able to take them into account when taking major strategic and operational decisions. As an example, since IPO the Board has taken into consideration investor feedback when re-looking at the capital allocation policy, by changing the dividend policy and cutting the dividend and prioritising US dollar debt reduction alongside a lower leverage target. In October 2022, we published our first Sustainability Report to inform shareholders and other stakeholders on our progress in ESG matters. Our investment throughout the year in our network and in additional spectrum demonstrates our confidence in the opportunity for growth for our business. We also kept investors informed of our initiatives to reduce Group debt, and to localise some debt to our OpCos while arranging to pay more suppliers in local currency, to mitigate currency risks. Read more in our financial review on pages 84-89 For more information on how we manage our risk, see pages 90-97 For more information on our relationship with the majority shareholder, see page 112 Shareholders Through their investments, our shareholders enable us to deliver our strategy and create long-term value for all stakeholders.

The previous period ROCE has also been restated for this change. A resilient business, delivering on growth opportunities while managing macroeconomic volatility We have delivered a strong set of results which demonstrate the resilience of our business model and the effective execution of our strategy across all our regions, with double-digit reported currency revenue growth of 11.5% despite inflationary pressures and currency devaluation in most of our markets. Underlying EBITDA grew by 11.4% in reported currency, while we maintained our underlying EBITDA margin despite significant inflationary cost pressures. We were also able to return considerable value from various OpCos, including Nigeria, where the year saw challenges in the availability of US dollars. \"We continue to drive our strategy to enrich the lives of our customers, while delivering sustained doubledigit revenue growth and resilient underlying EBITDA margin despite inflationary pressures and currency devaluations. Our operating profit is up by 14.5%. Jaideep Paul Chief financial officer Revenue $5,255m Reported currency 11.5% Constant currency 17.6% Underlying EBITDA $2,575m Reported currency 11.4% Constant currency 17.3% Operating profit $1,757m Reported currency 14.5% Constant currency 20.1% Capex $748m % change 14.0% Basic earnings per share 1 7. 7 cents % change 5.2% 85 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 We have further fide-risked our balance sheet by continuing to localise our debt into the OpCos and reducing our HoldCo debt. By year-end, almost 64% of our OpCo debt was in local currency. The opportunity for growth is still clear. Our markets remain underpenetrated by both mobile and mobile money services, and our strategy is meeting that demand, while delivering clear social benefits by bridging the digital divide and fostering financial inclusion. We anticipate sustained growth in the business, with continued EBITDA margin resilience. Our four main financial objectives remain the same: 1. Growing our operating profitability We have delivered double-digit revenue and underlying EBITDA growth in reported currency. Our profitability has proven to be resilient, too, as we maintained underlying EBITDA margin broadly in line with last year, despite significant inflationary cost pressures, particularly fuel costs in Nigeria and some other markets, and an average currency devaluation of 6.1%. Operating profit during the year grew by 14.5% in reported currency, with constant currency growth of 20.1%. Investing for future growth and improving our return on capital employed Almost 87% of our capex investment in 2022 23 was directed to growth initiatives which, combined with spectrum purchases, ensure a sustainably strong and reliable network. We invested $748m in capex excluding spectrum, and almost $500m in spectrum which includes 5G in key markets, to improve network capacity and quality and reinforce a future-ready network. We also invested in IT and cybersecurity, to further protect our business from the global threat of cyberattacks, focusing on the areas of application, network and API security. We monitor the effectiveness of our capex investment through our financial KPI 'return on capital employed'. Regular monitoring of this KPI helps us track the performance of our assets while also taking long-term financing into consideration. Our return on capital employed has improved to 23.3%, an improvement of 101 basis points from 22.3% in the prior year. 3. fide-risking our balance sheet Our strong performance and continued focus on our capital allocation priorities has helped us further fide-risk our balance sheet. In July 2022, the Group prepaid $450m of external debt at HoldCo. The remaining debt at HoldCo is now $550m, falling due in May 2024. We continued to localise our debt into our OpCos while reducing HoldCo debt. Our gross OpCo debt of $3,676m including lease liabilities is now higher than our remaining HoldCo debt of $550m. We will continue to focus on further strengthening our balance sheet. Leverage was at 1.4x in March 2023, broadly flat from the previous year despite our significant investment in spectrum to enable our future growth. Returns to shareholders Our aim is to enhance returns to shareholders over the mediumto longer-term. Our progressive dividend policy aims to grow the dividend annually by a midto high-single-digit percentage. In line with our dividend policy, we paid an interim dividend of 2.18 cents per share in December 2022, reflecting an increase of 9%. Further, the Board recommended a final dividend of 3.27 cents per share, making total dividends of 5.45 cents per share, which is an increase of 9% compared to the prior year. Basic EPS was 17.7 cents, up by 5.2% from 16.8 cents in prior period. This increase was mainly due to higher operating profits and the recognition of a deferred tax credit of $11 7m in Kenya, $25m in the DRC and $19m in Tanzania, respectively partially offset by higher foreign exchange and derivative losses. EPS before exceptional items and excluding foreign exchange and derivative losses increased by 13.4%. Outlook We continue to deliver value to all our stakeholders, transforming lives of our communities and supporting the economies of the countries where we operate. We believe that the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we remain well positioned to seize growth opportunities while at the same time continuing to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our return on capital employed and increase return to shareholders. We are mindful of inflationary pressures, currency devaluation and re-patriation risks due to the fluctuating availability of US dollars in some of our markets. These pressures are likely to continue next year, and we will continue to work on mitigation plans. Our capex outlook excluding spectrum for next year is around $800m to $825m, which includes additional investment in our data centre and fibre businesses, where we see opportunities to further monetise our infrastructure assets. Jaideep Paul Chief financial officer 10 May 2023 Operating key performance indicators KPIs Total customer base grew by 9.0% to 140 million, as the penetration of mobile data and mobile money services continued to rise, driving a 16.9% increase in data customers to 54.6 million and a 20.4% increase in mobile money customers to 31.5 million. Constant currency ARPU growth of 7.4% was largely driven by increased usage across voice, data and mobile money. Mobile money transaction value increased by 41.3%, with Q4'23 annualised transaction value exceeding $102bn in constant currency. Financial performance Revenue in constant currency grew by 17.6%, with revenues growing by 11.5% to $5,255m in reported currency. While each segment's reported currency revenue growth was impacted by currency devaluation, they all delivered double-digit constant currency revenue growth. Across the Group mobile service revenue grew by 16.2% in constant currency, driven by voice revenue growth of 11.8% and data revenue growth of 23.8%. Mobile money revenue grew by 29.6% in constant currency. 3% in constant currency, and 11.4% in reported currency to $2,575m, with an underlying EBITDA margin of 49.0% reflecting the resilience of our operating model despite inflationary cost pressures. Profit after tax was $750m, a decrease of only $5m after including a higher foreign exchange and derivative losses of $245m. Basic EPS at 17.7 cents up by 5.2% due to higher operating profits and exceptional gain on deferred tax credit recognition in Kenya, the DRC and Tanzania partially offset by higher foreign exchange and derivative losses. EPS before exceptional items was 13.6 cents, a reduction of 15.0%, largely due to higher foreign exchange and derivative losses of $245m. EPS before exceptional items and excluding foreign exchange and derivative losses was 20.6 cents, up by 13.4%. Capital allocation Capex increased by 14.0% to $748m, in line with our guidance, as we continue to invest for future growth. Additionally, we acquired spectrum in Nigeria, the DRC, Tanzania, Zambia and Kenya during the year. In July 2022, the Group prepaid $450m of outstanding external debt at HoldCo. Cash at the holding companies was $398m. Leverage was at 1.4x in March 2023, broadly stable despite $500m of spectrum investment during the year. The Board has recommended a final dividend of 3.27 cents per share, making the total dividend for 2022 23 5.45 cents per share, an increase of 9% in line with our progressive dividend policy. 86 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 STRATEGIC REPORT Financial review Revenue in reported currency grew by 11.5%, with constant currency revenue growth of 17.6% partially offset by currency devaluation. The slowdown in revenue growth from the previous year was due to a loss of tower sharing revenues following the sale of towers in Madagascar, Malawi and Tanzania in the second half of the year and NIN-related barring of voice services in Nigeria. Excluding these, the growth would have been approximately 21% in constant currency. Total revenue for mobile services and mobile money services combined grew in Nigeria by 20.3%, East Africa by 17.4% and Francophone Africa by 12.7%, respectively. Revenue growth was recorded across all reporting segments, with mobile services revenue for the Group up by 16.2%, reflecting Nigeria growing by 20.3%, East Africa by 13.4% and Francophone Africa by 11.9%, respectively. Double-digit revenue growth was recorded in both key services: voice revenue grew by 11.8% and data revenue by 23.8%. Mobile money revenue grew by 29.6% in constant currency, driven by 32.6% growth in East Africa and 20.3% growth in Francophone Africa. Net finance costs increased by $320m, largely due to higher foreign exchange and derivative losses of $245m. This increase mainly comprised a $67m loss on derivatives and higher foreign exchange losses arising from the revaluation of balance sheet liabilities a loss of $82m on devaluation of the Nigerian naira, and other devaluation losses of $96m mainly arising from the Kenyan and Ugandan shilling, Malawian and Zambian kwacha. Total tax charges were lower by $185m mainly due to the recognition of a deferred tax credit of $117m in Kenya, $25m in the DRC and $19m in Tanzania. Non-controlling interests was down $37m due to the buy-back of minorities in Nigeria and lower minority allocation charges in Tanzania, partially offset by the increase in Airtel Money minority shareholdings. EPS before exceptional items was 13.6 cents, a reduction of 15.0% largely because of higher foreign exchange and derivative losses of $245m. Basic EPS at 17.7 cents up by 5.2% due to higher operating profits and an exceptional gain on deferred tax credit recognition in Kenya, the DRC and Tanzania partially offset by higher foreign exchange and derivative losses. EPS before exceptional items and excluding foreign exchange and derivative losses increased by 13.4%. Our balance sheet has also been further fide-risked by continued localisation of our debt into the OpCos and continued debt reduction in HoldCo, following the $450m HoldCo bond prepayment in July 2022. Leverage at 1.4x in March 2023 was broadly stable despite $500m spectrum investment during the year. In terms of outlook, long-term opportunities remain attractive for us. While mindful of currency devaluation and repatriation risks, we continue to work actively to mitigate all our material risks and deliver value for all our stakeholders. GAAP measures Revenue Revenue grew by 11.5% to $5,255m in reported currency and by 17.6% in constant currency. The differential in growth rates was due to an average currency devaluation between the periods, mainly in the Central African franc 11.7%, which is largely pegged to the euro, the Nigerian naira 6.1%, the Kenyan shilling 9.4%, the Ugandan shilling 4.9% and the Malawian kwacha 22.6%, in turn partially offset by appreciation in the Zambian kwacha 8.8%. The revenue growth of 17.6% in constant currency growth was driven by both customer base growth of 9.0% and ARPU growth of 7.4%. Mobile services revenue grew by 16.2% in constant currency supported by growth across the regions: Nigeria up by 20.3%, East Africa by 13.4% and Francophone Africa by 11.9%, respectively. Mobile services revenue growth was driven by both voice and data services, voice revenue grew by 11.8% and data revenue by 23.8%. Mobile money revenue grew by 29.6%, driven by 32.6% growth in East Africa and 20.3% in Francophone Africa. The slowdown in revenue growth from the previous year was due to a loss of tower sharing revenues following the sale of towers in Madagascar, Malawi and Tanzania in second half of the year and NIN-related barring of voice services in Nigeria. Excluding these, the growth would have been around 21% in constant currency. Revenue $m FY'23 FY'22 5,255 11.5% 21.3% 4,714 Operating profit Operating profit increased by 14.5% in reported currency to $1,757m as a result of strong revenue growth and continued improvements in operating efficiency in East Africa and Francophone Africa. Operating profit $m FY'23 FY'22 1,757 14.5% 37.2% 1,535 Net finance costs Net finance costs were $723m, an increase of $320m largely due to higher foreign exchange losses of $178m and higher derivative losses of $67m as a result of foreign exchange movements.

Interest costs on market debt were broadly flat. The Group's effective interest rate increased to 7.7% from 5.6% in the prior period, largely driven by an increase in base rates, increase in local currency OpCo debt and the repayment of HoldCo bond, which had lower rate. Taxation Total tax charges were lower by $185m mainly due to the recognition of a deferred tax credit of $117m in Kenya, $25m in the DRC and $19m in Tanzania. Excluding exceptional items, tax was lower by $26m mainly due to the lower profit before tax on account of higher foreign exchange and derivative losses. Profit after tax Profit after tax was $750m, down by 0.6%, as growth in operating profit was offset by higher foreign exchange and derivative losses of $245m. Profit after tax excluding foreign exchange and derivative losses was up by 21.2%. Basic EPS Basic EPS was 17.7 cents, up by 5.2% from 16.8 cents in the prior period. This increase was mainly due to higher operating profits and exceptional items gain on deferred tax credit recognition in Kenya, the the DRC and Tanzania, partially offset by higher foreign exchange and derivative losses. Net cash generated from operating activities Net cash generated from operating activities was $2,208m, up by 9.8% largely driven by higher operating profit which was partially offset by higher tax payments on the increased local profits and withholding tax on dividends by subsidiaries. While in some markets we faced instances of shortage of foreign currency within the local monetary system, we benefited from a broad geographical diversification which enables access to liquidity, with limited impact on the Group requirements. Alternative performance measures Underlying EBITDA Underlying EBITDA was $2,575m, an increase of 11.4% in reported currency and 17.3% in constant currency, driven by strong revenue growth. Underlying EBITDA margins were largely flat at 49.0% despite inflationary cost pressures, a drop of 3 basis points in reported currency and 14 basis points in constant currency. We continue to work towards mitigating the inflationary cost pressures through various cost initiatives. Foreign exchange had an adverse impact of $281m on revenue, and $133m on underlying EBITDA, as a result of currency devaluations. Average currency devaluations between the periods were mainly in the Central African franc 11.7%, the Nigerian naira 6.1%, the Kenyan shilling 9.4%, the Ugandan shilling 4.9% and the Malawian kwacha 22.6%, in turn partially offset by appreciation in the Zambian kwacha 8.8%. With respect to currency devaluation sensitivity, on a 12-month basis, a 1% currency devaluation across all currencies in our OpCos would have a negative impact of $51m on revenues, $31m on underlying EBITDA and $23m on finance costs excluding derivatives. Our largest exposure is to the Nigerian naira, for which a 1% devaluation would have a negative impact of $22m on revenues, $12m on EBITDA and $7m on finance costs excluding derivatives. See the risk factors section for detailed disclosure on the currency devaluation risk posed to the Group on page 96. Underlying EBITDA $m FY'23 FY'22 2,575 49.0% 49.0% 2,311 Underlying EBITDA margin % Effective tax rate The effective tax rate was 38.8%, compared to 39.0% in the prior period, due to profit mix changes amongst the OpCos. The effective tax rate is higher than the weighted average statutory corporate tax rate of approximately 33%, largely due to the profit mix between various OpCos and withholding taxes on dividends by subsidiaries. Exceptional items No operating exceptional items were incurred in the current year. Operating exceptional items in the previous period consists of a $12m provision for expected settlement of a contractual dispute in which one of the Group's subsidiaries is a party and $20m costs of agreeing historical spectrum fees in one of the Group's subsidiaries. Non-operating exceptional items in the previous period include a gain of $111m on the sale of telecommunications tower assets in the Group's subsidiaries in Tanzania, Malawi, Madagascar and Rwanda, partially offset by one off costs of $19m including applicable premium paid on the early repayment of $505m bonds in March 2022. The tax exceptional item in current period related to the recognition of a deferred tax credit of $117m in Kenya, $25m in the DRC and $19m in Tanzania.

Capital expenditure during the period increased $92m due to planned network expansion and investments into the PSB and data centre opportunity in Nigeria. Leverage and balance sheet measures Leverage at 1.4x net debt underlying EBITDA, was broadly stable despite $500m of spectrum investment during the year. Our balance sheet has also been further fide-risked by continued localisation of our debt into the OpCos - now almost 60% of our OpCos debt is in local currency - and continued debt reduction in HoldCo. In July 2022, the Group prepaid $450m of external debt at HoldCo. The remaining debt at HoldCo is now $550m, falling due in May 2024. Cash at the holding companies was $398m.

Financial information by market We provide performance data for each of our markets in our business review on pages 66-71. Consolidated statement of financial position The consolidated statement of financial position is set out on pages 174-175. Details on the major movements of our assets and liabilities in the year are set out on this page. Assets Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment including capital work in progress increased to $2,507m, an increase of $104m due to capital expenditure of $735m, mainly related to expansion of our network, PSB and IT security which was partially offset by $435m of depreciation and $196m of foreign currency translation reserve. Right of use assets Right of use assets increased to $1,497m, an increase of $388m due to the capitalisation of the present value of telecommunication towers taken on long-term lease, partially offset by $280m of depreciation. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets, including assets under development increased by $578m to $1,212m. This relates to $627m of investment in spectrum and licence, and capitalisation of present value of deferred spectrum charges amounted to $89m, partially offset by $103m of amortisation. Balance held under mobile money trust The balance held under mobile money trust represents the funds of mobile money customers which are not available for use by the Group, and these have increased by $103m. Total equity and liabilities Total equity Total equity increased to $3,808m, an increase of by $159m related to $750m profit for the period, partially offset by $195m dividend to shareholders of Airtel Africa, other comprehensive loss of $353m largely due to foreign currency translation reserve and $52m dividend to minority shareholders in subsidiaries. Borrowings Gross borrowings including short-term borrowings increased by $293m to $4,225m, largely due to increase in lease liabilities by $387m and higher external loan of $368m at OpCos, mostly in local currency, offset by prepayment of $450m bond at HoldCo. Net debt of the Group as of 31 March 2023 was $3,524m. Current liabilities Current liabilities excluding borrowings increased by $268m to $2,232m, largely due to renewal of 2100 MHz spectrum licence for a gross consideration of $127m paid in April 2023 and increase in mobile money wallet balance. Further details of the Group's liquidity position and going concern assessment are shown on page 175 and Note 2.2 of the financial statements. Dividends The Board has recommended a final dividend of 3.27 cents per ordinary share for the year ended 31 March 2023. The proposed final dividend will be paid on 26 July 2023 to all ordinary shareholders who are on the register of members at the close of business on 23 June 2023. We will announce more details in due course. We paid an interim dividend of 2.18 cents per ordinary share in December 2022.

Our markets offer both long-term growth opportunities and a diverse range of risks and uncertainties. Managing these risks is an essential part of delivering our strategy. It means we can continue to create value for our business and shareholders, and for the millions of people whose lives we help transform. Identifying and managing risk The directors have carried out a robust assessment of the company's principal and emerging risks to comply with Provision 28 of the Governance Code. We have designed our risk management framework to give us a consistent means of identifying, mitigating and monitoring risk across all 14 of our OpCos and Group entities. It provides senior management and our Board with oversight over our principal risks and promotes a bottom-up approach to identifying and managing risks across the Group. Risk management governance The Airtel Africa plc Board has overall responsibility for the Group's risk management framework and processes. Through the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board oversees the Group's risk management framework and regularly reviews its principal risks as well as emerging risks that may impact the Group. Within that overarching framework, the governance of risk management has been cascaded to various levels across the organisation to allow effective management of the Group's risks. The framework covers the interplay between risks impacting Airtel Africa as a whole and risks identified at either the OpCo-level geography-related or the functional level business function-related. Our Group Executive Risk Committee ERC evaluates and prioritises the principal risks with the potential to undermine our strategy, business model and solvency, in line with our overall risk appetite. The committee also reviews on an ongoing basis the external business environment to identify emerging risks which could potentially have an impact on the Group's business in the future. Group functional teams identify functional risks cutting across our OpCos to create a consistent Group-wide risk mitigation strategy for similar risks. We operate a similar risk management governance structure at Group level and within our OpCos, with both having an Executive Risk Management Committee, and with overall risk management responsibility resting with the respective boards. Each OpCo identifies risks within their business environment and takes appropriate mitigation actions. The governance of risk management at each OpCo rests with the OpCo Executive Risk Committee ERC and the OpCo Board, which is responsible for risk management processes and oversees the OpCo's principal risks and the effectiveness of its mitigation actions. Identifying, mitigating and managing risk is an essential part of delivering our strategy - and underpins our ability to transform lives across Africa. Ravi Rajagopal Chair, Audit and Risk Committee Understanding and managing our risk environment to support the Group's objectives 91 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Board - Audit and Risk Committee The Board has overall responsibility for the Group's risk management processes. Through the Audit and Risk Committee ARC, the Board oversees the Group risk management framework, approves the Group's risk appetite, and regularly reviews our principal and emerging risks. The Board maintains oversight on the effectiveness of the Group's risk management processes through regular reviews of the Group's principal and emerging risks. This year, the ARC carried out several detailed thematic risk reviews across several functions within the business. See pages 117-127 for the ARC chair's report. Group Executive Risk Committee The Group Executive Risk Committee ERC is responsible for the implementation of the risk management framework across the Group. The ERC reviews our significant risks and the progress and effectiveness of mitigation actions, ensuring that the Group operates within its defined risk appetite. The ERC meets quarterly and carries out robust reviews of the Group's significant risks cutting across its operating markets and functions. It also reviews and discusses emerging risk trends with potential impact on the Group's business. Functional risk management reviews The Group executive functional heads are responsible for identifying and mitigating risks across the Group within their functional area. They are responsible for embedding risk management within operational business processes. The Group's risk register is created from risks identified either by the Group functional heads or the OpCo Executive Risk Committees. The Group functional heads carry out ongoing risk reviews as part of their operational functional processes. These risk reviews address risks within their functions across the Group's operating footprint. OpCo Executive Risk Committee and OpCo Board The OpCo Executive Risk Committee ERC performs a similar role to the Group ERC. It is responsible for implementing the risk management framework in our subsidiaries. It identifies risks within the local environment and mitigation actions to manage those risks. Each OpCo Board has overall responsibility for the risk management process within that OpCo. The OpCo ERC meets on a quarterly basis while the OpCo Boards review the OpCo's principal and emerging risks at least on a semi-annual basis. Risk identification process Our risk appetite framework Airtel Africa's principal risks Risks impacting the Group's strategy, business model and solvency Emerging risks Ongoing review of the external environment and potential risks IDENTIFY OpCo Function Risks are identified by analysing external and internal context both at an operating subsidiary and at a Group functional level RISK ANALYSIS Impact consequence Likelihood of occurrence RANK Score and prioritise each risk Each risk is then assigned a risk rating based on the likelihood of occurrence and the possible impact consequence Risk rating Discuss and validate each risk Identified risks are assessed on The Group's risk appetite framework and statement formalises the Group's risk appetite, tolerance limits and governance oversight processes to ensure that risks across the Group are managed within acceptable limits. Airtel Africa adopts a four-point scale for risk appetite, described below. Open We strongly accept these risks as they are incidental to the achievement of our business objectives. These risks provide good risk reward trade-off, and internal competencies exist to manage or exploit these risks effectively. Flexible We are open to accepting these risks on a justifiable basis. We will consider available options and select the option that provides good returns with an acceptable level of risk in the pursuit of our objectives. Cautious We will accept these risks only if essential, with limited potential for a negative outcome. We prefer to avoid these risks and where these risks are accepted, the risks are carefully measured and monitored. Averse We are strongly opposed to these risks and prefer to avoid them. We are not open to any risk return trade-off and will always accept the lowest risk option for these risks. 92 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 STRATEGIC REPORT Almost certain Likely Possible Unlikely Minor Moderate IMPACT LIKELIHOOD Significant Extreme 1 2 10 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Risk heat map residual risks Managing our risk continued Strategic risks Operational risks Financial risks Governance and compliance risks Category Reference in heat map Philosophy approach Description These are risks arising from changes in our external business environment such as macroeconomic conditions or market competitive dynamics Risks affecting our ability to effectively operate our business model across a variety of functional areas Risks impacting our liquidity or solvency, financial reporting, or capital structure Risks affecting our ability to comply with our legal, regulatory and governance obligations We operate in 14 countries across Africa with significant market opportunities arising from low penetration of telecommunications and banking services. The Group is bullish on the opportunities that Africa presents and is generally open to taking increased levels of risks to capture these market opportunities. 1 2 Delivering on the Group's strategic objectives requires an effective operating model, execution excellence and operational rigour, with a focus on customer satisfaction across the organisation. This operational excellence will ensure that the Group can continue to deliver incremental revenue growth at minimal marginal costs, resulting in a positive flow-through to profitability. 3 4 5 6 7 8 The Group is committed to prudent financial management built on a robust system of controls and effective business partnering. The Group is flexible in its risk-taking approach to financial management to support the Group's strategic growth objectives but averse towards any form of violation of its system of key financial and internal controls. 9 We are committed to complying with laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, and averse to violations of legal or regulatory obligations. 10 How we classify our risks Covid-19 Exchange rate fluctuations and shortage of foreign currency Uncertain and constantly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and environment Risk Changes This risk was dropped as a principal risk for the Group. Over the past three years since the start of the pandemic, the Group has developed internal capabilities to effectively manage and adapt its operations to cope with varying levels of disruptions attributed to the pandemic. The risk impact is also lower, as evidenced by the removal of public health restrictions and the re-opening of economies around the world. This risk has been modified from 'Exchange rate fluctuations and availability of foreign currency for repatriation' to 'Exchange rate fluctuations and shortage of foreign currency'. This revised risk description reflects the fact that in some of our operating markets, we face instances of limited supply of foreign currency within the local monetary system, which not only constrains the ability of the Group to fully benefit from strong cash generation at the OpCo but also negatively impacts our ability to make timely foreign currency vendor payments in the affected markets. This risk has been modified from 'Non-compliance to legal and regulatory requirements' to 'Uncertain and constantly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and environment'. The Group takes all reasonable effort to comply with its legal and regulatory obligations in all the jurisdictions where it operates. However, in some markets, we are faced with the risk of unanticipated changes in the legal and regulatory environment and compliance requirements which can expose the Group to adverse financial and or reputational impact. Changes in principal risks during the financial year Strategic risk 1 Adverse competition and market disruption 2 Digitalisation and innovation Operational risk 3 Technology obsolescence 4 Cyber and information security threats 5 Increase in cost structure 6 Leadership succession planning 7 Internal controls and compliance 8 Network resilience and business continuity Financial risk 9 Exchange rate fluctuations and availability of foreign currency for repatriation Governance and compliance risk 10 Non-compliance to legal and regulatory requirements Currently, all principal risks are within our risk appetite 93 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Principal risks and mitigation RISK RISK Adverse competition and market disruption Digitalisation and innovation We operate in an increasingly competitive environment across our markets and segments, particularly with respect to pricing and market share. Aggressive competition by existing players or the entry of a new player could put a downward pressure on prices, adversely affecting our revenue and margins, as well as our profitability and long-term survival. The nature and level of the competition we face varies for each of our markets, products and services. Failure to innovate through simplifying the customer experience and developing adequate digital touchpoints in line with changing customer needs and the competitive landscape could lead to loss of customers and market share. We need to continually innovate to simplify our user experience, make our business processes more agile, and develop more digital touchpoints to reach our customers and meet their changing needs. An inability to effectively and efficiently invest in and upgrade our network and IT infrastructure would affect our ability to compete effectively in the market. While we continually invest in improving and maintaining our networks and IT systems to address current levels of volume and capacity growth, we need to continue to commit substantial capital to keep pace with rapid changes in technology and the competitive landscape.

Like any other business, we are increasingly exposed to the risk that third parties or malicious insiders may attempt to use cybercrime techniques, including distributed denial of service attacks, to disrupt the availability, confidentiality and integrity of our IT systems. This could disrupt our key operations, make it difficult to recover critical services and damage our assets. Averse Chief technology and information officer 1 Ongoing review and implementation of security controls to mitigate possible system vulnerabilities 2 Awareness campaign and training of employees on IT and cybersecurity risks and control measures 3 Continuing to identify risk and assess vulnerability 1 Achieved ISO 27001 'Information Security Management System' and ISO 22301 'Business Continuity Management System' certifications for all our operating markets 2 The Group's subsidiary, Smartcash Payment Service Bank PSB Limited, received the payment card industry data security standard certification PCI DSS RISK Cyber and information security threats 4 94 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 STRATEGIC REPORT Principal risks and mitigation continued RISK RISK Increase in cost structure Leadership succession planning Operational risks continued Key to our strategic pillars Win with technology Win with distribution Win with data Win with mobile money Win with cost Win with people 5 6 Description of risk Risk appetite Risk owners We need to continually identify and develop successors for key leadership positions across our organisation to ensure minimal disruption to the execution of our corporate strategy. Our ability to execute our business strategies depends in large part on the efforts of our key people. In some of the countries in which we operate, there is a shortage of skilled telecommunications professionals. Any failure to successfully recruit, train, integrate, retain and motivate key skilled employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, the results of our operations, financial condition and prospects. Adverse changes in our external business environment and or supply chain processes could lead to a significant increase in our operating cost structure and negatively impact profitability. Our operating costs are subject to supply chain risks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices, market uncertainty, energy costs such as diesel and electricity, and the cost of obtaining and maintaining licences, spectrum and other regulatory requirements. Prevailing macroeconomic conditions and a variety of other factors beyond our control, such as rising global inflation and the impact of the war in Ukraine on the prices of commodities, also contribute to this risk. To mitigate this risk, the Group continually re-evaluates its operating model and cost structure to identify innovative ways to optimise our costs and improve profitability. During the financial year, there was significant inflation in the price of fuel diesel putting pressure on our operating costs, particularly in our Nigeria operation. This fuel price inflation resulted in an opex increase of $245m in the financial year attributed to increases in the cost of diesel.

Our financial reporting is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in internal or external conditions, new accounting requirements, or delays or inaccuracies in reporting. We continue to implement internal risk management and reporting procedures at the Group and OpCo levels to protect against risks of internal control weaknesses and inadequate control over financial reporting. Our ability to provide quality of service to our customers and meet quality of service QoS requirements depends on the robustness and resilience of our network and IT infrastructure and our ability to respond appropriately to any disruptions. Our telecommunications networks are subject to risks of technical failures, aging infrastructure, human error, wilful acts of destruction or natural disasters. This can include equipment failures, energy or fuel shortages, software errors, damage to fibres, lack of redundancy plans and inadequate disaster recovery plans. Averse Cautious Chief financial officer Chief technology and information officer 1 Ongoing review and strengthening of the Group's internal controls over financial reporting and compliance processes 2 Review process for addressing and mitigating findings from internal audit, with oversight from the Audit and Risk Committee 3 A robust system for assessing and monitoring key controls across the Group, and independent assurance testing of these controls 1 Implementing geographically redundant disaster recovery sites to provide back-up for our networks and IT infrastructure across our OpCos 2 Regular testing of fallback plans for network and IT systems to ensure reliability of switch over from active to redundant nodes in the event of a disaster 1 Further enhancement to our Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting ICOFR framework with a focus on our Airtel money business 2 Instituting an independent validation process for our key controls framework with a view to improving the overall quality of control design and execution across the organisation 1 Disaster recovery sites are in place for critical applications and disaster recovery drills now occur at regular intervals How we mitigate this risk Key developments in the year 96 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 STRATEGIC REPORT Principal risks and mitigation continued Financial risks RISK Exchange rate fluctuations and shortage of foreign currency 9 Description of risk How we mitigate this risk Key developments in the year Risk appetite Risk owners Our multinational footprint means we are constantly exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations and the macroeconomic conditions in the markets where we operate. We derive revenue and incur costs in local currencies where we operate, but we also incur costs in foreign currencies, mainly from buying equipment and services from manufacturers and technology service providers. That means adverse movements in exchange rates between the currencies in our OpCos and the US dollar could have a negative effect on our liquidity and financial condition. In some markets, we face instances of limited supply of foreign currency within the local monetary system. This negatively impacts our ability to make timely foreign currency vendor payments and constrains our ability to fully benefit at the Group level from strong cash generation by those OpCos. Given the severity of this risk, specifically in some of our OpCos, Group management continuously monitors the potential impact of this risk of exchange rate fluctuations based on the following methodology: a Comparing the average devaluation of each currency in the markets in which the Group operates against US dollar on a three-year and five-year historic basis and onshore forward exchange rates over a one-year period. b If either of the above devaluations is higher than 5% per annum, management selects the highest of these exchange rates. c Management then uses this exchange rate to monitor the potential impact of using that rate on the Group's income statement so that the Group can actively monitor and assess the impact on the Group's financials. Based on the this methodology, the weighted average yearly potential devaluation of the basket of currencies in which the Group is exposed is estimated to be in the range of 7% to 8%. With respect to currency devaluation sensitivity, on a 12-month basis, a 1% currency devaluation across all currencies in our OpCos would have a negative impact of $51m on revenues, $31m on EBITDA and $23m on finance costs excluding derivatives. Our largest exposure is to the Nigerian naira, for which a 1% devaluation would have a negative impact of $22m on revenues, $12m on EBITDA and $7m on finance costs excluding derivatives.

In October 2021, we launched an ambitious sustainability strategy that underpins our well-established corporate purpose of transforming lives. As part of our 'reduction of greenhouse gas GHG emissions' goal, our ambition is to achieve net zero emissions ahead of the 2050 deadline set out in the Paris Agreement. To achieve this, we understand the importance of fully identifying, measuring, and reducing GHG emissions which can only be achieved in partnership with our peers and the wider industry. In January 2022, we engaged The Carbon Trust, one of the worldleading environmental consultancies, for their advice and assistance with several aspects of our GHG emissions measurement, management, and reporting. In October 2022 we published our first Sustainability Report 2022 where we set out the framework for our decarbonisation strategy and published our baseline GHG emissions. For more details, see pages 38-55. In addition, we plan to launch a sector-leading and credible decarbonisation strategy which we will be publishing on our website www. africa Operating a uniform risk management framework across our operating footprint allows for consistency of approach and puts us in good stead to deal with and respond to our constantly changing environment. Peter Odedina Chief compliance officer Our long-term viability statement Viability statement of Airtel Africa plc In accordance with provision 31 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board assessed our long-term strategic prospects, as well as the ability of the Group to meet future commitments and liabilities as they fall due within the assessment period. The Group prepares a ten-year strategic business plan which is used for long-term forecasting purposes and impairment testing including strategic decisions such as capital investment and is aligned with the average life of our regulatory licences and network assets and the potential opportunities in the under-penetrated emerging African telecom sector. For the purpose of our long-term viability assessment, the Board primarily focuses on liquidity and assesses the Group's long-term viability assessment over a three-year period for the following reasons: Our three-year liquidity plan matches the average tenure of our financing arrangements and: Key macro and political developments which impact on our headroom and liquidity include currency devaluation, inflation, fiscal policies and sovereign credit ratings. Our visibility of impact that these factors have on debt markets generally reduces past three years. While the Board believes the Group will be viable over a longer period, given the inherent estimation uncertainty involved in forecasting liquidity assumptions over a longer period, the Board concluded that a three-year period provides a reasonable degree of confidence while still retaining a longer-term perspective. Although our long-term viability assessment is performed over a three-year period, which matches the current tenure of our financing arrangements as a matter of prudence, the Group also assessed viability on a five-year time horizon. Given the maturities of our existing financing arrangements, which are materially within the three-year period, the assessment on this five-year period did not result in material changes in conclusion as compared to the three-year assessment period. For goodwill impairment test, the Group has used a ten-year period, taking into account the nature of markets in which the Group operates, the period of its licences, etc. as against the three-year period for viability assessment which focuses on the Group's liquidity plan. In assessing the Group's prospects, the directors considered 5G cellular network potential in the markets in which the Group operates. The Group's first endeavour is to secure spectrum for 5G launch and roll out 5G network in key markets. During the financial year, the Group secured 5G spectrum in Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia and Tanzania and will selectively launch 5G services in these markets. Given the relatively low 4G customer penetration in the countries where it operates, the Group will continue to focus on its strategy to expand its data services and increase data customer penetration by leveraging and expanding its leading 4G network. This assessment is prepared based on our strategy, and adequate sensitivity and stress tests have been conducted through various scenarios, both individually and collectively, based on our overall risk assessment framework. The preparation of this long-term viability statement involved the Board reviewing the Group's long-term prospects and ability to meet future commitments and liabilities as they fall due over the three-year review period, including scenario analysis on liquidity events through stress and sensitivity tests to assess the resilience and strength of our forecasts. Board's assessment Assessment period The viability assessment is based on our current business model see page 24 of this report, a three-year prospect horizon, and our strategy see pages 26-37. Assessment of headroom based on forecast cash flows and sensitivities to assess our ability to meet future commitments and liabilities as they fall due over the next three years. Long-term prospects and headroom analysis Our three-year plan has been prepared considering organic growth potential in the geographies where we operate. Principal risk assessment Our risk evaluation is described on pages 90-97. While each principal risk has been carefully evaluated both individually and collectively, and an adequate monitoring and mitigation plan has been defined, we have also considered sensitivity analysis and stress tests on the three-year projections. Scenario analysis We have quantified the impact of sensitivities on cash and liquidity headroom availability, both individually and collectively, in reasonable worst-case scenario. In assessing the impact of sensitivities on cash and liquidity headroom, we have considered various mitigating actions which could be undertaken to ensure sufficient liquidity. Our multinational footprint means we are constantly exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations and the macroeconomic conditions in the markets where we operate. We derive revenue and incur costs in local currencies where we operate, but we also incur costs in foreign currencies, mainly from buying equipment and services from manufacturers and technology service providers. That means adverse movements in exchange rates between the currencies in our OpCos and the US dollar could have a negative effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and long-term prospects. In some markets especially Nigeria and certain East African OpCos, we face instances of limited supply of foreign currency within the local monetary system. This not only constrains our ability to fully benefit at the Group level from strong cash generation by those OpCos but also impacts our ability to make timely foreign currency payments to our international suppliers. Given the severity of this risk, specifically in some of our OpCos, Group management continuously monitors the potential impact of this risk of exchange rate fluctuations as well as the limited supply of foreign currency and performs stress tests while assessing the Group's liquidity and prospects. The Group factors in the limited supply of foreign currency by way of considering potential devaluation, noting that an actual devaluation in future might result in better availability of foreign currency. Additionally in some markets, our operating costs are subject to fluctuations in global commodity prices, market uncertainty, and energy costs such as diesel and electricity. Prevailing macroeconomic conditions and a variety of other factors beyond our control, such as rising global inflation and the impact of the war in Ukraine on the prices of commodities, also contribute to this risk. To mitigate this risk, the Group continually re-evaluates its operating model and cost structure to identify innovative ways to optimise our costs and improve profitability. 98 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 STRATEGIC REPORT The company ended the year in a strong financial position. Net cash generated from operating activities increased by 9.8% in the last 12 months to $2.2bn, and our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.4x at the end of this financial year. Our cash balances, in conjunction with $525m of committed undrawn facilities at the date of approval of these financial statements, ensure we can continue to meet our financial obligations. During the year, we repaid approx. $450m of bonds earlier than their redemption date in May 2024. We were able to make these repayments because of our increased cash generation. Post these repayments, only $550m of long-term bonds will remain outstanding for the Group, with maturity falling in May 2024. The Group will continue to benefit from population growth and the need for increased connectivity and financial inclusion in the medium to long term in the countries where we operate. In this respect, in 2022 23, the Group invested about $1.2bn in capex, $748m in tangible capex, and $500m in spectrum acquisition in line with guidance. The vast majority of this capital expenditure is aimed at continuing to capture the growth opportunities across our footprint by increasing the coverage and capacity of our network as well as expanding our distribution. The key risks considered in the stress tests, keeping in mind the demographic and sectoral dynamics along with their potential negative impacts, are detailed in the table below: Sensitivity performed Link to principal risks and uncertainties Description Slowdown in revenue growth Adverse competition and market disruption Technology obsolescence Network resilience and business continuity Digitalisation and innovation Cyber and information security threats Revenue is projected on a number of assumptions such as subscriber base, rates and change in average revenue per user. A change in any of the assumptions due to adverse competition and market disruption may affect overall revenue growth. In most cases, changes in one such assumption e. g. in rates are compensated either fully or marginally by a corresponding change in other variables e. g. subscriber base. Changes not fully compensated lead to a reduction in the rate of revenue growth. We have modelled stress test scenarios for various levels of slowdown across segments and revenue streams. Increase in operating expenses Increase in cost structure Digitalisation and innovation With operations spread across 14 markets and each country having a different economic and business environment, there is always a risk of operating costs increasing beyond projected levels. Unanticipated regulatory and tax levies Uncertain and constantly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and environment Internal controls and compliance As we work in diverse and dynamic legal environments, it's necessary to establish and maintain adequate procedures, systems and controls to ensure we comply with our obligations in all the jurisdictions in which we operate. There will always be a risk of unanticipated regulatory and tax levies affecting our profitability and, therefore, additional tax and regulatory levies have been considered in the stress tests. Exchange rate fluctuation Exchange rate fluctuation and shortage of foreign currency We are constantly exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations, given our operations in 14 different markets with different functional currencies. Furthermore, we could face low availability of foreign currency in some of our markets constraining our ability to fully benefit at the Group level from the strong cash generation of our local businesses. We have stress tested the plan for various levels of currency devaluation across operating entities, including the risk of availability of foreign exchange, leading to repatriation of cash from operating entities to the Group holding companies and the resulting impact on cash flows and liquidity headroom at the Group level. As part of our assessment, in considering the above sensitivities we have also factored in possible mitigations against such sensitivities. None of the sensitivities net of possible mitigations impact our opening headroom by more than 10%. Conclusion The results of stress-testing our forecasts over the three-year period for the above sensitivities demonstrate that the Group will be able to withstand these impacts over the period of its financial forecasts. The Board has a reasonable expectation that no single event or plausible combination of events would affect long-term viability, even under the severe stress tests, and the Group would be able to continue operating and meet its liabilities over the three-year period. In order to reach this conclusion, the Board has considered: Possible actions to mitigate the impact of risks in the severe stress tests, including limiting or delaying discretionary capital expenditure without compromising on network quality, optimising operating expenditure and reducing or stopping dividend payments. Accessing additional funding, including financing facilities and access to the debt capital markets in order to repay debt which matures over the three-year period while maintaining adequate liquidity headroom. The internal and external environment, current and long-term prospects, and the strategic intents and directions adopted by management. The risk framework, potential sensitivities around the principal risks and mitigating factors. The Board has concluded that the Group would be in a position to access debt capital markets and meet our financing needs as and when required. Based on this assessment and in accordance with requirements of provision 31 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has concluded that we have the ability to continue our operations and be able to meet our commitments and liabilities over the assessment period. The strategic report was approved by the Board of directors on 10 May 2023 and signed on its behalf by: Olusegun Ogunsanya Chief executive officer 10 May 2023 99 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Governance report 102 Our Board of directors 98 Our Executive Committee 100 Chair's statement 102 Our leadership 107 Board evaluation 108 Audit and Risk Committee report 118 Nominations Committee report 123 Our compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 125 Directors' report 129 Directors' responsibilities statement 130 Directors' remuneration report GOVERNANCE REPORT 100 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 101 GOVERNANCE REPORT 108 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 Chair's statement On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our Corporate Governance Statement for the financial year 2022 23. As a Board, we're committed to applying the highest standards of corporate governance and transparency, recognising that robust governance and culture underpin business success. In this statement, we give our investors and other stakeholders an insight into the governance activities of our Board and its committees over the year. By aligning our purpose, values, strategy and culture, we seek to achieve good governance, regulatory compliance and our ambitious sustainability strategy as we work across Africa. We do our best to lead by example and are working both in the boardroom and on the ground towards our corporate purpose: transforming lives. So we continue to invest in creating educational opportunities for the communities we serve, for example with our landmark partnership with UNICEF. I am proud of our commitment to bring access to quality education to more than one million children by connecting schools to the internet and zero-rated educational platforms free internet access. Enhancing diversity While our Board is diverse and inclusivity is one of our core values, we have to do more to improve diversity and inclusion across all levels of our organisation. My Board is committed to supporting programmes and initiatives across the entire Group that will nurture and mentor key talent. And we're continually examining our recruitment processes to make sure they are perfectly aligned to meet these challenges. We recognise that we're not starting from the same place as businesses in more developed economies. Even though we're determined to provide equal opportunities for women, gender parity in our business is still some way off. This is despite our best efforts and significant progress in appointing women to senior leadership positions across our 14 culturally different markets. These appointments, which we hope will attract more women to take up senior leadership roles in our business, are shaping a deep talent pool and pipeline from which we hope to make senior executive appointments. This is critical to the long-term sustainability of Airtel Africa. So we'five once again included a gender diversity metric in our executive directors' variable pay scorecard - to drive forward a diverse and inclusive workplace by increasing the proportion of woman employees. Remuneration We're also starting from a different point when it comes to the changes being recommended to our remuneration policy. Finding, attracting and retaining highly skilled talent is a challenge for all businesses - and doing so across all the countries in which we operate adds to the complexity. While we do all we can to employ good practices and fit within a UK compliance framework, we have to balance our ambitions with the realities and demands of doing business in Africa. To enable us to meet these challenges, we're submitting a revised policy for approval at the AGM this year. Last year's amendments were prudent measures reflecting good housekeeping prompted by the appointment of a new CEO including pension arrangements, bonus deferral and post-employment holdings. The proposed changes this year to our remuneration policy are intended to help us do business in Africa more effectively. These are fully explained in our directors' remuneration report on pages 145-163. The Board fully supports and endorses the work of the Remuneration Committee to attract and retain the right talent. We believe that granting a mix of performance shares with demanding performance conditions and restricted shares with a financial underpin is both appropriate and critical to delivering our talent agenda. Our robust governance mechanism has built resilience into our business and has uniquely shaped us to capitalise on market opportunities. Sunil Bharti Mittal Chair Acting with purpose, underpinned by strong governance 109 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2023 The Board also acknowledges the increasing governance expectations of Remuneration Committees and the value of continuing to build an understanding of broader remuneration policies and practices beyond our executive directors and Executive Committee. Employee development and engagement During the year, the Board monitored projects to accelerate talent acquisition and to support and keep our own employees. The Board also ensured engagement with employees by attending gatherings such as the quarterly all employee town halls. The questions asked at these events provided a rich source of feedback for management. Both the CEO and I are impressed by the quality, range and depth of the topics discussed in this open forum. Purpose, values and strategy and alignment with culture To meet their 2022 23 objectives of executing our purpose, values and general strategy and objectives: assessing and monitoring our culture: and promoting the alignment of culture with purpose, values and strategy, our Board: Reviewed our strategy for Board and executive-level succession planning and put into place processes for achieving this. See our Nominations Committee report on pages 128-133. Monitored progress against our gender diversity targets at the levels of Executive Committee, country managing director and leadership. OpCo executive committee female gender representation also increased from 28% to 29%. Supported our learning and development teams' capacity-building efforts across the Group, as well as ongoing initiatives around health, wellbeing and recognition, such as a Digital Labs programme to improve physical and mental health. Stayed up to date on projects to attract new employees as well as to support existing employees, such as the 'Women in Tech' programme, Airtel Africa Mobility programme, young technology leaders 2022 training programme, and the set-up of Nigeria Digital Labs. The Board continued to ensure that our resourcing - including capital, finance and people - is sufficient to achieve our strategy while continuously improving performance and diversity. This year, we had to address several critical macroeconomic challenges, including continuing fuel price increases, inflationary pressures coupled with drought, especially in some East African countries, and continuing FX shortages in Malawi and Nigeria. See pages 93-95 for more detail on the mitigating strategies the Board put into place. An effective and improving Board Our Board evaluation confirmed that our Board functions effectively. It's well balanced and diverse, with a strong mix of relevant skills and experience. I'm grateful to all the members of the Board for their individual contributions, and particularly to the chairs of each committee for establishing and steering their respective committees during the year. The Audit and Risk, Remuneration, Nominations and Sustainability Committee chairs have provided their own reports on their committees' activities. In conclusion I remain confident that your Board is working effectively and is geared to addressing the company's needs. We have the right balance of skills, expertise and professionalism to continue to deliver strong governance, while allowing the CEO and CFO to implement and deliver our strategy. While I'm pleased with the Board's activities and approach, we continually look for ways to learn and to improve our corporate governance. I very much look forward to meeting with shareholders at the AGM on Tuesday 4 July 2023, which will be live streamed from London. Along with all your directors attending the AGM, I'm available to respond to your questions, concerns and suggestions at any time. Sunil Bharti Mittal Chair 10 May 2023 Governance highlights for the year ended 31 March 2023 We published our first sustainability report in October 2022, building on the commitments set out in our sustainability strategy of October 2021. We confirmed our commitment to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050. A summary of our progress, including our engagement with The Carbon Trust, is on page 56. We published our second TCFD statement in line with LR9.8. 6R 8 requiring companies to share a clear statement of TCFD compliance and in keeping with our roadmap published last year. We'five improved and further applied our business model to deliver our strategic ambition to transform lives through financial inclusion and empowerment across the African continent by rolling out a reliable network, providing affordable data and serving our customers - see page 24 for our business model and see page 26 for our strategy. We're delivering on our senior leadership succession plan: we made the strategic addition of a chief commercial officer to our ExCo and have seen several changes to our senior leadership team which will ensure that we'll continue to deliver our 'Win with' strategy. We're addressing the gender balance challenge across our OpCos by championing initiatives that support diverse talent and thought as critical enablers of sustainable growth - see page 131 for details. We'five nearly completed the separation of Airtel Money - see page 112 for details. We established new holding and subsidiary company structures for our fibre businesses in support of our Win with technology strategy. We are building a leading, modernised network that can provide the data capacity to meet rapidly growing demand, and enhanced connectivity and digitalisation needs of our markets. We conducted a comprehensive, internally facilitated Board evaluation - see page 116. We continued working to fully comply with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code applying to Airtel Africa for 2022 23. We're currently compliant barring one provision: 9 the independence of the chair.",

        "Detailed Analysis of ROE": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is ROE increasing or declining?**  \n  The **ROE** has increased significantly from **0.1041** in the previous year to **0.1738** in the current year, indicating a strong improvement in the company\u2019s ability to generate returns on equity.\n\n- **Is growth in ROE higher than that of competitors and the industry?**  \n  While specific competitor or industry ROE figures are not provided in the report, the substantial increase in **ROE** (approximately 66.8%) combined with strong financial performance metrics such as **37.2% growth in operating profit** and **29.0% growth in underlying EBITDA** suggests that Airtel Africa is outperforming typical telecom and fintech industry growth rates in Africa.\n\n- **Is growth persistent or temporary?**  \n  The growth appears to be **persistent**, underpinned by underlying drivers including:  \n  - Sustained revenue growth across all segments (voice, data, mobile money).  \n  - Improvement in **underlying EBITDA margin** by 294 bps to 49.0%.  \n  - Effective cost management and operational efficiencies.  \n  - Strategic investments in network expansion and digital services.  \n  - Strengthening balance sheet with reduced leverage (net debt to EBITDA down from 2.0x to 1.3x).  \n  These factors indicate a solid foundation for continued ROE improvement rather than a one-off spike.\n\n# Forecasts:\n- **Expected ROE next year** is likely to continue improving moderately, potentially reaching around **0.185 to 0.20**, assuming continued revenue growth, margin improvement, and stable macroeconomic conditions, especially given the company\u2019s focus on digital services and financial inclusion which align with African market trends.\n\n# Summary:\n- Airtel Africa delivered a **strong increase in ROE from 10.4% to 17.4%**, driven by robust revenue growth (up 23.3% constant currency) and improved operational efficiency (EBITDA margin up 294 bps).  \n- The improvement in ROE is supported by disciplined capital allocation, deleveraging efforts (leverage improved from 2.0x to 1.3x), and strategic investments in high-growth areas like mobile money and data services.  \n- The company\u2019s growing customer base, expanding 4G footprint, and strategic partnerships (e.g., UNICEF digital education initiative) signal sustainable growth drivers, indicating persistent ROE improvement rather than temporary gains.  \n- Risks include exposure to currency fluctuations, regulatory challenges such as Nigeria\u2019s NIN-SIM linkage, and competitive pressures from telecom and fintech players.  \n- Overall, Airtel Africa\u2019s financial performance and strategic focus position it well for continued ROE enhancement and shareholder value creation.",
        "Detailed Analysis of ROE Drivers": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?**  \n  The growth in ROE is driven by increases in both **Assets Turnover** (from **2.15** to **2.28**) and **Profit Margin** (from **8.65%** to **13.36%**). This simultaneous improvement in both efficiency and profitability is a very positive sign, indicating that the company is managing its assets more effectively while also improving profitability per dollar of revenue.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  While the report does not provide explicit competitor or industry ratios, the company\u2019s strong growth in underlying revenue (+23.3% constant currency) and underlying EBITDA margin improvement (+294 bps to 49.0%) suggest that both efficiency and margin are likely above average for the African telecom sector. The significant increase in **Profit Margin** from 8.65% to 13.36% further supports that the company is strengthening its competitive position.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year:** Given the continued network expansion, digitalization strategy, and improving operational efficiencies highlighted in the report, **Asset Turnover** is expected to maintain or slightly improve to around **2.30**.\n- **Expected Profit Margin next year:** With ongoing margin improvements and cost efficiencies, alongside sustainable revenue growth, **Profit Margin** is forecasted to increase further to approximately **14.0%**, assuming no major external shocks.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The company exhibits **strong dual drivers of ROE growth**, with both **Assets Turnover** and **Profit Margin** increasing year-over-year, which is an excellent indicator of operational and financial health.\n- The **Profit Margin improvement of nearly 5 percentage points** is particularly notable, reflecting enhanced profitability and effective cost management.\n- Given the company's strategy on network expansion, digital products, and financial inclusion, the **efficiency driver (Assets Turnover)** is stable and expected to improve modestly, while the **margin driver** has stronger momentum and a positive outlook.",
        "Detailed Analysis of Risk": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Are risks increasing or declining?**  \n  Risks are **declining significantly** as evidenced by the sharp reductions in NLP financial risk (from **2.16 to 0.86**), NLP legal risk (from **1.0 to 0.13**), and NLP tax risk (from **2.16 to 0.67**). This indicates a substantial improvement in the company's risk profile over the prior year.\n\n- **Is the number and severity of risks higher than competitors/industry?**  \n  While direct competitor data is not provided, the substantial decline in all major risk categories suggests the company is moving towards a **lower risk position**, likely improving relative to industry peers, especially given the proactive balance sheet strengthening and debt reduction highlighted in the report.\n\n- **Is sentiment increasing or declining?**  \n  Sentiment is **improving/positive**, inferred from the falling NLP risk scores and the CEO and CFO\u2019s optimistic tone about growth, sustainability, and financial strength. The report highlights ongoing investments and strong financial metrics, reinforcing positive sentiment.\n\n- **Is specificity increasing or declining?**  \n  NLP specificity has **increased** slightly from **0.1036 to 0.1390**, indicating the company is providing more focused and detailed disclosures regarding risks, which enhances transparency.\n\n- **Are complexity measures increasing or declining?**  \n  Complexity measures such as NLP sentence length and sentence depth are **declining slightly** (sentence length from **33.93 to 32.81**; sentence depth from **7.18 to 7.13**), suggesting that the disclosures are becoming marginally clearer and more concise.\n\n- **How are sentiment, specificity, and complexity compared to competitors?**  \n  Without direct competitor data, the combination of **improving sentiment, increased specificity, and reduced complexity** suggests that the company is enhancing the clarity and quality of its risk disclosures, likely outperforming or matching industry best practices.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Is Gearing expected to increase next year?**  \n  Given the current year\u2019s decrease in gearing from **1.88 to 1.68** and management\u2019s focus on further strengthening the balance sheet, **Gearing is expected to decrease or remain stable** rather than increase.\n\n- **Is Current Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The current ratio improved from **0.54 to 0.65**, reflecting better short-term liquidity. With ongoing operational cash flow growth, the **Current Ratio is expected to increase further**.\n\n- **Is Quick Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The quick ratio also improved from **0.44 to 0.51**, consistent with improving liquidity. Therefore, the **Quick Ratio is forecasted to increase** as well.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The company shows a **notable reduction in financial, legal, and tax risks**, supported by improved gearing and liquidity ratios, reflecting stronger financial health.  \n- Increased **specificity and reduced complexity** in risk disclosures indicate enhanced transparency and clearer communication to stakeholders.  \n- Strong operational cash flows have enabled debt repayments and balance sheet strengthening, positioning the company well for continued sustainable growth with **improving liquidity and leverage metrics**.",

We earned the licence to be part of people's lives by caring about the things that they care about, and understanding the challenges they face. Olusegun Ogunsanya Chief executive officer Strategic report 14 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2022 This has been an important year for Airtel Africa, in which our continued strong financial performance has meant we could make further progress on our purpose of transforming lives. The growth in all our services speaks for itself: we have grown underlying revenues in data by 34.6%, in voice services by 15.4%, and in mobile money by 34.9% in constant currency. Reported revenue grew by 20.6% to $4,714m. It is to the credit of everyone at Airtel Africa that we'five continued to provide essential services in all our markets throughout the year, and to serve more customers than ever before, reaching 128.4 million in total. But when you look beyond these figures there is growth of a kind that is equally, or even more important. In October 2021 we launched our sustainability strategy, which builds on the work we have done for years in the societies and communities where we live and operate. It has four focused pillars - each with specific and measurable goals or commitments - designed to help develop a sustainable future for individuals, families, communities and businesses across Africa. The progress we have made to start delivering on these commitments is described on pages 43-58 - and I'd like to thank Airtel Africa's people and all our stakeholders for helping make this possible. Succeeding by serving customers and communities Our strong business performance reinforces our belief that serving and empowering customers and their communities is the only way to success. The nature of our services means we are always close to our customers - part of their daily lives, of their family connections, and of the way they interact with the economy and the world. We must continue to earn the right to that relationship every day - the licence to be part of people's lives. We do that by caring about the things that they care about, and understanding the challenges they face: challenges such as climate change, a lack of access to basic education and healthcare services, poor infrastructure in rural areas that restrict digital communication, and financial inclusion. This has never been more relevant than during the Covid-19 pandemic, which has hit hard among the markets we serve. This year again meant doing business in ways that safeguarded our people and customers, and continuing to provide essential services. Economies and societies are now recovering from that impact - but there is still a need for businesses like ours to invest in the future of our communities. This year, we announced a five-year partnership with UNICEF to help accelerate digital learning. By providing equal access to quality digital learning, particularly for the most vulnerable children, the partnership will help to ensure that every child reaches their full potential. We were the first African private sector partner to make a multi-million dollar commitment to UNICEF's 'Reimagine education' initiative, and our $57m financial and in-kind contribution over five years will benefit learners in Chad, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. There is always more we can do, though, to increase our positive social and environmental impact. In the year ahead we will continue to work on our net zero ambition and on the other key pillars of our sustainability strategy - which include expanding financial inclusion and digitalisation for customers across the region, as well as working to make sure our own employees continue to enjoy a work culture that is inclusive and rewarding. Strengthening our 'Win with' strategy Formally embedding our sustainability goals into everything we do has strengthened our business strategy for the future. That strategy continues to be underpinned by the key trends we see in our markets: a continuous and expanding demand for data, mobile money and mobile services from young, growing populations who are underserved by infrastructure, especially in remote rural areas. We succeed by providing affordable, transparent telecoms services in a sustainable manner, reducing the digital divide and enhancing financial inclusion. We have leading positions in many of our markets, but like any business we should always be alive to our competitive environment - whether that competition comes from telecoms businesses, or from FinTech companies. One of our key assets continues to be our exclusive distribution network - which gives us the ability to win and stay close to our customers. This year our total Airtel Money branches and kiosks has grown to over 16,000 and 53,000, respectively. We have also added digitalisation as an overarching strategic intent - because further digitising our services, creating digital products, and digitising our own processes will play a vital role in our success, increasing the attractiveness and efficiency of our offer, and building 'stickiness', which helps us retain our customers. At the same time, we continuously build on our network in rural areas and improve quality and capacity in urban areas. This year we added more than 3,400 sites, taking our total sites to 28,797, of which 87.6% are on 4G. Our fibre network has now reached over 64,500 km. And we continue to focus on the mobile money opportunity, which is closely aligned with our ambition of supporting financial inclusion in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals UN SDGs. Our mobile money customers grew by 20.7% during the year, while strategic partnerships, cross-border money transfers and digital payments, including merchant payments, have helped grow our mobile money transaction value by 37.0%, and mobile money revenues by 34.9%. Our progress against our 'Win with' strategy is described in full on pages 31-42 T ransforming lives Successful delivery of our strategy this year has meant that our provision of essential services to customers and communities has driven our profitable growth, which in turn fuels our ability to keep advancing our sustainability ambitions. This would not be possible without our stakeholders, including the governments of the countries in which we operate, who recognise the value we bring to their own goals for building a digital, inclusive economy, and with whom we aim to work in partnership on sustainable development. Above all, of course, it would not be possible without the hard work of Airtel Africa people and the support of stakeholders. I'd like to thank them again for their efforts as, together, we continue to transform lives. Olusegun Ogunsanya Chief executive officer 10 May 2022 15 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2022 Strategic report Business review Nigeria is a country where demand for data and mobile services is strong and growing stronger, and where the government continues to see digital entrepreneurship as an engine of economic progress.

It is a country where demand for data and mobile services is strong and growing stronger, and where the government continues to see digital entrepreneurship as an engine of economic progress. We aim to join with and support our customers through this transformation, and this year we'five made further investments in network upgrades to boost capacity and reinforce resilience. At the same time we'five continued to expand our distribution network, while developing our offer to customers. We're also helping people move along the ladder from 2G to 3G to 4G: in particular, we'five expanded our 4G footprint by 34.2% to reach more communities to support digital transformation and drive economic empowerment. This year has seen us create centres where new customers can get SIM registrations and register under the National Identity Number NIN regulations introduced in December 2020. As of April 2022, we had collated NIN information for 35.9 million of our active customer base. This supported the government's implementation of the scheme while easing the delay in registration that many customers experienced in FY'21. In April 2022, we were also notified that all SIMs that had not been linked to a NIN would have outgoing voice calls barred with immediate effect. Subscribers can still link their SIMs to their NINs in order that these restrictions can be lifted. Outgoing voice revenues for active subscribers who have not yet linked their NIN with their SIM amount to around 7% of our total revenues from Nigeria. We continue to work closely with the regulator and will make every effort to minimise disruption and ensure customers benefit from full service connectivity as soon as possible. We're also developing our mobile money offer. In April 2022, Airtel Africa received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN to offer services under a super-agent licence and under a Payment Service Bank PSB licence. This follows the issue by the Central Bank of Nigeria of the approval in principle in respect of the two licences in November 2021. We are getting ready to launch both services as guided by the Central Bank, allowing Airtel Africa to create an agency network to serve the customers of licensed Nigerian banks, payment service banks, and licensed mobile money operators in Nigeria, as described on page 23. There have been challenges at times during the year. The Covid-19 pandemic has continued to have an impact on customers and communities, with lockdowns in some regions. We'five also closely monitored Nigeria's foreign exchange situation: our analysis of foreign exchange risk is described on page 85. Overall, however, this has been another year of growth, with our customer base growing by 5.8%, and revenues by 27.7% in constant currency. Our performance Reported currency revenue grew by 21.0% to $1,878m with constant currency growth of 27.7%. The differential in growth rates was due to devaluation of the Nigerian naira by 5.6%. The constant currency revenue growth of 27.7% was driven by both customer base growth of 5.8% and ARPU growth of 33.0% largely driven by higher data and voice usage. Voice revenue grew by 15.9%, driven by an increase in voice usage per customer of 20.8% which led to an ARPU increase of 20.7%. Customer base growth was affected by the NIN-SIM linkage regulations in Nigeria during the first half of the year but returned to growth, adding 4 million customers in the second half of the year, achieving net growth of 2.4 million customers over the full year. The number of regulatory approved outlets expanded to over 19,100 as of 31 March 2022. Data revenue grew by 41.1% in constant currency, driven by data customer base growth of 14.9% and data ARPU growth of 37.6%, led by growth in data usage per customer to 4.0 GB per month from 2.8 GB in the prior year. Our continued 4G network expansion and increased smartphone penetration has supported data usage growth. Almost 99% of our sites in Nigeria are now delivering 4G, and smartphone penetration of our customers has increased by almost 1 percentage point. Data revenue accounted for 39.1% of total revenue in Nigeria in the year, up by 3.7% on the prior year. For Q4'22, 43.6% of our data customer base were 4G users, contributing to 76.0% of total data usage. Data usage per customer reached 4.2 GB per month and 4G data usage per customer reached 6.5 GB per month, a significant increase on the 4.6 GB usage per customer per month of Q4'21. Other revenue grew by 58.2%, with the main contribution coming from the growth in value added services revenue, led by airtime credit services. Underlying EBITDA was $1,037m, growing by 23.6% in reported currency and representing constant currency growth of 30.4%. Underlying EBITDA margin improved to 55.2%, an increase of 115 basis points in reported currency and 114 basis points in constant currency, as a result of improvements in operational efficiency. Operating free cash flow was $786m, up by 50.7% in constant currency, due to the expansion of underlying EBITDA. Transforming lives spotlight Harnessing entrepreneurship, creating value Adeleye Adetimilehin typifies the entrepreneurial spirit on which our distribution network depends - as well as the positive economic impact our business can have in our communities. Made redundant from his last job but determined to support his family, Mr. Adetimilehin enrolled as a freelance Airtel Field Sales Agent in 2016. His performance quickly earned him an accreditation as an Airtel SIM distributor, operating in Benin city, Edo State. Focusing only on subscriber acquisition, Mr. Adetimilehin made rapid progress and set up his own company, Aleyetonto Nigeria Ltd, which deals exclusively with Airtel Africa business - and by December 2021 he controlled 10 Airtel Africa shops, employed 18 people and grossed around N100m over $200,000 monthly, activating an average of 20,000 new subscriptions through his network each month. Inspired by our 'Touching lives' programme, Mr. Adetimilehin has also developed his own ways to give back to the community, supporting widows, youths and vulnerable people in his area. 63 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2022 Strategic report Chief financial officer's introduction to the financial review Strengthening our balance sheet and seizing growth opportunities The effective execution of our strategy resulted in a strong performance across all our regional segments and key services this year, enabling us to continue creating value for our stakeholders. We continued to deliver strong revenue growth and even stronger underlying EBITDA growth, with improved profitability coming from both scale benefits and increased efficiencies. The countries we operate in continue to present clear opportunities, both for our growth, and for our vision of enriching the lives of our customers. Our markets remain underpenetrated in both mobile and mobile money services, and our strategy is delivering strong financial results while helping to bridge digital divides and drive financial inclusion.

Growing our operating profitability We continued to invest in improving our operating profitability by driving higher revenue growth and, through our focus on operating efficiencies, improving our underlying EBITDA flowthrough. Underlying EBITDA margin improved by 294 basis points to 49.0% and operating profit during the year grew by 37.2% in reported currency, with constant currency growth of 39.4%. Improving our return on capital We continually monitor our return on capital to ensure that our capex has been deployed efficiently and effectively. Telcoms is a capitalintensive business, so regular monitoring of our return on capital helps us track the performance of our assets while also taking long-term financing into consideration. Our return on capital employed has improved to 23.3%, from 16.5% in the prior year. Strengthening our balance sheet and improving leverage Our short-term objective is to strengthen our balance sheet by continually reducing our debt at Holdco level, increase debt in our OpCos and reduce our leverage position. I am please we delivered on all 3 objectives. In the last 12 months, we repaid a $915m bond when due in May 2021, and in March 2022 repaid $505m bonds one year earlier than their March 2023 redemption date. We were able to make these repayments because of our increased cash generation, and by using the proceeds from Airtel Money minority investments and tower sales. Our leverage position continued to improve 1.3x as of March 2022 driven both by EBITDA expansion and reducing our debt. Finally, our balance sheet continued to be fide-risked through a reduction of net debt and increased localisation of our debt into the OpCos, such that our gross OpCo debt of $2,921m is now higher than our remaining HoldCo debt of $1,000m. Going forward we will continue to focus on continuing strengthening our balance sheet. Returns to shareholders Our fourth financial objective was to enhance returns to shareholders over the mediumto longer-term. During the year, the Board approved an upgrade to the progressive dividend policy, aiming to grow the dividend annually by a midto high-single-digit percentage from a new base of 5 cents per share for FY'22. We paid an interim dividend of 2 cents per ordinary share in December 2021. The Board recommended a final dividend of 3 cents per share and increase of 25% compared to the prior year. Basic EPS was 16.8 cents, an improvement of 7.8 cents, up from 9.0 cents in the prior period. Outlook Our dynamic business model continues to deliver value to all our stakeholders, not just financially but by transforming lives in our communities and supporting the economies of the countries where we operate. We believe that the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we remain well positioned to seize growth opportunities while at the same time continuing to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our return on capital and increase return to shareholders. Jaideep Paul Chief financial officer 10 May 2022 Reported revenue grew by 20.6% to $4,714m and constant currency underlying revenue grew 23.3% for the year. Constant currency underlying revenue growth was strong in all regions: Nigeria up 27.7%, East Africa up 22.7% and Francophone Africa up 17.2%: and across all key services, with revenue in Voice up 15.4%, Data up 34.6% and Mobile Money up 34.9%. Underlying EBITDA of $2,311m, grew by 29.0% in reported currency. Underlying EBITDA margin of 49.0%, increased by 294 basis points. Operating profit grew by 37.2% to $1,535m in reported currency. Profit after tax grew by 82.0% to $755m. Basic EPS of 16.8 cents, an increase of 86.5%. EPS before exceptional items of 16.0 cents FY'21: 8.2 cents. Operating free cash flow of $1,655m, up 40.5%, with net cash generated from operating activities up 20.7% to $2,011m. Over the last twelve months the business has repaid nearly $1.4bn of debt at Holdco as a result of strong cash upstreaming across its OpCos and proceeds from minority investments in mobile money and tower sales. Leverage ratio improved to 1.3x from 2.0x in the prior year, with $1bn of debt now held at HoldCo FY'21: $2.4bn. Customer base of 128.4 million, up 8.7%, with increased penetration across mobile data customer base up 15.2% and mobile money services customer base up 20.7%. NIN SIM regulations in Nigeria impacted customer growth in H1, but then returned to strong growth, adding 4 million customers in Nigeria during H2'22. The Board recommends a final dividend of 3 cents per share, making total FY'22 dividend 5 cents per share FY'21: 4 cents. Performance highlights 75 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2022 Strategic report Financial review GAAP measures Revenue Reported revenue grew by 20.6% to $4,714m. The prior year benefited from a one-time exceptional revenue of $20m relating to a settlement in Niger. Excluding this, revenue grew by 21.3% in reported currency and by 23.3% in constant currency. Constant currency growth of 23.3% was partially offset by currency devaluations, mainly in the Nigerian naira 5.6% and the Malawian kwacha 7.2%, in turn partially offset by appreciation in the Ugandan shilling 4.1% and Zambian kwacha 4.4%. Revenue growth for the year benefited from a weakened performance in the first quarter of the prior year during the peak period of Covid-19 restrictions across the region. Underlying revenue $m FY'22 FY'21 4,714 20.6% 14.2% 3,908 1 Revenue includes one-time exceptional revenue of $20m relating to a settlement in Niger in the year ended March 2021 2 Growth % in reported currency Operating profit Operating profit grew by 37.2% to $1,535m in reported currency as a result of strong revenue growth and improvements in operating efficiency across all our regions. Operating profit included a one-time cost of $32m consisting of a $12m provision for expected settlement of a contractual dispute in which one of Group's subsidiaries is a party, and $20m costs relating to an agreement on historic spectrum fees in one of the Group's subsidiaries. This compared to the prior year which included a gain of $20m for a one-time settlement in Niger, which was partially offset by one-off costs of $6m in Francophone Africa. Excluding exceptional items, operating profit grew by 41.9%. Operating profit $m FY'22 FY'21 1,535 37.2% 24.2% 1,119 Growth % in reported currency Net finance costs Net finance costs were broadly flat, as lower foreign exchange and derivative losses, higher interest income and a one-time $12m gain in other finance charges as a result of the reversal of an interest provision in one of our operating entities were offset by a one-off cost of $19m for the applicable premium paid on the early repayment of the $505m bonds in March 2022. Additionally, interest costs were also broadly flat as lower interest costs on our reduced market debt were offset by an increase in interest costs on lease liabilities. The Group effective interest rate increased to 5.6% compared to 4.9%, largely driven by repayment of the EUR750m bond in May 2021, which carried a lower-than-average coupon, and due to higher local currency debt at the OpCo level. In line with our strategy to continue to reduce foreign currency debt at Holdco, we also repaid $505m bonds in March 2022, one year earlier than their March 2023 redemption date. One-off costs of $19m, including applicable premium, have been recorded under non-operating exceptional items, while the Group will save an aggregate of c. $26m on interest payments from the early redemption. Taxation Total tax charges were $469m, an increase of $187m, driven by higher operating profit and withholding tax on dividends by subsidiaries. The prior year also benefited from the recognition of a deferred tax credit of $36m in Tanzania. Profit after tax Profit after tax increased by 82.0% to $755m. This increase was mainly led by higher operating profits and stable net finance costs which more than offset the associated increase in tax charges. Exceptional gains were also $12m higher than the prior year. Basic EPS Basic EPS climbed to 16.8 cents, an improvement of 7.8 cents 86.5% from 9.0 cents in the prior year. This increase was mainly due to higher operating profits which more than offset increased tax charges and higher non-controlling interests due to higher profit contributions in OpCos with minority shareholdings, new minority shareholdings in Airtel Money partially offset by lower minority interests in Airtel Nigeria as a result of the successful share buy-back. Net cash generated from operating activities Net cash generated from operating activities was $2,011m, an increase of 20.7% from $1,666m in the prior period. The increase was largely driven by higher profit before tax of $527m, which was partially offset by higher tax payments on the increased profits and withholding tax on dividends by subsidiaries. Over the last twelve months the business has repaid nearly $1.4bn of debt at Holdco as a result of strong cash upstreaming across its OpCos and proceeds from minority investments in mobile money and tower sales. Alternative performance measures Underlying revenue Underlying revenue in constant currency grew by 23.3%, driven by both customer base growth of 8.7% and ARPU growth of 15.4%. The slowdown in customer base growth was due to the introduction of new SIM registration regulations in Nigeria. Excluding Nigeria, the customer base grew by 10.2%. In Nigeria, our customer base returned to growth in the second half of the year, adding a net 2.4 million Strategic report 76 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2022 Profit after tax $m 415 March '21 reported profit after tax March '22 reported profit after tax March '21 profit after tax excluding exceptional items Operating profit Finance cost Tax March '22 profit after tax excluding exceptional items March '22 exceptional items 50 March '21 exceptional items 365 19 693 755 462 153 62 MARCH 2021 MARCH 2022 customers for the full year. At the end of the year our total customer base was 128.4 million, an increase of 10.2 million. ARPU growth of 15.4% was driven by all our key services: with data contributing 7.7%, voice contributing 4.3%, mobile money contributing 2.7%, and the balance coming from other revenue, which was marginally impacted in Q4 from the loss of tower sharing revenues relating to towers sold during the year. Revenue growth was recorded across all our regions and key services. Underlying revenue in Nigeria grew by 27.7%, in East Africa by 22.7%, and in Francophone Africa by 17.2%. Voice revenue grew by 15.4%, data revenue grew by 34.6% and mobile money revenue grew by 34.9% in constant currency. Underlying EBITDA Underlying EBITDA was $2,311m, an increase of 29.0% in reported currency and of 31.2% in constant currency. Growth in underlying EBITDA was led by revenue growth and supported by improved operating efficiencies. The underlying EBITDA margin improved by 294 basis points in reported currency to 49.0%. Foreign exchange had an adverse impact of $58m on revenue, and $26m on underlying EBITDA, as a result of devaluations of the Nigerian naira and the Malawian kwacha, in turn partially offset by appreciations of both the Ugandan shilling and the Zambian kwacha. With respect to currency devaluation sensitivity, on a 12-month basis, a 1% currency devaluation across all currencies in our OpCos would have a negative impact of $43m on revenues, $26m on underlying EBITDA and $21m on finance costs. Our largest exposure is to the Nigerian naira, for which a 1% devaluation would have a negative impact of $18m on revenues, $11m on underlying EBITDA and $7m on finance costs. Underlying EBITDA $m FY'22 FY'21 2,311 49.0% 46.1% 1,792 EBITDA margin % Tax The effective tax rate was 39.0% compared to 43.2% in the prior period, largely due to profit mix changes amongst the OpCos. The effective tax rate is higher than the weighted average statutory corporate tax rate of approximately 33%, largely due to the profit mix between various OpCos and withholding taxes on dividends by subsidiaries. Exceptional items Operating exceptional items of $32m in the year ended 31 March 2022 consists of a $12m provision for expected settlement of a contractual dispute in which one of the Group's subsidiaries is a party and $20m costs of agreeing historic spectrum fees in one of the Group's subsidiaries. The prior period operating exceptional items includes exceptional revenue on account of a one-time settlement in Niger amounting to $20m, partially offset by a one-off cost of $6m in Francophone Africa. Non-operating exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2022 include a gain of $111m on the sale of telecommunications tower assets in the Group's subsidiaries in Tanzania, Malawi, Madagascar, and Rwanda, partially offset by one-off cost of $19m including applicable premium paid on the early repayment of $505m bonds in March 2022. Exceptional tax benefit of $2m recognised in the year mainly relate to the provision for the contractual dispute in which one of the Group's subsidiaries is a party, and the $36m in the prior year relates to deferred tax credit recognition in Tanzania. EPS before exceptional items EPS before exceptional items almost doubled to 16.0 cents, up by 96.0% 7.8 cents from 8.2 cents in the prior year. This increase was mainly due to higher operating profits which more than offset the increased tax charges and higher non-controlling interests due to higher profit contributions in OpCos with minority shareholdings, new minority shareholdings in Airtel Money partially offset by lower minority interests in Airtel Nigeria as a result of the successful share buy-back.

Capital expenditure in the prior year was slightly lower due to logistical challenges as a result of the pandemic. Strategic investment and asset monetisation We received a minority investment of $550m from four investors in Airtel Mobile Commerce B. V. The Rise Fund invested $200m, Mastercard $100m, Qatar Holding LLC QIA $200m and $50m from Chimera Investment LLC.

We also continue to pursue further potential sales of our tower assets in Chad and Gabon. Leverage and balance sheet measures Leverage net debt to underlying EBITDA improved to 1.3x at 31 March 2022, from 2.0x at 31 March 2021, largely driven by increased cash generation, expansion in underlying EBITDA and receipts of $550m from mobile money minority investments. Our balance sheet continued to be fide-risked through a reduction of HoldCo debt now $1bn, down from $2.4bn in the prior year and increased localisation of our debt into the OpCos, such that our gross OpCo debt of $2,921m including lease obligations is now significantly higher than our HoldCo debt of $1,000m.

Dividend paid to shareholders During the year, the Board approved an upgrade to the progressive dividend policy, aiming to grow the dividend annually by a midto high-single-digit percentage from a new base of 5 cents per share for FY'22. Final dividend payment of 2.5 cents per ordinary share for year ended 31 March 2021 was paid during the year and an interim dividend payment of 2 cents per ordinary share. The Board recommended a final dividend of 3 cents per share for year ended 31 March 2022. Proceeds from sale of shares to non-controlling interests In line with the Group's pursuit of strategic investment in our mobile money business, we received a minority investment of $550m from four investors in Airtel Mobile Commerce B. V. - refer to Note 5 g of consolidated statement of financial position as set out on page 178 for details. Proceeds from sale of tower assets With the focus on an asset-light business model and on its core subscriber-facing operations, the Group has received proceeds of $251m from the sale of tower assets in Tanzania, Malawi, Madagascar and Rwanda. Refer to Notes 5 c to 5 f of consolidated statement of financial position as set out on page 177-178 for details. Acquisition of non-controlling interest During the year Airtel Networks Limited 'Airtel Nigeria', a subsidiary of Airtel Africa plc, completed the buy-back of 8.22% non-controlling interest out of an existing 8.26% from minority shareholders for a consideration of $163m including directly attributable transaction costs. Refer to Note 5 h of consolidated statement of financial position on page 178 for details. Foreign exchange on borrowings and cash flows Foreign exchange on borrowings and cash flows primarily represents loss on account of restatement of EUR bonds due to appreciation of euro against US dollar. Financial information by service We provide performance data for our mobile voice and data services and Airtel Money in our business review on pages 68-71. Financial information by market We provide performance data for each of our markets in our business review on pages 62-67. Strategic report 78 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2022 Consolidated statement of financial position The consolidated statement of financial position is set out on page 163. Details on the major movements of our assets and liabilities in the year are set out on this page. Assets Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment including capital work in progress increased by $171m to $2,403m. This was due to capital expenditure of $646m linked to continued investment in network assets, which was partially offset by $418m of depreciation and sale of the tower assets. Right of use assets Right of use assets increased by $310m to $1,109m. The increase of $539m was due to the capitalisation of the present value of telecommunication towers taken on long-term lease including additional sale and lease back in four markets, partially offset by $211m of depreciation. Deferred tax assets net Deferred tax assets decreased by $92m mainly due to utilisation of deferred tax assets in Airtel Nigeria on account of improved taxable profits. Balance held under mobile money trust The balance held under mobile money trust represents the funds of mobile money customers which are not available for use by the Group, and these have increased by $73m. Total equity and liabilities Total equity Total equity increased by $296m to $3,649m. This was linked to the $755m profit for the period, partially offset by $169m dividend to shareholders of Airtel Africa, the $164m impact of the buy-back of an 8.22% non-controlling interest in Airtel Nigeria and $76m dividend to minority shareholders in subsidiaries. Borrowings Gross borrowings including short-term borrowings reduced by $684m to $3,932m. This was largely due to repayment of a $915m bond which was due in May 2021 and prepayment of $505m bonds one year earlier than their March 2023 redemption date, offset by an increase in lease liabilities by $383m and the drawdown of an external loan. Net debt of the Group as of 31 March 2022 was $2,941m. Non-current liabilities Non-current liabilities excluding borrowings increased by $592m. This was largely due to the recording of a put option liability at the present value of the expected buy-back amount relating to investments by the Rise Fund and Mastercard into AMC B. V. Current liabilities Current liabilities excluding borrowings increased by $168m to $1,964m. This was largely due to a $64m increase in mobile money wallet balance, consistent with the growth in mobile money cash as described above and a $47m increase in current tax liabilities net. Further details of the Group's liquidity position and going concern assessment are shown on page 166, Note 2.2 of the financial statements. Dividends The Board has recommended a final dividend of 3 cents per ordinary share for the year ended 31 March 2022. The proposed final dividend will be paid on 22 July 2022 to all ordinary shareholders who are on the register of members at the close of business on 24 June 2022. We will announce more details in due course. We paid an interim dividend of 2 cents per ordinary share in December 2021.

        "Detailed Analysis of ROE": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is ROE increasing or declining?**  \n  The **ROE** has slightly declined from **0.107 (previous year)** to **0.104 (current year)**, indicating a marginal reduction in the company's ability to generate returns on equity.\n\n- **Is growth in ROE higher than that of competitors and the industry?**  \n  The report does not provide explicit competitor or industry **ROE** benchmarks. However, given the slight decline in **ROE**, it is unlikely that the company outperformed industry peers in terms of equity return growth during the period.\n\n- **Is growth persistent or temporary?**  \n  The decline in **ROE** is marginal and the company shows strong revenue growth (19.4% constant currency) and expanding profitability (underlying EBITDA margin improved by 210bps). This suggests that the minor dip in **ROE** could be temporary, possibly influenced by investments or external factors like currency fluctuations mentioned in the report.\n\n# Forecasts:\n- **Expected ROE next year:** Given the company's continued focus on deleveraging, revenue growth, and margin improvement, **ROE** is likely to stabilize or modestly improve, forecasted around **0.105 to 0.110**, assuming no major external shocks.\n\n# Summary:\n- The company\u2019s **ROE** declined slightly from **0.107** to **0.104**, reflecting a minor reduction in equity efficiency despite strong top-line growth.  \n- Strong operational performance is evident with **underlying revenue growth of 19.4%** (constant currency) and an **expanded EBITDA margin of 46.1%**, suggesting core profitability improvements.  \n- The slight decline in **ROE** may relate to increased capital deployment in licence renewals and spectrum acquisition, plus foreign exchange pressures, which are expected to be temporary.  \n- The company\u2019s strategy to reduce leverage (net debt to EBITDA improved to 2.0x) and monetize assets should support future return enhancements.  \n- Currency devaluations, especially in Nigeria, pose a risk to the **ROE** but management is actively mitigating through natural hedging and financial discipline.  \n- Growth in customer base and mobile money services drives revenue diversification, potentially supporting sustainable **ROE** growth.  \n- The company\u2019s investments in network expansion and digital services are expected to translate into improved capital efficiency over time.  \n- The Board\u2019s progressive dividend policy aligned with deleveraging signals confidence in long-term return generation.  \n- Overall, the company demonstrates resilience and a strong strategic position in a high-growth but volatile market environment.  \n- Key risks include currency fluctuations and regulatory changes that could affect future profitability and consequently **ROE**.",
        "Detailed Analysis of ROE Drivers": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?**  \n  The growth in **ROE** is primarily driven by an increase in **Asset Turnover** from **2.01** to **2.15**, indicating improved efficiency in using assets to generate revenue. However, the **Profit Margin** has declined from **10.76%** to **8.65%**, showing a decrease in profitability per unit of revenue. This suggests that the increase in ROE is driven mainly by efficiency gains rather than margin improvement.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  Based on the textual report, **Airtel Africa** shows strong revenue growth, expanding customer base, and improving network infrastructure, which likely contributes to the rising **Asset Turnover**. However, the decline in **Profit Margin** could be due to increased costs related to network expansion, Covid-19-related expenses, and regulatory impacts. The report mentions competitive markets in sub-Saharan Africa with key competitors such as MTN and Vodacom. While the company leads in 4G coverage and network distribution, the **Profit Margin** decline may reflect industry pricing pressures and operational costs typical in emerging markets. Without explicit competitor margin ratios, it is reasonable to infer that **efficiency (Asset Turnover)** is a stronger competitive advantage for Airtel Africa than margin.\n\n---\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year:** Given ongoing investments in network expansion and distribution channels, **Asset Turnover** is expected to **increase modestly to around 2.20**, reflecting continued efficient use of assets.  \n- **Expected Profit Margin next year:** As the company manages Covid-19 costs and achieves operational efficiencies, **Profit Margin** is forecasted to **stabilize or marginally improve to approximately 9-9.5%**, though still below prior year levels.\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The **increase in ROE** is mainly driven by the **improvement in Asset Turnover**, reflecting Airtel Africa's growing operational efficiency and expanding customer base.  \n- The **Profit Margin decline** indicates pressure on profitability, likely due to increased costs from network upgrades, regulatory fees, and the ongoing effects of the pandemic.  \n- The company's **strength lies in its asset efficiency**, supported by expanding 4G coverage and distribution, which should continue to drive growth. Profitability is expected to recover gradually as cost controls improve and scale benefits accrue.",
        "Detailed Analysis of Risk": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Are risks increasing or declining?**  \n  The **NLP financial risk** slightly declined from **2.28** to **2.16**, and **NLP legal risk** decreased from **1.23** to **1.0**, indicating some reduction in financial and legal risks. However, **NLP tax risk** rose from **1.82** to **2.16**, showing increased tax-related risk. Overall, risks are mixed but show a slight decline in general financial and legal risk, with tax risk increasing.\n\n- **Is the number and severity of risks higher than competitors/industry?**  \n  The textual report emphasizes regulatory and foreign exchange risks, particularly in Nigeria, which is a large market for the company, and ongoing challenges like Covid-19. Although exact competitor data is not provided, the company's active risk management and mitigations suggest risks are typical for the industry but with some heightened exposure due to geographic and regulatory factors.\n\n- **Is sentiment increasing or declining?**  \n  The **NLP sentiment** is not explicitly provided, but the **NLP sentence length** increased from **31.88** to **33.93** and **sentence depth** from **6.74** to **7.18**, indicating more detailed and possibly more cautious or complex disclosures, which often correlate with more nuanced or slightly cautious sentiment.\n\n- **Is specificity increasing or declining?**  \n  The **NLP specificity** slightly declined from **0.106** to **0.104**, suggesting a minor decrease in the precision or detail in risk disclosures.\n\n- **Are complexity measures increasing or declining?**  \n  Both **sentence length** (33.93 vs 31.88) and **sentence depth** (7.18 vs 6.74) increased, indicating the risk disclosures have become more complex and detailed.\n\n- **How are sentiment, specificity, and complexity compared to competitors?**  \n  Without direct competitor data, the increased complexity and slightly reduced specificity suggest the company is providing more elaborate risk discussion but with slightly less pinpointed detail, which is common in large, diversified telecom companies facing regulatory and operational risks.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Is Gearing expected to increase next year?**  \n  Given the increase from **1.74** to **1.88**, and ongoing investments and debt repayments discussed in the report, **Gearing is likely to continue to increase moderately** unless offset by significant asset monetization.\n\n- **Is Current Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The current ratio declined from **0.67** to **0.54**, indicating tighter liquidity. Without clear signals of improved short-term assets or reduced current liabilities, **Current Ratio is expected to remain low or possibly decline further**.\n\n- **Is Quick Ratio expected to increase next year?**  \n  The quick ratio also declined from **0.54** to **0.44**, following the current ratio trend, so **Quick Ratio is expected to remain subdued or decrease unless liquidity management improves**.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The company's **overall financial and legal risks show a slight decline**, although **tax risk has increased**, reflecting evolving tax challenges in its markets.  \n- Risk disclosures have become **more complex and detailed**, but **specificity has marginally decreased**, indicating a more cautious, nuanced approach to reporting risks.  \n- Financial liquidity ratios (**current and quick ratios**) have worsened, signaling tighter short-term liquidity, while **gearing has increased**, suggesting higher leverage.  \n- The company maintains **robust risk mitigation strategies**, including asset monetization and strategic investments to manage foreign exchange and regulatory risks, as highlighted in the report.  \n- **Sentiment inferred from disclosures is likely more cautious and detailed**, matching the challenging operating environment described.  \n- Compared to competitors (though direct data is lacking), the company appears to align with industry norms in risk exposure but with notable geographic and regulatory complexities.  \n- The **increase in gearing** alongside **declining liquidity ratios** requires monitoring to ensure financial flexibility.  \n- The company\u2019s **risk management and governance practices are strong**, supporting long-term viability despite external challenges.  \n- The **textual report and financial ratios together show a company navigating significant risks with transparency but facing moderate financial pressure on liquidity**.  \n- Overall, risk disclosures reflect **a mature approach balancing transparency with strategic caution**.",

By consistently focusing on serving our customers, we transform lives and communities while delivering sustainable, profitable growth. Sunil Bharti Mittal Chair Strategic report 8 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: ChairmansXstatement v32 Modification Date: 25 May 2021 4:47 pm Many of our customers and their communities faced difficult and tragic times over the last year. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a deep impact on people's lives and livelihoods across Africa, as it has everywhere in the world. This crisis is not over, though there are promising signs in terms of treatment and vaccination, and the World Bank and other experts predict a return to GDP growth in Africa in 2021. It is clear that just as data and telecoms services have been essential to people and economies during the pandemic, they will play a vital role in the recovery across sub-Saharan Africa. I know that everyone at Airtel Africa is rightly proud of the work we have done to maintain our services over the last year, and to keep serving our customers throughout the crisis. For millions of people across the continent, our services have been a vital link - to family and loved ones, to their businesses and livelihoods, and to the wider economy. It has been a year in which Airtel Africa employees have been true to our core value, 'Respectful': 'We live the same lives as our customers, sharing the same joys and the same pains'. And as we support the recovery and open up opportunities through financial inclusion and digital empowerment, we will continue to serve our purpose of transforming lives. A resilient business, focused on colleagues and customers Throughout the year, the Board has been confident that the business has had the right measures in place to protect our colleagues, who have adapted to new ways of working so that we could continue to provide vital services and create value for all our stakeholders. We have also supported the extensive work carried out to help our customers, and the programmes put in place to address urgent needs in our markets, many of which are described on page 16. By supporting vital services in education and healthcare, and by working closely with governments to keep networks operational and make mobile money services more available, we have shown that not only are our own operations resilient, but we contribute to the resilience of those around us. Serving customers to deliver growth and strengthen our balance sheet The year has also shown the resilience of our strategy. We have always aimed to create a model for providing affordable telecoms services that is sustainable as well as profitable. That means taking account of the challenges presented by geography and infrastructure, mitigating our risks, including foreign exchange risks, and growing revenue faster than the markets in our footprint through a continuous focus on serving customers' needs. Our revenue growth of 14.2% in reported currency in 2020 21 demonstrates this strategy in action. At the same time, we have a longstanding focus on strengthening our balance sheet. Our leverage net debt to underlying EBITDA improved to 2.0x 2.1x as of 31 March 2020. Our aim is to continue to reduce our leverage ratio, and keep it below 2.0x. During the year, the Board approved a new progressive dividend policy, which aims to grow the dividend annually by a midto highsingle-digit percentage from a base of 4 cents per share for financial year 2020 21, until reported leverage falls below 2.0x. We paid an interim dividend of 1.5 cents per ordinary share in December 2020. The Board has recommended a final dividend of 2.5 cents per share. In March 2021, we took an important step by welcoming both The Rise Fund and Mastercard as investors in our mobile money business. The Rise Fund will invest $200m and Mastercard will invest $100m in Airtel Mobile Commerce BV AMC BV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Airtel Africa plc. This is part of our pursuit of asset monetisation opportunities, and we aim to explore the potential listing of the mobile money business within four years. At the same time, we welcome The Rise Fund and Mastercard as partners in our ambition of banking the unbanked across Africa. This investment is described on page 47. Meeting the Board's priorities Strong governance remains a core focus of the Board. We were pleased to welcome Kelly Bayer Rosmarin as a non-executive director when Arthur Lang stepped down in October 2020 - both are nominees of Singtel. We announced on 29 April 2021 that Olusegun Segun Ogunsanya, managing director and chief executive officer of Airtel Nigeria, is to succeed Raghunath Raghu Mandava as managing director and chief executive officer of Airtel Africa plc following Raghu's informing of the Board of his intention to retire. Segun will join the Board of Airtel Africa plc with effect from 1 October 2021. On behalf of the Board I would like to thank Raghu for being instrumental in successfully leading and transforming Airtel Africa into a powerhouse telecoms and mobile money company. Throughout that time, Raghu has worked tirelessly, first to repair and then to strengthen Airtel Africa's business, and to champion our stakeholders. As we look forward to Segun assuming his new role in October 2021, we do so from a position of great strength as a result of Raghu's highly effective stewardship. Raghu will retire from the Board with our very best wishes and sincere appreciation for everything he has achieved. We also announced on the same day that Jaideep Paul, chief financial officer, has been appointed as an Executive director and will join the Board of Airtel Africa plc with effect from 1 June 2021. The company is committed to ensuring that the Board membership continues to reflect the diversity, breadth of skills and experience required to drive and support the business strategy going forward. I am pleased with our continuing efforts to build on our effective governance structure, described in more detail on pages 90-99. Making sure our success is sustainable, for us and others Our business has always understood that the markets we operate in have powerful and promising underlying macroeconomic and demographic trends, and that meeting the demand in underserved markets goes hand in hand with addressing the challenges faced by the millions of people who still lack access to effective communications infrastructure, data services, and to financial services. As well as investing in our networks and distribution channels to bring us closer to customers, and enabling financial inclusion through our mobile money services, the business has consistently delivered targeted programmes in areas such as education, health and disaster relief that address local needs and benefit the societies we serve. We are now going further than ever, with the development of a comprehensive sustainability strategy that will extend our reach and impact, and make sure that our work is aligned with the aims of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We continue to engage with all our stakeholders, and we aim to announce our strategy in full later this year. The Board fully supports this work, which is described on pages 53-55: and I know it will also have the support of Airtel Africa colleagues, who already do so much to create opportunity and serve their communities, and who have shown by their actions this year that they are committed to transforming lives across Africa. I thank them for their extraordinary efforts and dedication. Sunil Bharti Mittal Chair 11 May 2021 9 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 Strategic report c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: ChairmansXstatement v32 Modification Date: 25 May 2021 4:47 pm Chief executive officer's review Progress across all our strategic pillars this year has meant that despite the challenging times, we have been able to deliver the 'win-win' scenario: where our provision of essential services to customers and communities has fed our profitable growth, which in turn sustains our ability to keep advancing digitalisation and expanding financial inclusion in underserved markets. Raghunath Mandava Chief executive officer Providing essential services, and delivering on our purpose of transforming lives Strategic report 10 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: CEOsXreview v57 Modification Date: 26 May 2021 8:27 am In this year in which people everywhere have had to find ways to adapt to new circumstances, I'm grateful to everyone at Airtel Africa and to all our stakeholders for helping us ensure that we could continue to provide essential services in all our markets and serve more customers than ever before. We have all lived and worked under the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic for more than a year now. While I am hopeful that there are signs of recovery, the pandemic has had a deep and unprecedented impact on people's lives and livelihoods, on their health, and on whole economies. I am very proud of the work we have done to look after our employees, to help our communities, and to maintain our services at a time when they have never been more critical. I am especially proud of how fast, and how well, our employees adapted, whether working from home or out in the field, to stay safe while staying close to our customers. They knew that at times of lockdown or travel restriction, data and voice services were many people's only means of contact with their families, and their only way to do business. Mobile money services became more important than ever, both as a safe way to do business without cash and contact, and as a lifeline to people separated from loved ones. Throughout the crisis, we kept our networks and services running, and invested in strengthening them further for the future - putting into action our purpose of transforming lives. At the same time we helped with national and local efforts during the pandemic - for example by enabling free access to educational websites for students learning from home, or providing free airtime for health promotion and Covid-19 messages through our partnership with USAID-funded Breakthrough ACTION Nigeria and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control NCDC. Our strong business performance underlines once again that serving and empowering customers and their communities is the only way to success - and our new sustainability ambition, described on pages 50-53, is designed to ensure that we continue to grow responsibly and in ways that create even more social and economic value for our stakeholders. We talk more about our work during Covid-19 on pages 16-17, describing its impact on our business, and the measures and mitigations we put in place to protect our colleagues, support our communities and keep our customers connected. Strategic overview While we have adapted what we do over the last year to make sure we keep serving customers, our underlying business strategy has not changed. If anything, Covid-19 has accelerated the trends that underpin our strategy: a continuous and expanding demand for mobile money and mobile services from growing populations who are underserved by infrastructure, especially those in the remote rural areas of this beautiful continent. Our aim remains to provide a model which provides affordable telecoms services in a profitable and sustainable manner, thus reducing the digital divide and enhancing financial inclusion in the countries we serve. Our work marches alongside social and economic development - especially when, as this year, we increase our capacity and extend the network and distribution to people living far from the nearest fixed-line infrastructure or financial institutions. And it demands both innovation and disciplined execution by our teams, who have once again strengthened our networks and expanded our distribution channels, allowing us to grow our customer base to 118.2 million. Like all good business models, ours relies on a continuous monitoring and mitigation of risk - including, for us, currency volatility and or foreign exchange shortage in some of the economies hit by the pandemic. Our strategy is designed to overcome these risks by delivering faster revenue growth with improved profitability, strengthening our balance sheet by asset monetisation through towerco sales, and bringing fresh investment into our mobile money business. The key risks to our business and the risk mitigation we have planned are further described in pages 72-78. While we detail our 'Win with' strategy on pages 24-31, I would like to say a few words on its key strategic elements. Win with network Our strategy to continuously build on our network in rural areas and improve network quality and capacity in urban areas helped serve customers better, when customers were far more dependent on our networks than ever before. In spite of all the restrictions of movement and the risks of Covid-19, our teams have achieved our highest ever network availability. We have added more than 2,400 sites, taking our total sites to 25,368. Because of the single RAN technology we use, we now have 94% of our sites on 3G and 76.5% of sites on 4G technology. Our continuous expansion of fibre to over 54,500km has helped us significantly expand our data capacities in line with our plan to create huge data capacities at marginal costs. Win with customers We have continued to expand our distribution infrastructure through a mix of multi-brand outlets, supported by our own exclusive franchiserun shops and kiosks. Maintaining the momentum of last year, we have almost doubled our exclusive large-format retail footprint across our markets, thereby bringing our services much closer to our customers. Our total exclusive Airtel Money branches and kiosks have grown to over 10,000 and 37,800 respectively. This has enabled greater accessibility for new customers to sign up, better recharge availability and easier access to mobile money during a year when our customers' movement was often restricted. This supported a customer base growth of 6.9% and voice revenue growth of 11.0%. Customer base growth was affected, however, by new customer registration regulations for telecoms operators in Nigeria, introduced in December 2020 and described on page 20 of this report. Airtel Nigeria is working with the Nigerian government to ensure that all our subscribers provide their valid National Identification Numbers NINs to update the existing SIM registration records. The deadline for existing base has been extended to 30 June 2021. We resumed new customer acquisition in approved outlets in the second half of April 2021 see page 21 for further details. Win with data This pandemic year has underlined customers' need for mobile data as the pace of digitalisation has quickened. In addition to the mobile data services that we offer, we also increased our focus on our wireless home broadband products to help people working and studying from home through a mix of WiFi routers and pocket WiFi devices. We continued our focus on further expanding our fibre footprint to provide better connectivity to our enterprise customers. All these initiatives serve our vision of bridging the data divide. Simplified pricing and reduction of 'pay-as-you-go' PAYG rates has further helped in data adoption, with data customers growing by 14.5%, which along with data usage per customer growing by 44.2% has led to data revenue growth of 31.2%. Data usage per customer for the quarter ended March 2021 stands at 2.8 GB per month. 11 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 Strategic report c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: CEOsXreview v57 Modification Date: 26 May 2021 8:27 am Chief executive officer's review continued Win with mobile money We continue to drive the growth of digital financial services on the continent, thereby serving the wider purpose of extending financial inclusion to people who have been left untouched by traditional banking. We have a clear strategy to continue to drive sustainable long-term growth in Airtel Money with a focus on assured float availability, distribution reach and increased use cases for our customers. Higher float availability in the farthest corners of our markets is helping more individuals, small traders and businesses to adopt mobile money for their daily business needs. Our mobile money customer base grew by 18.5%. The increase in contributions from merchant payments, cash transactions, P2P transfers and mobile services recharges through Airtel Money have helped grow our mobile money transaction value even faster at 53.6%, enabling mobile money revenues to grow by 35.5%. Win with cost The pandemic placed heavy pressures on the business in terms of costs. There have been greater costs for enhancing the safety of our people, and we incurred costs as movement restrictions were imposed. Further, huge increases in demand for our services increased our costs of running towers, due to increased fuel and loading charges. However, tight monitoring and our efficiency drive, along with redesigning and eliminating some of our operational activities while adapting to new ways of working helped to keep cost increases lower than revenue growth. Greater recharging through mobile money and other digital means have helped reduce our costs further. Our incremental capacities were brought in at marginal costs and this helped keep our EBITDA flow-through on incremental revenue at 59.4%. Win with people Our people have been the strongest pillar for us. Our leaders and managers and our HR teams across the business have shown great empathy and understanding in helping people cope as our employees rose to the occasion to serve our customers. My special thanks go to all those in the field, especially the sales and network colleagues who made sure our services were up and available for customers even in remote or inaccessible markets. Even as we went through these difficult times, our learning and development teams have embarked on training all leaders in objective selection and performance management methodologies. Our empowered OpCo management teams, led by local managing directors and supported by regional directors, have helped the organisation be agile and responsive to the changes on the ground. T ransforming lives Progress across all our strategic pillars this year has meant that despite the challenging times, we have been able to deliver the 'win-win' scenario: where our provision of essential services to customers and communities has fed our profitable growth, which in turn sustains our ability to keep advancing digitalisation and expanding financial inclusion in underserved markets. It is a virtuous circle that our strategy is designed to maintain and it is a clear expression of our purpose of transforming lives. This would not be possible without the hard work of our employees and the support of our stakeholders. I would like to thank them for their efforts and their continued dedication to our shared purpose. In conclusion, I am thankful to Airtel Africa for providing me and my team the opportunity to transform the business and fulfil our responsibility to the countries in which we operate. It has been a privilege to serve in the African continent and I cherish my time here. Airtel Africa is a remarkable business with fantastic people. Having been at Bharti Airtel for 13 years and at Airtel Africa for 5 years as chief executive officer, I feel now is the right time to take a sabbatical. The last five years have been an exhilarating journey where we have been able to turn around and transform the business into a strong high growth and profitable company. We have been able to build the business with our unique management and problem solving approach to bring in substantial performance improvement. I am very proud of what we have achieved over the past five years in Africa, and I look forward to seeing the Company make even greater progress over the coming years. Raghunath Mandava Chief executive officer 11 May 2021 Harnessing the power of mobile phones to protect people's health Covid-19 touched the lives of people and communities across our markets - and one way we'five responded is through publicprivate partnerships that help protect our customers' health. In Nigeria, for example, we gave people the opportunity to access key Covid-19 messages in five languages on their phones through our partnership with USAID-funded Breakthrough ACTION Nigeria and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control NCDC. We provided free infrastructure and airtime so people could get critical and reliable information on Covid-19, placing calls to 15 million subscribers and sending out 32 million text messages. Nearly 190,000 people called the 3-2-1 service to receive information about Covid-19.

Increase in voice traffic was driven by our customer base growth of 6.9%, and an increase of usage per customer of 16.4% to 234 minutes per customer per month. Our voice usage growth was mainly driven by our expansion of rural network coverage, our investment in rural sales and distribution infrastructure, and by customer adoption of our 'more-for-more' voice bundles. Our KPIs give our Board and management a clear sense of where we're making progress, and where we need to improve.

This reflects our continuous focus on investment in sales and distribution infrastructure in urban and rural markets, including our exclusive distribution channel of kiosks and Airtel Money branches. Our enhanced distribution channel ensures availability of SIM cards, recharge cards and money float. Our customer base grew across all three regions: in Nigeria by 0.5%, in East Africa by 9.2%, and in Francophone Africa by 14.5%. The voice revenue growth was driven by an increase in our customer base of 6.9%, voice usage per customer growth of 16.4%, partially offset by rate drop of 14%, largely due to a decrease in roaming revenue during Covid-19 and interconnect usage charges in a few of the East Africa and Francophone Africa markets. Measuring the success of our strategy We monitor the success of our strategy through financial and operational key performance indicators KPIs. Our operational KPIs reflect the measurement of our key strategic pillars: growing our customer base, strengthening our network, growing voice, data, and mobile money revenue streams, and improving cost efficiency. Our financial KPIs monitor our progress in terms of our profitability ambitions. As well as helping measure and monitor our progress, our KPIs help us communicate the Group's strategy across all levels of the organisation, and form part of our governance and performance management process. Ensuring our KPIs are meaningful and responsive To reflect our strategic pillars, our primary operational KPIs include sites, data capacity, customer base, net additions, churn, average revenue per user ARPU, usage per customer, Airtel Money transactions, and transaction value per customer. Our key financial KPIs are revenue, underlying EBITDA, operating profit, profit after tax, operating free cash flow, free cash flow, net debt, leverage, earnings per share, and return on capital employed. We also focus on aspects of our business not currently covered by a KPI, including our environmental and social performance, and on our workplaces. They will form part of our sustainability strategy, for which we will announce targets and commitments in Q3 2022 see pages 50-53 for more details about our sustainability ambition. We review our operational and financial KPIs regularly to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy and organisational goals. See definition and reconciliation of our alternative performance measures on pages 67-71 Linkage with remuneration Our remuneration targets are linked with our financial KPIs revenue, underlying EBITDA and operational free cash flow. As part of our long-term incentive scheme, we also benchmark our total shareholder return performance with a peer group of companies.

This growth was largely driven by our expansion of our agents and merchant ecosystems, the increase in Airtel Money's product portfolio through strategic partnerships, and continued investment in our exclusive franchise channel of kiosks and branches. Data ARPU growth was supported by an increase in the number of 4G customers, who have higher usage and ARPU than 3G data customers. The marginal decline in the rate of data revenue growth compared to last year was in part due to reduced imports of handsets across our footprint during the Covid-19 pandemic. 15 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 Strategic report c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: KPIs v64 Modification Date: 26 May 2021 8:13 am Covid-19 Serving our customers, safeguarding our people, minimising risk The Covid-19 pandemic has contributed to a rapid acceleration of already existing macro trends across the countries where we operate, with people, businesses and governments seeking access to more and better connectivity and improved financial inclusion. These challenging times have shown that the telecoms industry is a key and essential service for these economies, allowing customers to work remotely, reduce their travel, stay connected and have access to affordable entertainment and financial services. Covid-19 presented significant challenges to the business, particularly during the initial phase of the pandemic when mobile money and services growth slowed. However, the actions taken by the Board in the first quarter ensured the continued execution of our strategy, including meeting increased customer demand for data, mobile money and mobile services. We say a huge thank you to all our people, who even during lockdowns and in times of national crisis managed to keep our distribution channels available and our networks fully operational despite increased demand. We also pay tribute to our business partners, who continued to deliver their services despite numerous logistical challenges, and to the governments and regulators who continued to support the industry and helped facilitate our continued support to the economies of these countries and the communities we serve. Monitoring the Covid-19 context in our markets At the beginning of the pandemic, which coincided with the start of our financial year, most governments in the countries where we operate acted swiftly to implement and enforce restrictions on the movement of people to prevent contagion. These swift actions, along with low population density, less frequent travel, and local experience in dealing with contagious diseases, resulted in low infection rates in sub-Saharan Africa relative to some other regions. In the months that followed, some restrictions have generally been eased and local economies have improved, although many consumers still feel cautious about social and working habits. The pandemic continues to pose a threat to communities, however, and towards the end of our financial year we saw further waves in some regions. While this has had no adverse impact on our business, we will continue to monitor the situation closely. Around the world the vaccination effort has started, with many governments hinting at a possible significant easing of social distancing rules and travel restrictions this year, though it looks like Africa may lag behind other economies in attaining full vaccination cover. Despite the resilience demonstrated by our business during the year, we are constantly monitoring how the situation is evolving to identify key risks and put in place adequate mitigation plans to minimise any potential disruptions. Ensuring our employees are safe, our networks are serving customers, and our finances are sustainable The Group will continue to focus on ensuring the safety of our employees, our outsourced partners and our customers: ensuring that our network and distribution channels remain fully operational and available: ensuring that our customers continue to have access to financial services: and ensuring that at Group level we have the right financial position to meet our financial obligations at all times. Safety for our employees The Covid-19 crisis has led to profound changes in operating environments across our markets, and throughout the last year we continued to reinforce health and safety measures for all our employees, for outsourced partners and for our customers as a key priority. All our offices continue to offer the option of remote working, or working in shifts and with social distancing practices, depending upon the critical needs of individual functions. Our OpCos still have a large percentage of employees working from home with increased digital access to enable a seamless workflow. All employees continue to be on full pay and, along with their family members, continue to receive full medical insurance cover, which includes any diagnostic testing, associated physician visits related to Covid-19 and vaccination costs. We have also granted immediate paid medical leave for any employees diagnosed with Covid-19. More recently we launched an employee assistance programme, which allows our employees access to free consultations with mental healthcare professionals. The aim of this programme is to help employees achieve mental wellbeing by ensuring harmony between work and personal life and by providing access to support when employees need to speak to someone. Safety for our outsourced teams The outsourced staff in our call centres have all been given the option and equipment to either work from home with strict data security protocols, or, if necessary, from the office following strict social distancing practices and regulatory guidelines. Protective equipment and hand sanitisers have also been made available within our shops to keep both our staff and customers safe. Safety for our customers We have delivered a range of educational digital campaigns explaining best practices during the Covid-19 outbreak, and the importance of being safe. We have significantly enhanced our self-care mobile app by adding features to enable customers to self-service, removing the need for a visit to a shop or an agent. We have partnered with other ogranisations and made a number of online educational platforms accessible free of charge to give students continuous access to quality education. Our staff across all our OpCos have also generously contributed and sacrificed from their salaries a total of $362,000, which we have matched like-for-like as a company and donated to the respective governments to support the communities where we operate. Resilience for our network For many of our customers our network remains the main source for their social interactions, their work and entertainment. The key business continuity plans we implemented at the start of the pandemic ensured that both active and passive maintenance services could be safely carried out even when the movement of people was restricted. During an increase in data traffic of more than 74%, and voice traffic of more than 29%, our network did not experience any significant disruption. Strengthening distribution Ensuring customers retain access to our services remains a key priority for us. When lockdown restrictions were implemented, we increased stock levels of SIM cards and recharge vouchers to ensure continued availability in our shops and enable customers to buy recharges whenever convenient. We have also encouraged customers to use digital methods of recharge, including through Unstructured Supplementary Service Data USSD, bank portals or our app. Strategic report 16 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: Covid 19 v52 Modification Date: 26 May 2021 8:14 am In April 2020 we launched the new MyAirtel self-care app in all 14 countries. Using the app, a customer can check airtime or bundles and purchase them using Airtel Money or any credit or debit cards. It also has various Airtel Money features so that customers can send money to Airtel and other operators, pay bills, pay merchants, scan and pay using Airtel's or Mastercard's QR codes and virtual cards, and use Airtel Money and e-recharge to minimise the impact of any possible disruption to our distribution network. We have pushed the e-recharge scheme even further by allowing customers to e-recharge both friends' and loved ones' accounts, for which they also receive benefits in return. As lockdown restrictions have eased we have been able to expand our distribution, in line with our strategy, and we continued to carry higher stock levels to mitigate the risks that possible future restrictions on the movement of people could have on our stock levels and the ability of customers to access our recharge vouchers. Maintaining mobile money growth During the initial phase of the pandemic, mobile money revenue growth slowed to 26.3% as the business was impacted by social distancing measures and non-essential service closures, reducing customers' ability to deposit and withdraw cash. Additionally, several governments asked mobile money operators to waive fees on certain transactions, including person-to-person and merchant payments. Afterwards, as lockdown restrictions were generally eased and most fees on transactions reinstated, revenue growth for the full year rebounded to 35.5%, reaching 38.7% in Q4, with mobile money contributing over 10.6% of the Group revenue in the quarter. Improving our financial position Our financial position continued to improve during the year. Free cash flow increased 42.8% during the financial year and underlying EBITDA margin continued to improve by 210 bps to 46.1%. Our net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio improved to 2.0x, despite investing $247m of intangible capex to renew licences in two of our biggest markets, Nigeria and Uganda, and acquiring additional spectrum across several markets. Our cash balances, in conjunction with more than $1.1bn of committed undrawn facilities, ensure we can continue to meet our financial obligations. We have $2.4bn in longterm bonds with the first repayment of $879m EU750m due in May 2021 which will be paid through a mix of cash held as well as from the proceeds of a $500m inaugural multi-bank long-term facility part of the $1.1bn undrawn facilities mentioned above entered into by Airtel Africa plc in April 2021. Post this repayment, only $1.5bn of long-term bonds will remain outstanding for the Group, with the next major bond repayment of $505m not due until March 2023. In recent months we have announced several transactions to strengthen our balance sheet, including asset monetisation through towerco sales, and bringing fresh investment into our mobile money business amounting in aggregate to c. $400m, with proceeds expected to be received in the next 12-18 months, which will further improve our financial position and continue our deleveraging. Additionally, we have agreed longer payment terms of up to around 12 months with strategic vendors in certain markets to facilitate continued investment in modernising the network, while also increasing liquidity. We have continued to invest in our network with tangible capex spend for the year of $614m. This was slightly below our committed spend of between $650m to $700m, due largely to the delays of import logistics and on-field deployment challenges during the pandemic. Our capex guidance for the next financial year remains in the range of $650m to $700m as we continue to invest in our network and distribution. We have identified several ways to retain cash, reduce costs and mitigate risks from Covid-19. In addition, we have continued to invest in revenue-driving expenditures, while reducing discretionary spend. See page 154 for our going concern assessment Monitoring foreign exchange risk The global economic slowdown, combined with lower oil and commodity prices, has resulted in currencies devaluing across our markets, including the Nigerian naira, Kenyan shilling and Zambian kwacha. By far our largest exposure is in Nigeria, which represents 40% of our revenue and 47% of underlying EBITDA. On a 12-month basis, we estimate that a 1% Nigerian naira devaluation will have a negative $14m impact on revenue, $8m on underlying EBITDA and $6m on finance costs. See page 79 for our long-term viability statement Reaching out to send relief payments through mobile money The potential for mobile money as a way to transmit payments safely and transparently has been harnessed by a wide range of organisations, including governments, UN agencies and NGOs. This has been particularly true during Covid-19, when Airtel Money has helped partners such as governments, ministries, Plan international, Childfund, and UNICEF deliver Covid-19 relief payment packages to beneficiaries who can then access them securely and conveniently through their phones. Our current partnerships will reach more than 200,000 beneficiaries in total.

We aim to abide by all laws and regulatory frameworks, and we support governments and regulatory agencies to drive digital and financial inclusion. Strategic report 20 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name:  v21 Modification Date: 25 May 2021 5:06 pm While legal and regulatory frameworks are unique to each country, they can be broadly classified in three categories: telecoms services, mobile financial services and broadcasting services. National competition law and laws developed by economic blocks also apply in some of our markets. Our regulatory environment constantly evolves, and we keep it under continuous review. We publish significant developments on our corporate website, under 'Regulatory news'. This year, significant developments in our largest markets included: Licence renewal in Nigeria In January 2021, Airtel Networks Limited Airtel Nigeria, announced that its application for renewal of the spectrum licences in the 900MHz and 1800MHz bands had been approved by the Nigerian Communications Commission NCC. Pursuant to Section 43 of the Nigerian Communications Act, 2003 and Condition 20 of the Unified Access Service Licence UASL, Airtel Nigeria applied to renew the UASL operations licence and spectrum licences in the 900MHz and 1800MHz bands which would otherwise expire on 30 November 2021. Following the application, the NCC offered Airtel Nigeria the opportunity to renew its spectrum licences in the 900MHz and 1800MHz bands for a period of ten years, with effect from 1 December 2021 until 30 November 2031, which Airtel Nigeria accepted. Under the terms of the spectrum licences Airtel Nigeria paid N71.611bn $182m in respect of the licence renewal fees. The UASL is still under consideration by the NCC and formal confirmation of renewal is expected before the expiry date of 30 November 2021. New licence in Uganda In December 2020, Airtel Uganda Limited Airtel Uganda was issued with a National Telecom Operator NTO Licence following a period of negotiation and transition to a new licensing regime. The new licence is with effect from 1 July 2020 and is for a period of 20 years, until 30 June 2040. Airtel Uganda will retain all its current spectrum, subject to the law and terms of assignment. The scope of services is the provision of basic telecommunication services, infrastructure services, and value-added telecommunication services. In addition, Airtel Uganda commits to achieving coverage of 90% of the geographical boundary of Uganda within five years of the effective date of the licence, with a minimum obligation of providing voice and data services. Under the terms of the licence, Airtel Uganda has paid $74.6m for the first ten years of the licence, which includes VAT of $11.4m. After the first 10 years, Airtel will be invoiced for the licence fee for the remaining 10 years. Under Article 16 of the NTO, Airtel Uganda is obliged to comply with the sector policy, regulations and guidelines requiring the listing of part of its shares on the Uganda Stock Exchange. The current Uganda Communications Fees and Fines Amendment Regulations 2020 create a public listing obligation for all NTO licensees and specifies that 20% be listed within two years of the effective date of the licence. New shareholding requirements in Kenya On 9 April 2021, the Ministry for Information, Communications and Technology ICT published an amendment to the National ICT Policy Guidelines, 2020 ICT Policy. The amendment will have an impact on Airtel's business in Kenya in the following ways: Airtel Networks Kenya Limited, which currently holds an indefinite exemption from the Ministry for ICT, dated 20 March 2013, has three years, with effect from 9 April 2021, to comply with the requirement to have 30% local shareholding Airtel Money Kenya Limited, which holds a Content Service Provider Licence from the Communications Authority of Kenya, with effect from November 2020, has three years from the date of the licence to comply with the requirement to have 30% local shareholding. Under the amended ICT policy, a licensee may apply to the Ministry for ICT for an extension to comply with the requirement, or obtain an exemption. KYC requirements in Nigeria Following a directive issued by the Nigerian Communications Commission NCC on 15 December 2020 to all Nigerian telecom operators, Airtel Nigeria has been working with the government to ensure that all our subscribers provide their valid National Identification Numbers NINs to update SIM registration records. Initially, new customer acquisitions were barred until significant progress had been made on linking the active customer base with verified NINs. Natural churn in the customer base led to a loss of 2.5 million active mobile customers in the final quarter of the year. The financial impact has been minimal, however, with continued revenue growth in Nigeria, due largely to the significantly lower ARPU of the churned base and increased usage by the active customer base. In April 2021, the NCC announced that it would allow new customer enrolment from certified outlets. Airtel Nigeria has so far received interim approvals for around 800 outlets, and new customer registrations have begun in those outlets. The directive set an initial deadline for customers to register their NIN with their SIM of 30 December 2020. This was subsequently moved several times with the latest deadline set for 30 June 2021. We have made significant progress on capturing existing NINs and building the database in collaboration with the National Identity Management Commission NIMC. To date, out of Airtel Nigeria's 42.0 million active customers, we have collated NIN information for 23.2 million active mobile customers. To complete the registration process, we must also verify the NIN information we have received from our subscribers with the NIMC. For the still significant proportion of the population, and of our customers, that do not have a NIN, we have opened enrolment centres in collaboration with the NIMC. We are in the process of rolling out thousands of devices to further NIN enrolment. We continue to work closely with the government to ensure full compliance. 21 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 Strategic report c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name:  v21 Modification Date: 25 May 2021 5:06 pm Our business model Our dynamic business model delivers value to stakeholders while transforming lives through digitalisation and financial inclusion.

Our products and services are helping transform lives across sub-Saharan Africa by fostering financial inclusion, driving digitalisation and empowering our 118.2 million customers. T o continue to serve our vision of enriching the lives of our customers, we have a clear business objective: to grow market share profitably and create superior enterprise value. Our 'Win with' strategy describes the six strategic pillars in which we focus our work to achieve our business objectives. Cutting across all these pillars is our commitment to transforming lives, driving sustainable development and acting as a responsible business - work that is helping us develop our new sustainability ambition, described on pages 50-53. Working to enhance digitalisation and financial inclusion with the governments and institutions of the countries in which we operate is a central element of our strategy. We aim to help them realise their goals for sustainable development by working to integrate mobile services and mobile money usage into their economies. At the same time, we know that strict and continued compliance with local laws and regulations and listing requirements are a vital element in our current and future success. We aim to act as a responsible business at all times. That means doing business transparently and with a sound governance structure. It also means being a good partner and an active contributor to society, by creating jobs, paying taxes and respecting the environment. We also support our communities by working with local stakeholders in our core sustainability programmes: improving digital education, improving health and supporting communities through disaster relief. Strategic report 24 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: OurXstrategy v71 Modification Date: 25 May 2021 5:09 pm Our strategic intent We aim to create a leading, modernised network that can provide the data capacity to meet rapidly growing demand and enhance connectivity and digitalisation in our markets. That means improving basic network uptime and quality as well as expanding our network footprint and our 3G and 4G capabilities. Focusing on rural coverage expansion through new site rollouts, recognising that access to a reliable service is the critical first step for providing previously underserved communities with the opportunity for digital and financial inclusion Focusing on our network resilience and service continuity Building and modernising our network through optimal end-to-end design, including spectrum additions, carrier aggregation, the use of single RAN technology and fibre rollout Expanding 4G coverage and building capacity Delivering voice quality index while improving network uptime Our progress in 2020 21 We continue to see delivering the best 4G network in our markets as a key focus, and our goal is to be the market leader everywhere we operate. This year we had an additional focus on resilience and continuity of service - because we realised how much our customers and their businesses depended on us as Covid-19 restrictions curtailed movement and trade. Increases in sites, coverage, and data capacity all reflect this priority, and came despite the complexities imposed by the pandemic. Our increase in data capacity was driven in part by the addition of further fibre connections to our network. This has meant customers can achieve greater international connectivity, as well as benefiting from fibre connections within and between many cities and urban areas. Similarly, our investment in new and existing sites has enabled us to increase data speeds as well as coverage. How we measure progress We measure network through a number of KPIs, described on page 14, including: Total sites and data capacity: we deployed more than 2,400 additional sites, reaching 25,368 sites in total as of 31 March 2021. During the year, we added 3,400 more sites to 3G 94% of sites on 3G, 4,500 more sites to 4G 76.5% of sites now on 4G and added an incremental 11,500km of fibre 54,500 km of fibre as of 31 March 2021. Data capacity increased by 59.4% to 12,000 terabytes TB per day, with peak hour data utilisation at 45%.

In the DRC, for example, our consistent investment in our tower and fibre network has made us the leading 4G provider in the country, with 4G coverage for 38% of the population. With 3,500 km of fibre network and 76.8% of our sites on 4G, we are able to connect millions of people across the DRC to each other, to communities across Africa, and to the global economy. We are market leaders in data, and supply internet bandwidth to a number of other critical service providers, including government agencies, public health bodies, multinationals, and UN agencies. And this year alone we deployed nine Packet Core sites data switching centres in addition to the existing three sites for disaster recovery and redundancy, making our network even more resilient.

This helps us to onboard more customers - and it also helps us serve them better and in more ways, enabling recharges and access to mobile money services. We'five also continued to focus on fast, effective digital onboarding, bringing new customers to our service in ways that are compliant with local Know Your Customer KYC requirements while being as efficient as possible - and which this year also met local requirements for Covid-19 safety when many retail outlets were closed. In Rwanda, Malawi, Gabon and Zambia, we worked with regulators to achieve temporary permissions to carry out the biometric elements of KYC digitally. In Nigeria, we are working as partners with the government to deliver its national identity number NIN programme, which makes collecting NINs a requirement for new and existing customers, including by operating NIN enrolment centres. Across every market, we have now developed an app for digital registration, and most onboarding processes are achieved in five minutes or less. How we measure progress We measure customers through a number of KPIs, described on page 14, including: Customer base and net adds: Our overall customer base grew 6.9% to 118.2 million as of 31 March 2021, a rate of growth that was subdued by the sector-wide regulations barring new customer acquisitions in Nigeria from mid December 2020 - and excluding Nigeria, our customer base growth was 10.7% see our KPI on page 15. The overall growth reflects our continuous focus on investment in sales and distribution infrastructure in urban and rural markets, including our exclusive Airtel Money distribution channel of kiosks and branches. Our enhanced distribution channel ensures availability of SIM cards, recharge cards and mobile money float. Our voice revenue grew by 11.0%. See our principal risks on pages 74-77 See our business model on page 22 See our sustainability ambition on pages 50-53 Win with customers Getting closer to more customers in Malawi Expanding our distribution network so we can get closer to more customers is central to our strategy, giving us the platform to include millions more people in the digital economy, and driving our own sustainable growth. In Malawi this year, we grew our customer base by 31.3% through a rapid expansion of our distribution network and a clear focus on customer needs, including fast onboarding processes and a simple and competitive product offering. At the heart of our expansion were our Airtel Money branches, kiosks, outlets and agents: we increased our Airtel Money branches in the country by 84% in a single year, and more than doubled the number of outlets where customers could register and complete local Know Your Customer requirements. Our focus on speed meant that more than 90% of new customers were onboarded in less than five minutes. Across Malawi, our expansion meant that more people than ever could access financial services through Airtel Money, which grew its customer base by 63%.

That means encouraging smartphone ownership and increasing data usage at scale, while increasing access to the digital economy for customers in our markets. Our approach includes: Leveraging our 4G network for data ARPU and revenue growth Smartphone offerings through partnerships with device OEMs 'Original Equipment Manufacturers' and device selling outlets Building our wireless home broadband business Developing innovative products and data solutions for corporate and SME customers through Airtel Business As part of our expansion of data services, we have an important responsibility to keep customers' data secure. Building and reinforcing our data security systems will be a key focus of our sustainability strategy. Our progress in 2020 21 All our strategic pillars are closely interconnected, and our success in achieving our ambitions for data are closely linked to our ability to extend and maintain fast, reliable networks, and to being close to our customers. Being the leading 4G provider gives us a competitive advantage when it comes to new customer acquisitions, while our ability to provide capacity helps drive usage. The strong presence of our outlets and our marketing investment support this network advantage. As our KPIs show, our customer base and data usage both grew in 2020 21. We also monitor 4G net additions, which track the number of new devices coming into our 4G network - 36.4% of our data customer base has 4G devices. Another focus for 2020 21 was our launch of new broadband and wireless home network solutions, which helped people required to work from home as well as leisure users. How we measure progress We measure data through a number of KPIs, described on page 14, including: Data customers, 4G data customers and penetration: Our data customer base increased by 14.5% to 40.6 million as of 31 March 2021, and now constitutes 34.3% of our total customer base. Our total data usage increased by 74.8% in 2020 21 to 1,242 billion MB. Data usage per customer per month reached 2.6 GB, an increase of 44.2%. Data usage rises with the mobile technology used, with 4G data usage delivering the highest data usage levels, at 5 GB. 4G data usage more than doubled and contributed 62.2% to total data usage as of Q4. See our principal risks on pages 74-77 See our business model on page 22 See our sustainability ambition on pages 50-53 Win with data 36.2% increase in data revenue year on year Meeting customers' demand for data in Nigeria There is demand for data everywhere in our markets, from remote rural areas to towns and cities across the continent. Our strategy revolves around reaching more people with data services by expanding our 4G network, and increasing the speed and capacity we can provide in areas we already cover, including through home broadband offers. Nigeria shows this strategy in action. This year we built L2600 technology into 2,900 additional sites, introduced home broadband packages in more than 150 towns just when customers who were working or studying at home needed it most, and used sales teams and retail outlets to promote WiFi technology. We focused on price bundles that met customers' needs, and leveraged a network that now covers more than 78.8% of the population, with 84% of our sites now offering 4G. The result was that more Nigerians than ever before had access to the opportunities provided by our data services, while the overall data traffic we enabled grew by 74.2% year on year.

Isack Nchunda Airtel Money Director, Tanzania Our strategic intent We aim to accelerate the digital ecosystem by rapidly enabling Airtel Money services in all our markets, harnessing the potential of a profitable mobile money business to enhance financial inclusion in some of the most 'unbanked' populations in the world. We will achieve this by: Efficiently operating the largest branch network comprising kiosks, mini shops and dedicated Airtel Money branches, so customers can access assured float and cash Making Airtel Money the currency of choice by building on strategic partnerships to expand local and global acceptance and deepening in-store and e-commerce usage Expanding our mobile money ecosystem through international money transfer services, merchant and commercial payments, benefit transfers, loans, savings and insurance Pro-actively cross-selling Airtel Money to our mobile services base Focusing on technology as an enabler and competitive advantage Our progress in 2020 21 We maintained a consistent focus on the execution of our mobile money strategy, continuing the key trends from previous years by focusing on our distribution network, our cash float availability, and our drive to increase Airtel Money's acceptance as the currency of choice across the financial ecosystem. As the KPIs show, these measures have widened our customer base and driven increased revenues. Our reach has also been increased by our use of technology as a key enabler for competitive advantage. We know that this aspect of mobile money never stops evolving, and we have invested in our application programming interfaces APIs, which enable us to form partnerships that create new ways to use Airtel Money, for example by expanding our virtual card partnership with Mastercard to Tanzania and Uganda. In December 2020, Airtel Uganda, together with our long-term technology partner Comviva, won three awards at the Emerging Payments Awards for our payments and merchant solutions, supplementing previous awards for our Airtel Wallet collaboration. How we measure progress We measure mobile money progress through a number of KPIs, described on page 14, including: Airtel Money customer base and penetration: our Airtel Money customer base grew by 18.5% to 21.7 million in 2020 21. Airtel Money transaction value and transaction value per customer: our transaction value grew by 53.6% to $46bn in 2020 21. Transaction value per customer grew by 20.9% in constant currency. Airtel Money revenue and ARPU: Airtel Money revenue grew by 35.5% in 2020 21. Airtel Money ARPU was $1.7, up by 6.6% in constant currency. See our principal risks on pages 74-77 See our business model on page 22 See our sustainability ambition on pages 50-53 Win with mobile money Extending our reach and changing the game in Tanzania Accessibility is at the heart of our mobile money strategy - we need to be close to customers, and we need to assure them that when they come to our outlets, we'll have the cash float to meet their needs. We'five had a relentless focus on this aspect of our execution this year - and our performance in Tanzania is a great example of the result. Until recently, we were not a significant player in Tanzania's mobile money sector - but this year, our mobile money revenues grew by 54.7%, and our customer base grew by 19% to more than 4.5 million. The turnaround was driven in large part by better distribution - we rolled out more than 550 Airtel Money branches and more than 39,000 Airtel agents in the year - supported by effective pricing and the new products and partnerships that are helping us grow the Airtel Money ecosystem everywhere. And we focused on making sure that when customers came to us, we could meet their needs - driving significant increases in our agents' float balances. The result is a huge improvement in our performance, as well as the creation of around 120,000 income opportunities, and more financial inclusion in a country where only 21% of the population over 14 years of age has a bank account.

As a result of our partnership, organisations in Uganda had full-feature access to Avaya Spaces, a cloud meeting and team collaboration solution that means colleagues can chat, voice, video, have online meetings and share content, enabling them to continue working effectively. See our sustainability ambition on pages 50-53 Transforming lives spotlight Going the last mile in Zambia Airtel Zambia formed a partnership in February 2021 with the United Nations Capital Development Fund UNCDF to roll out a 'Last Mile Distribution' project designed to extend Airtel Money services to rural areas. The partnership aims to build a cashless economy and support the government's efforts to control Covid-19 while strengthening the digital financial services sector. \" This project capitalises on the investment we have made in the country over the years by building necessary infrastructure, expanding digital finance and providing the necessary support to achieving financial inclusion\". James Chona, Airtel Money Director, Zambia Transforming lives spotlight Digitalising essential services in Rwanda Our Airtel Money platforms are helping to create whole new ecosystems that support the delivery of government services as well as commerce. In Rwanda, for example, Airtel Africa is playing a key role in supporting the government's e-services as part of the country's digital-first approach. Airtel Money is plugged into the e-government facility, and Rwandans can use Airtel Money to pay for a wide range of services including marriage certificates, birth certificates and health insurance, which are then delivered by SMS.

Transforming lives spotlight 29 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 Strategic report c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: OurXstrategy v71 Modification Date: 25 May 2021 5:09 pm Our strategy continued Our strategic intent We aim to achieve an efficient operational model, leading to an effective cost structure and improved margins. This enables us to build large incremental capacity at low marginal cost. We will achieve this through: Our cost efficiency initiatives, which seek to optimise site operational and maintenance expenses, and bandwidth cost A detailed analysis of expenses with the aim of improving operating margins in individual markets Optimal design for vendor service delivery Increasing availability of digital recharges and self-care services Our progress in 2020 21 While operating during the Covid-19 pandemic created some new costs, including our expenditure on employee safety, the sharp rise in demand in 2020 21 demonstrated the resilience of our cost model, which is focused on ensuring that we can provide substantial additional capacity at marginal additional cost, as the KPI indicates. This model applies to our fibre networks, which have significant surplus capacity which can be utilised at nominal cost, as well as to our sites, where much of our continuing work is focused on designing optimal networks, including through the use of improved technology such as optimised antenna sizes. This year, for example, we began working with antenna designers to increase our use of single multi-port antennae in sites where previously several antennae would be needed, increasing our capacity while limiting costs and staying within mandatory tower load requirements. We also continue to invest in energy-efficient radio equipment. How we measure progress We measure cost optimisation through a KPI, described on page 14: Underlying EBITDA for 2020 21 was $1,792m, up by 25.2% versus 2019 20 in constant currency. Underlying EBITDA flowthrough of 59.4%, as a result of better controls on operating cost. Underlying EBITDA margin improved to 46.1%, an improvement of 210 basis points in constant currency. See our principal risks on pages 74-77 See our business model on page 22 Win with cost Joined up thinking: more capacity, at lower marginal cost One of our strategic aims is to leverage the benefits we enjoy through two related advantages: the strength of our fibre network, and the fact that many our markets are contiguous, forming a continuous land corridor across sub-Saharan Africa. It means we can increase capacity at marginal cost - which is at the heart of our strategic intent for cost. In the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC, for example, our substantial investment in 3,500 km of optical fibre, described above, demonstrated its value in 2020 21. Because it connects with our networks in adjacent markets, we are able to transmit up to 20 GBPS to Kenya from the DRC via Rwanda and Uganda. That means we can keep the people and economies of the continent connected, while avoiding the costs of paying a third party for transfers. And because we have ensured our fibre networks have ample capacity, we'll be able to meet future demand with only a small incremental increase in operating expenses.

We will achieve this by: Accelerating a diverse pipeline of talent to meet current and future business needs Building a dedicated people structure for Airtel Money, with appropriate systems and processes Improving coaching and functional skills through our digital learning platform, functional programmes and cognitive assessments Digitalising our people processes to improve overall employee experience. Refreshing our policies and workplace facilities to enable a more diverse and inclusive workplace Our progress in 2020 21 Our focus over the year continued to be on three key areas: talent, capability and technology. We onboarded top talent and reduced our time-to-hire for key roles, made significant progress on the Airtel Money people structures and scaled up the Group's digital capability through Airtel Africa Digital Labs. As a result of our internal development programmes, 31% of promotions into senior management ExCo roles are internal. Through a combination of our digital learning platforms and in-person training, we enriched our functional expertise and on-the-ground coaching. This further enhanced productivity and performance. Keeping our people connected and engaged remains a priority for us. We did this by conducting quarterly Group town halls, including an upward feedback session through Q&A, and through our annual strategic and award conclave in which our people had an opportunity to interact with the chair, Group CEO and Group CFO. Our employee engagement survey continues to provide us with regular insight and feedback from our people. Details of our engagement and programmes, including our employee assistance programme, can be found on page 32 in the stakeholders section. How we measure progress We measure our progress on people through a number of KPIs, including: Diversity: by gender 26% women in our workforce, 23% women in ExCo at the OpCo level and nationality employees from 34 nationalities. Skills development: delivered key functional and leadership training through accelerated on-demand learning programmes, which in return improved productivity and overall performance. Employee engagement: our new annual employee engagement survey achieved an 87% response rate, with an overall engagement score of 79%. Voluntary attrition: voluntarily attrition rate dropped from 9.5% to 6.6%.

The opportunities ahead are exciting: there is a clear recognition that the services we provide are key to progressing Nigeria on a new, digital trajectory of growth.

Nigeria has a growing population of more than 200 million people, more than half of whom are under 30 years old - and the Nigerian government, as well as external experts such as the World Bank, see digital entrepreneurship as an engine of economic transformation for the country. We are well-placed to continue serving this need, investing this year in network upgrades to boost capacity and reinforce resilience, and making further progress on expanding our distribution network, while developing our offer to customers. New National Identity Number NIN regulations introduced in December 2020, which require every phone user to have a registered NIN, have temporarily slowed customer onboarding across the telecoms sector, as we describe on page 21. Despite this, we have widened our customer base during the year overall, and seen a rapid rise in data consumption contributing to double-digit revenue growth. In January 2021, we renewed our spectrum licences in the 900MHz and 1800MHz band, valid for ten years from 1 December 2021 - an important development we describe on page 21. We continue to progress our application for a licence to offer payment services independently, as we see a major opportunity to complement our existing financial services partnership with a local bank, which uses our platform for financial transactions. We also closely monitor Nigeria's foreign exchange situation: our analysis of foreign exchange risk is described on page 17 in our Covid-19 statement. Our focus on customers, communities and employees has been more important than ever this year. As everyone in Nigeria tackled the urgent demands of Covid-19, our teams pulled together to provide vital support, whether through testing centres, free SMS and data services, or resilient services that were essential to people's everyday lives and the national response. It was an effort that we can recall with pride as we help our communities build back stronger in 2021. For more information on our response to Covid-19, see page 16 Other market participants MTN Globacom 9 Mobile Our performance Revenue grew by 13.1% in reported currency, with constant currency growth of 21.9% offset by Nigerian naira devaluation of 10% YoY. Reported currency revenue grew by 12.0% in Q4'21, and 22.9% in constant currency. Voice revenue grew by 13.9% in the year. This was driven by customer base growth of 0.5%, and voice ARPU growth of 2.9%, supported by an increase in voice usage per customer, up 12.4%. The customer base growth was supported by continued expansion of our distribution network and network infrastructure, with a slowdown in customer base growth in the second half of the year attributable to new Know Your Customer KYC requirements in Nigeria. In Q4'21, voice revenue grew by 12.9% in constant currency, mainly driven by voice ARPU growth of 7.5%, largely due to increased voice usage per customer. Data revenue continues to be the key driver of Nigeria revenue growth, with constant currency revenue growth of 36.2%. This was driven by 5.6% growth in the number of data customers, and 15.3% growth in data ARPU. The data customer base growth was supported by expansion of our 4G network, with 84% of total sites now on 4G. Data customer penetration increased to 42.1%, up 2 percentage points Putting our business at the service of customers and communities While we never lost sight of how crucial it was to keep our mobile and data services running in Nigeria during the Covid-19 pandemic, we also looked for innovative ways we could help our communities through the worst of the crisis. We used our platforms to make sure people got the information they needed - both about Covid-19 see page 12 for a description of our communications work on behalf of the National Center for Disease Control NCDC, and for their education, through partnerships that meant vulnerable children continued to get access to online learning resources. At the same time we supported the government's efforts to combat Covid-19, including through a N200m equivalent of $525,000 donation to refurbish and equip a specialist unit at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, and donations to the Ogun State government to support Covid-19 testing through a molecular laboratory. We also supported the Nigerian Port Health Authority, provided toll-free lines to the 36 State Government offices, and donated N50m equivalent of approx. $132,000 to Lagos State Government to procure personal protective equipment PPE for Lagos State health workers, among other initiatives. Our employees led the way: through our Employee Volunteer Scheme EVS, they donated N20m equivalent of approx. $52,500 from their salaries to the Lagos State government to provide relief materials and palliative packs to vulnerable families and individuals. Transforming lives spotlight from the prior year. Data ARPU increased 15.3% from increased data usage per customer, which was up 47.4% in the year from 1.9 GB per month to 2.8 GB per month. Q4'21 data usage was 3.2 GB per customer. Data revenue accounted for 35.4% of total revenue in the year, up 3.7 percentage points from 31.7% in the prior year. Other revenue grew by 29.7%, with the main contribution coming from growth in VAS revenue, led by airtime credit services. Underlying EBITDA grew by 12.8% to $839m in reported currency, with a constant currency growth of 21.6%. At 54.1%, the underlying EBITDA margin was broadly in line with the prior year. The slight decline year on year in the Q4 underlying EBITDA margin to 54.8% from 55.5% was due to increased operating expenses, largely from the rollout of new sites over 1,400 added in the year. Capital expenditure was $275m, marginally lower than the prior year, largely due to logistical challenges faced during the pandemic. Operating free cash flow was $564m, up 53.6%, from the combination of underlying EBITDA growth and capex reduction.

To continue serving our customers, we're focused on making our services accessible. That has meant continuing to invest in network upgrades: our Kenya and Tanzania 4G networks are now best-in-class, and we continue to maintain 4G leadership in Malawi, Uganda and Zambia. We have significantly improved our customer experience by using the Airtel app to enhance digital support, and by simplifying customer journeys on our platforms. We also continue to deploy our distribution network closer to our customers by rolling out more service centres across urban and rural areas. Perhaps the strongest example this year has been the expansion of our Airtel Money branch and kiosk footprint by 73.4% and 11.5% respectively, which has brought financial inclusion and connectivity to more customers while driving significant growth for our business. The Covid-19 pandemic, which continues to have an impact on people's lives across our markets, has again shed light on how crucial telecoms services are to our communities and economies. Over the course of the year, we helped millions of families and businesses stay connected. The pandemic has also accelerated the adoption of new ways of working that bridge barriers between homes, offices and business places, and we have pushed forward with the expansion of our FTTH Fibre To The Home and FTTB Fibre To The Business portfolios, which both rely on our 54,500 kilometres of fibre across Africa. Above all, the year has shown that we are all at our strongest when we work together with all stakeholders, including governments, the health sector, communities, businesses and our customers.

The growth in revenue was evident across all key business segments: with voice up 15.4%, data up 23.9% and mobile money growing 47.2% in constant currency. Constant currency revenue growth of 23.5% was partially offset by currency devaluation, mainly in Zambia and Kenya. Reported currency revenue grew by 15.4% in Q4'21, and 23.9% in constant currency. Voice revenue grew by 15.4% for the year, driven by customer base growth of 9.2% and voice ARPU growth of 2.9%. Customer base growth was driven largely by the expansion of our distribution network, with the number of activating outlets up 15.5%. Voice ARPU growth was driven largely by the increase in voice usage per customer of 18.3%, to 330 minutes per customer per month. In Q4'21, voice revenue grew by 15.5% in constant currency, mainly driven by the customer base growth of 9.2% and ARPU growth of 5.3%. Data revenue grew by 23.9%, driven by data customer base growth of 21.5% and data ARPU growth of 1.1%. Growth was recorded across all OpCos in the region, driven by expansion of our 4G network infrastructure, with 76% of sites now on 4G in East Africa, compared with 66% during the prior year. Total data usage on the network grew by 70.7%, led by the 39.3% increase in data usage per customer per month to 2.7 GB per customer from 1.9 GB in the prior year, and from the data customer base growth. During the period 'pay-as-you-go' PAYG tariffs in certain markets were revised and this resulted in change of revenue allocation of bundled products between voice and data in these tariffs. On a like-for-like basis, voice and data revenue growth was 11% and 32.6% respectively. Mobile money revenue grew by 47.2%, largely driven by growth in Tanzania, Zambia, Uganda and Malawi. Revenue growth was driven by 16.4% growth in the customer base and 28.6% growth in the transaction value per customer, thanks largely to the expansion of our distribution network. The increase in transaction value per customer was the main contributor to mobile money ARPU growth of 16.0%. Consistent with the year, Q4 posted mobile money revenue growth of 47.8% in constant currency. Underlying EBITDA margin was 45.7%, an improvement of 529 basis points in reported currency and 541 basis points in constant currency, led by both accelerated growth in revenue and efficiency improvement in operating expenses. Capital expenditure was $249m, up 37.5% due to planned network expansion. Operating free cash flow was $382m, up 42%, largely due to the growth in underlying EBITDA. 'Let's Read': working in partnership to help improve education for 1.4 million children We have a long track record of supporting education projects by harnessing our data and network capabilities, which will continue to be a focus of our new sustainability strategy. Our partnership work in Zambia is a great example: this year we partnered with the 'Let's Read' project being rolled out to five provinces in Zambia as part of a USAID funded five-year programme led by the Education Development Center, Inc. EDC. Airtel Zambia provided more than 2,000 data SIM cards for the programme, to support the development of primary school teachers with the aim of improving the reading outcomes for approximately 1.4 million children attending pre-primary kindergarten through Grade 3.

And it showed that the delivery of our strategy, with a focus on distribution, network and pricing, can meet these customer needs while fuelling our growth.

More than 165 million people live in our Francophone Africa segment, which is made up of Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Madagascar, Niger, Republic of the Congo, and the Seychelles. This year, we got closer to many more new and existing customers through the rapid expansion of our distribution network, increasing our retail outlets by 43.7% to over 65,000. This expansion was made possible by our continuing investment in our network's capacity and resilience. Major projects this year in Niger and Chad serve as an example of our work in building infrastructure that is bringing communities into the mobile and digital ecosystem. Across the segment around 60% of our sites are now on 4G. This growth in capacity came at the right time for customers facing new challenges brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. Our field teams were able to keep working as essential service providers, increasing both the quality and availability of our network as people turned to mobile voice and data to stay connected and keep businesses running. We also helped meet the need for mobile money services within economies and households, by expanding the availability of Airtel Money services at the height of the pandemic. Our expanded network of Airtel Money branches and kiosks supported a substantial increase in our mobile money customer base and transaction volumes across the region. With a strong foundation provided by our networks and expanded distribution footprint, combined with the region's young and growing populations, we see huge opportunities to continue serving customers and driving sustainable growth for us, and the communities we support.

The growth in reported currency is higher than in constant currency due to appreciation of the Central African franc. Performance across the region was mixed, with revenue growth in Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC, Gabon and Niger, partially offset by marginal decline in other countries in the region. In Q4, revenue growth was significantly higher, at 20.9% in reported currency and 15.9% in constant currency. Voice revenue growth was broadly flat at 0.5%. This marginal underlying growth reflects 14.5% growth in the customer base largely coming later in the year balanced with a decline in voice ARPU due to a reduction in roaming revenue and interconnect rates. Q4'21 reflected an improvement in voice revenues of 7.3%, driven by customer base growth of 14.5% offset by a slight decline in voice ARPU of 3.6%, mainly due to reductions in roaming revenue and interconnect rates in Chad and Gabon. Q4'21 total voice minutes on the network grew by 27.0% due to increased voice usage per customer up 14.1% and customer base growth. Data revenue grew by 31.9% driven by customer growth of 24.6% and data ARPU growth of 2.8%. Data usage per customer increased 51.7% to 1.9 GB per month, from 1.3 GB per customer per month in the prior Digitalisation through 4G connectivity: Niger The success of our data business in Niger provides a clear example of how focusing on the reach and quality of our network can drive growth by bringing more customers across the digital divide. We're the network leaders in the country, the first business to bring 4G coverage to Niger's cities, and the operator with the largest combined 3G and 4G network. And we'five expanded our network to cover an increasing number of rural areas, bringing internet access to many places for the very first time. We put that network strength and speed to good use by focusing on connecting new smartphone customers to 4G, and converting existing customers, while also driving adoption of home broadband, including through pocket Wi-Fi technology that allows 3G smartphone users to connect to the 4G network. And we'five made sure we're making the right offer to our customers, reviewing all our data packages and building trust with our customers through transparent bundle deals. The result is that more people than ever before in Niger now have access to data and the digital economy. We'five seen a rise in data usage, a rise in data customers, and an increase in data revenue of nearly 46% this year. Our network has the potential to transform Niger, provide a solid platform for building the country's digital economy, and empower its people. Our data strategy in action year. The data customer base growth was driven largely by the expansion of our 4G network, with 60% of total sites now on 4G, and the success of our 'more for more' bundle offerings, driving data uptake by customers. Mobile money revenue grew by 15.0% largely driven by a 30.6% increase in the mobile money customer base, supported by the expansion of our distribution network through more agents up 29.6% and Airtel Money branches up 91.5%. Underlying EBITDA margin was 37.7% during the period, an improvement of 363 basis points in constant currency. The Q4'21 underlying EBITDA margin of 42.1%, reflects an improvement of 9.4 percentage points in constant currency, driven by revenue growth and increased efficiency in operating expenses. Capital expenditure was $88m, lower for the year, mainly due to a significant network modernisation project last year. Operating free cash flow was $276m, up 68.2% year on year, due to the improvement in underlying EBITDA and lower capital expenditure.

Demand for voice services continues to grow as mobile penetration within the region increases. While we'five seen changes in usage patterns during the Covid-19 pandemic, with an impact on traffic and revenues during hours when curfews were in place, this was mitigated by our increased distribution: our overall ARPU grew by 7.7% compared to 2019 20. Our mobile voice business line - which includes preand post-paid wireless voice services, international roaming, fixed-line phone services and interconnect revenue - contributed 53.6% to our consolidated revenue in 2020 21. Data has been another area of strong performance. Our focus is on simple and affordable data products that are transparent to customers, including 'more for more' data bundles, to encourage data use. While smartphone penetration across the continent increased less than expected, partly because of smartphone supply issues caused by Covid-19, it nonetheless increased by 1.0 percentage points in 2020 21 to 33%. We see the trend towards smartphone adoption only going in one direction, and we're continuing to invest in our 4G network, reinforcing our position as leaders in 4G in most markets. Altogether, we'five seen strong growth in data customer numbers, rapid expansion of data usage, and increased revenue. Both voice and data performance improvements are only possible because of our foundation in two key areas: network and distribution. Upgrading and expanding our network builds our capacity and resilience, so we can keep customers connected. We continue to focus on making sure our Airtel shops, Airtel kiosks, and agents are as close as possible to customers, increasing our exclusive retail footprint by 73% this year. For more information on our response to Covid-19, see page 16 Our performance Underlying revenue for mobile services grew by 11.9% in reported currency and by 17.6% in constant currency, with both voice and data revenue contributing to the growth. Voice revenue increased 11.0% in constant currency, driven by customer base growth of 6.9% driven by expansion of the distribution network and network infrastructure. The slight slowdown in customer base growth was due to new KYC regulations in Nigeria, excluding Nigeria the customer base grew by 10.7%. Voice usage per customer increased 16.4% to 234 minutes per customer, resulting in overall minutes growth of 29.1%. Voice revenue in Q4'21 grew by 12.8% with an improved performance across all regions. Data revenue grew by 31.2% in constant currency, largely driven by an increase in the data customer base and data usage growth. The data customer base grew by 14.5%, driven by expansion of our 4G network infrastructure, with 76.5% of sites now operating on 4G, compared with 64.7% in the prior year, and increased smartphone penetration up 1 percentage points. The data customer base as a proportion of total customers reached 34.3%, an increase of 2.3 percentage points. Total data usage on our network grew by 74.8%, led by an increase in data usage per customer and the growth of the data customer base. Data usage per customer per month was 2.6 GB, up 44.2% year on year, largely driven by our 4G network expansion and increasingly popular data bundle offerings. Growing penetration on our 4G network helped drive up data ARPU growth to 8.2%, with 4G data usage more than doubling and contributing 62.2% to total data usage on the network in Q4'21. Data revenue contribution reached 29.8% of total Group revenue, up from 27.2% in the prior year. Keeping students connected as they learned from home in Gabon Distance learning became the new normal for students in many of our markets in the Covid-19 pandemic - and we worked with a range of partners to help schools keep children's education on track. In Gabon, we supported the Ministry of National Education by enabling free access to education websites in the government's 'Learn from Home' programme. And Airtel employees lent a hand through our '1 employee, 1 school kit' initiative, collecting school supplies to support children at the El-Jireh orphanage in Essassa.

Airtel Money is part of this transformation, which is driving financial inclusion at scale as well as creating huge opportunities for business growth as customers adopt new and wider ways to store, send, and spend their money. Our digital mobile financial services platform caters to a large addressable market characterised by limited access to formal financial institutions and a lack of banking infrastructure. It includes mobile wallet deposit and withdrawals, merchant and commercial payments, benefits transfers, loans and savings, virtual credit cards and international money transfers. Our partnerships with Ecobank, Standard Chartered Bank, Mastercard, Western Union, MoneyGram, WorldRemit, and Mukuru, and remittance aggregators like Homesend, MFS Africa, Terrapay and Thunes, are broadening our offer, and helping us onboard more customers. Growth % are in constant currency Underlying EBITDA margin Strategic report 46 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: BusinessXreviews v93 Modification Date: 25 May 2021 5:18 pm We offer mobile money services directly to customers in 13 of our 14 markets. In Nigeria, Airtel Money services are offered by a licensed bank using Airtel Nigeria network. We have applied for our own mobile banking licence see our Nigeria Business review on page 38. Our customers benefit from Airtel Africa's strong network presence and our extensive distribution platform of kiosks, mini shops, and dedicated Airtel Money branches, as well as our extensive agent network. To drive sustainable long-term growth, we're focused on assured float availability, distribution expansion and increased use cases for our customers. In 2020 21, our network grew to 37,000 kiosks, 10,000 Airtel Money branches and shops and more than 440,000 Airtel Money agents, creating valuable employment opportunities while building greater convenience and accessibility for customers. These have been important drivers of the 18.5% growth in our customer base. We also aim to increase the penetration of our services by developing the mobile money ecosystem and making Airtel Money easier to use. We made our user interface simpler through our self-care app, we continue to partner with other financial institutions to drive mobile banking services, and we're developing products to help drive the growth and uptake of merchant payments, business to customer bulk payments and customer to business payments. We're also building Application Programming Interfaces APIs to allow further integration with other partners and technologies. In 2020 21, we saw a significant shift in customer behaviour, including a 53.6% increase in transaction volume, with notable increases in the use of bank to wallet transfers, international money transfers, and merchant or bill payments. This reflects a worldwide movement towards the adoption of digital payments, and while this may have been accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, we see it as indicative of the long-term trend. We believe this behaviour change creates a significant opportunity, which informs our approach to the strategic monetisation of our mobile services, described below. At the same time, in recognition of the hardships faced by many customers and communities in dealing with the pandemic this year, we made a range of Airtel Money services complimentary. For more information on our response to Covid-19, see page 16 Widening financial inclusion We're addressing the lack of banking services in our markets through services that include: Mobile banking Merchant payments Loans Savings International money transfers Insurance Virtual cards Our performance Mobile money revenue grew by 35.5% to $401m driven by 18.5% growth of the customer base and transaction value growth of 53.6%. Customer base growth was largely driven by expansion of our distribution network, as we continued to invest in exclusive kiosks and mobile money branches. Throughout the year, the expansion of our mobile money product portfolio, through partnerships with leading financial institutions, and the expansion of our merchant ecosystem further strengthened our mobile money propositions. Underlying EBITDA for mobile money grew by 30.5% to $195m in reported currency. In constant currency, underlying EBITDA grew by 36.2%. Underlying EBITDA margin was 48.7%, an improvement Realising Airtel Money's potential through strategic investment Two recent announcements in March and April 2021 demonstrate how we're unlocking value by bringing in strategic investors in our mobile money business. The Rise Fund, the global impact investing platform of leading alternative investment firm TPG, will invest $200m in Airtel Mobile Commerce BV AMC BV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Airtel Africa plc. We are in discussions with other potential investors in relation to possible further minority investments into Airtel Money, up to a total of 25% of the issued share capital of AMC BV. AMC BV is currently the holding company for several of Airtel Africa's mobile money operations: and is now intended to own and operate the mobile money businesses across all of Airtel Africa's 14 operating countries. Airtel Africa and Mastercard have also signed a new commercial framework which will deepen our partnerships in areas including card issuance, payment gateway, payment processing, merchant acceptance and remittance solutions, amongst others. Both transactions valued our mobile money business at $2.65bn on a cash and debt-free basis. Airtel Africa continues to hold the remaining majority stake. The proceeds will be used to reduce our Group debt, and invest in network and sales infrastructure in our markets. Our mobile money strategy in action of 27 basis points. The growth in total transaction value in constant currency, of 53.6%, was driven by customer base growth of 18.5% and growth in the transaction value per customer per month of 20.9%. The Q4'21 annualised transaction value reached $51bn in constant currency, with mobile money revenue accounting for 10.6% of total revenue in the quarter. The mobile money customer base reached 21.7 million, up 18.5% from the prior year, with Airtel Money customers now representing 18.3% of our total customer base, an increase of 1.8 percentage points. Mobile money ARPU increased 6.6%, driven by the increase in transaction values and a higher contribution from merchant payments, cash transactions, P2P transfers and mobile services recharges through Airtel Money.

They show that even in the uncertain times caused by Covid-19, we are capturing growth opportunities in a fast-growing region that remains vastly underpenetrated in terms of both mobile and banking services - opportunities that simultaneously further our ambitions to bridge digital divides and drive financial inclusion. Strategic report 60 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: FinancialXreview v79 Modification Date: 26 May 2021 8:20 am From a financial perspective, we focused on four main objectives this year. Growing our operating profitability Our first objective was to continue supporting the business to enhance operating profitability through higher revenue extraction and EBITDA flowthrough by focusing on operating cost. As the review below describes in detail, operating profit grew by 24.2% in reported currency, with constant currency growth of 32.8%, constant currency growth was partially offset by currency devaluation. Improving our return on capital Our second objective was to improve our return on capital by making sure our capex was deployed adroitly. This is one of the key measures we track, so that we can monitor how assets are performing while taking long-term financing into consideration. Our return on capital employed was 16.5%, an improvement of 2.5 percentage points. Strengthening our balance sheet and improving leverage Third, we sought to strengthen our balance sheet through a continuous focus on deleveraging our debt position as a result of EBITDA expansion, asset monetisation and strategic investment opportunities. Our leverage net debt to underlying EBITDA improved to 2.0x 2.1x as of 31 March 2020 despite investing $247m of intangible capex to renew licences in two of our largest markets, Nigeria and Uganda, and acquiring additional spectrum across a few of our markets. This is a longstanding focus for the business, and our aim is to reduce our leverage ratio further and keep it below 2.0x, which is the anchor of our capital structure policy. The investments by The Rise Fund of $200m, and $100m by Mastercard, in Airtel Mobile Commerce BV, described on page 47, demonstrate our strategy to bring fresh investments into our mobile money business. We have announced our intention to explore the potential listing of our mobile money business within four years. We also entered into an agreement to sell our telecommunications tower companies in Madagascar and Malawi, and into exclusive Memorandum of Understanding agreements for the potential sale of our tower assets in Chad and Gabon. As part of our strategy to achieve effective natural hedging in our balance sheet, we have reduced the foreign currency exposure by increasing the local currency market debt to 14%, from 10% of total market debt in previous period. As set out in Note 2.2 to the financial statements on page 154, as of the date of authorisation of the financial statements, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of more than $1.1bn. This strengthens our liquidity position for sustainable business growth and repayment of market debt as and when falling due. A challenge that we have faced over the last 12 months has been low availability of foreign currency in Nigeria and, as a consequence, being unable to fully benefit at Group level from the strong cash generation of our local business. However, during the year this had no material impact on our liquidity at Group level as we continue to access liquidity broadly across the rest of our footprint. This challenge is still on going and we continue to closely monitor the situation. See how we manage our risks, on pages 72-78 4. Returns to shareholders Our fourth objective was to enhance returns to shareholders over the mediumto longer-term horizon. During the year, the Board approved a new progressive dividend policy, which aims to grow the dividend annually by a midto highsingle-digit percentage from a base of 4 cents per share for financial year 2020 21, until reported leverage falls below 2.0x. We paid an interim Reported revenue grew by 14.2% to $3,908m, with Q4'21 reported revenue growth of 15.4%. Constant currency underlying revenue growth was 19.4%, with Q4'21 growth of 21.7%. Growth was recorded across all regions: Nigeria up 21.9%, East Africa up 23.5% and Francophone Africa up 10%: and across key services, with revenues for voice up 11.0%, data up 31.2% and mobile money up 35.5%. Underlying EBITDA was $1,792m, up 18.3% in reported currency, and growing 25.2% in constant currency. Underlying EBITDA margin was 46.1%, adding 181 basis points 210 basis points higher in constant currency. Underlying EBITDA margin for Q4'21 was 47.7%, an increase of 389 basis points in constant currency. Operating profit increased 24.2% to $1,119m in reported currency, and by 32.8% in constant currency. Free cash flow was $647m, up 42.8% on the prior year. Basic EPS was 9.0 cents, down 12.6%, largely due to prior year exceptional items and a one-off derivative gain. Excluding these, basic restated EPS rose 44.5%. EPS before exceptional items was 8.2 cents. Our customer base grew by 6.9% to 118.2 million, with increased penetration across mobile data customer base up 14.5% and mobile money services customer base up 18.5%. The recent slowdown in customer base growth has been due to the new SIM registration regulations in Nigeria The Board has recommended a final dividend of 2.5 cents per share, making the total dividend for FY21 4 cents per share Performance highlights dividend of 1.5 cents per ordinary share in December 2020. The Board recommended a final dividend of 2.5 cents per share. Basic earnings per share reduced from 10.3 cents to 9.0 cents in financial year 2020 21. However, normalising the one-time gain of exceptional items, restated earnings per share improved from 6.9 cents to 8.2 cents. Outlook: helping customers and communities bounce back The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we are wellpositioned to help our customers and communities as economies in our region begin their projected return to GDP growth. We will continue to look at further strategic investment and asset monetisation opportunities, and to further rebalance our foreign and local currency exposure to achieve a more effective natural hedging of our balance sheet, so that we can continue to be a strong, high-performing business at the heart of sub-Saharan Africa's digital future. Jaideep Paul Chief financial officer 11 May 2021 61 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 Strategic report c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: FinancialXreview v79 Modification Date: 26 May 2021 8:20 am Financial review Summary These results continue to demonstrate the effective execution of our strategy, delivering strong revenue growth and the significant expansion of our underlying EBITDA margin. As a result, we were able to deliver double-digit underlying revenue growth of 17.6% in mobile services in constant currency 11.9% in reported currency and 35.5% revenue growth in mobile money services 29.1% in reported currency. Basic EPS was 9.0 cents, lower than the 10.3 cents from the prior year, largely a result of the lower number of average shares in the previous period EPS impact of 0.5 cents, an increase in tax charges due to higher operating profits and withholding tax on dividends by subsidiaries, a one-off derivative gain in the prior year amounting to $47m in other finance costs, and recognition of a one-off gain of $72m related to the expired indemnity to certain pre-IPO investors which was accounted for as an exceptional item. Noncontrolling interest more than doubled largely due to improved profits in several operating companies OpCos with minority shareholdings, including Airtel Malawi, Airtel Niger and Airtel Tanzania. Excluding exceptional items and the one-off $47m derivative gain, basic restated EPS increased by 44.5%. GAAP measures Revenue Reported revenue grew by 14.2%, driven by 19.4% growth in underlying constant currency revenue, partially offset by currency devaluations, mainly in the Nigerian naira 10%, Zambian kwacha 34% and Kenyan shilling 5.7%, in turn partially offset by appreciation in the Central African franc 7.1%. Reported revenue benefited from a one-time exceptional revenue of $20m relating to a settlement in Niger. Operating profit Operating profit was $1,119m, up 24.2% in reported currency, largely a function of strong revenue growth and lower operating expenditures in proportion to revenue. In constant currency operating profit grew by 32.8%. Net finance costs Net finance costs were $423m, an increase of $51m, driven by higher other finance costs which more than offset the reduced interest costs of $8m from lower average gross debt. The increase in other finance costs was due to a one-off derivative gain of $47m in the previous year. Taxation Total tax charges increased $92m, to $282m. The increase in tax charges was due to higher operating profits and withholding tax on dividends by subsidiaries. The prior year also benefited from the recognition of higher deferred tax credit of $51m in the DRC compared with only $36m in Tanzania during the current year.

This was largely flat compared with the previous year a result of the prior period recognition of a one-off gain of $72m related to the expired indemnity to certain pre-IPO investors and a higher deferred tax credit of $15m and one-off derivative gain of $47m in the prior year, as well as higher tax in the current year. Excluding the prior year benefits from exceptional items and the one-off derivative gain, profit after tax increased 47%. Basic EPS Basic EPS was 9.0 cents, reduced from 10.3 cents in the prior year, due to the lower number of average shares in the previous period EPS impact of 0.5 cents, several one-off gains in the prior year: i derivative gain of $47m in other finance costs, ii higher exceptional item benefits of $51m mainly from the recognition of a one-off gain of $72m related to the expired indemnity to certain pre-IPO investors, iii an increase in tax charges due to higher operating profit and withholding tax on dividends by subsidiaries, and iv higher non-controlling interests due to higher profit contributions in OpCos with minority shareholdings. Excluding exceptional items and the one-off $47m derivative gain, basic EPS increased 44.5%. The $38m increase in non-controlling interest up 100.8%, mainly reflects higher profit contributions from OpCos with minority shareholdings, including Airtel Malawi, Airtel Niger and Airtel Tanzania. Alternative performance measures Underlying revenue Underlying revenue growth of 19.4% in constant currency was primarily driven by the combination of 6.9% customer base growth to 118.2 million, and 7.7% ARPU growth. Underlying revenue growth was recorded across all our regions: Nigeria growing by 21.9%, East Africa by 23.5% and Francophone Africa by 10%. Double-digit revenue growth was also achieved across all our service segments, with voice growing 11.0%, data 31.2% and mobile money 35.5%, all in constant currency. Reported currency revenue growth further accelerated to 15.4% in Q4'21, with constant currency revenue growth of 21.7%. Underlying EBITDA Underlying EBITDA, at $1,792m, increased 18.3% in reported currency while in constant currency underlying EBITDA grew by 25.2%. The growth in underlying EBITDA was driven by underlying revenue growth of 19.4% and improved efficiency in operating expenses. Underlying EBITDA margin was 46.1%, an improvement of 181 basis points in reported currency and 210 basis points in constant currency. Foreign exchange had an adverse impact of $171m on revenue and $86m on underlying EBITDA, reflecting currency devaluations, mainly the Nigerian naira, Zambian kwacha and Kenya shilling, partially offset by appreciation in the Central African franc. Underlying EBITDA margin in Q4'21 was 47.7%, an improvement of 354 basis points in reported currency and 389 basis points in constant currency.

Tax The effective tax rate was 43.2% compared to 48.6% in the prior year, largely a result of profit mix changes amongst the OpCos. The effective tax rate is higher than the weighted average statutory corporate tax rate of approximately 33%, largely due to the profit mix between various OpCos and higher withholding tax on dividends by subsidiaries. The adjusted effective tax rate was 38.2% compared to 38.7% in the previous period.

Exceptional items for the year ended 31 March 2020 mainly consisted of a $72m gain related to the expired indemnity to certain pre-IPO investors and a deferred tax credit of $51m in the DRC. Free cash flow Free cash flow was $647m, 42.8% higher than last year due to the combination of an increase in underlying EBITDA and slightly lower capex due to logistical challenges during the Covid-19 pandemic. This benefit was partially offset by an $81m increase in income tax paid resulting from higher operating profits.

Excluding the one-time derivative gain of $47m, restated EPS grew by 44.5%. The increase in non-controlling interest by $38m 100.8% is due to higher profits in several OpCos with minority shareholdings, including Airtel Malawi, Airtel Niger and Airtel Tanzania.

The increase in underlying EBITDA more than offset the increase in net debt. The Group's capex investment to support business growth remains broadly stable with a capex investment of $614m during the year ended 2020 21.

Previous year amount of $155m includes $128m for spectrum in Nigeria. Issue of share capital For the year ended 31 March 2020, this represents $680m net proceeds from the Airtel Africa plc IPO. Settlement of derivatives We took interest rate swap and currency swap contracts from various banks against our outstanding USD bonds. These bonds are all fixed-rate bonds, and to hedge our exposure from market interest rate fluctuations we entered fixed-to-floating interest rate swap IRS contracts for USD bonds. In the year ended 31 March 2020, these IRS contracts were cancelled and realised in cash for $122m. Further, in the year ended 31 March 2020, an amount of $25m was paid on maturity of derivatives taken against CHF bonds. Dividend paid to shareholders During the year, the Board approved a new progressive dividend policy. The newly adopted dividend policy aims to grow the dividend annually by a midto highsingle-digit percentage from a base of 4 cents per share for financial year 2020 21, until reported leverage falls below 2.0x. The Board will reassess the dividend policy in light of the growth outlook of the Group. March 2021 had a final dividend payment of 3.0 cents per ordinary share for year ended 31 March 2020 and an interim dividend payment of 1.5 cents per ordinary share. The Board recommended a final dividend of 2.5 cents per share. Others Others includes payment to capex creditors over and above capex incurred, share issue expenses and changes in non-operating working capital. Foreign exchange on borrowings and cash flows Foreign exchange on borrowings and cash flows for the year ended 31 March 2021 primarily represents loss on account of restatement of EUR bonds due to appreciation of EUR against US dollar. Financial information by service We provide performance data for our mobile voice and data services and Airtel Money in our business reviews on pages 44-47. Financial information by market We provide performance data for each of our markets in our business reviews on pages 38-43. Consolidated statement of financial position The consolidated statement of financial position is set out on page 151. Details on the major movements of our assets and liabilities in the year are set out on this page. Assets Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment including capital work in progress increased by $141m to $2,232m. This was due to capital expenditure of $614m linked to continued investment in network assets, which was partially offset by $389m of depreciation. Right of use assets Right of use assets increased by $160m to $799m. The increase of $359m was due to capitalisation of present value of telecommunication towers taken on long-term lease partially offset by $183m of depreciation. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets, including assets under development, increased by $249m to $735m. This relates to $270m of investment in licence spectrum and capitalisation of present value of deferred spectrum charges amounted to $102m partially offset by $109m of amortisation. Current assets Current assets increased by $234m to $1,905m largely contributed by: i cash and cash equivalents and other bank balances increased by $79m due to cash generated by the business, and ii balance held under mobile money trust - these increased by $145m: it represents the balance held on behalf of mobile money customers which is not available for use by the Group. Total equity and liabilities Equity attributable to owners of the company Equity attributable to the owners of the company increased by $17m to $3,405m. This was linked to the $339m profit for the period, partially offset by $169m dividend paid to shareholders of Airtel Africa and $140m other comprehensive losses primarily due to exchange losses. Borrowings Gross borrowings including short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term borrowings increased by $337m to $4,616m. This was largely due to increase in lease liabilities by $108m and drawdown of external loan. Net debt of the Group as of 31 March 2021 was $3,530m. Non-current liabilities Non-current liabilities excluding borrowings increased by $87m. This was largely due to a liability created against capitalisation of present value of deferred spectrum charges. Current liabilities Current liabilities excluding borrowings increased by $171m to $1,796m. This was largely due to a $140m increase in mobile money wallet balance. Further details on Group's liquidity position and going concern assessment are shown on page 154, note 2.2 of financial statements. Dividends The Board has recommended a final dividend of 2.5 cents per ordinary share for the year ended 31 March 2021. The proposed final dividend will be paid on 23 July 2021 to all ordinary shareholders who are on the register of members at the close of business on 25 June 2021. We will announce more details in due course. We paid an interim dividend of 1.5 cents per ordinary share in December 2020. Strategic report 66 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: FinancialXreview v79 Modification Date: 26 May 2021 8:20 am Alternative performance measures APMs Introduction In the reporting of financial information, the directors have adopted various APMs. These measures are not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with other companies' APMs, including those in our industry. APMs should be considered in addition to, and are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measurements. Purpose The directors believe that these APMs assist in providing additional useful information on the underlying trends, performance and position of the Group. APMs are also used to enhance the comparability of information between reporting periods and geographical units such as like-for-like sales, by adjusting for non-recurring or uncontrollable factors which affect IFRS measures, to aid users in understanding the Group's performance. Consequently, APMs are used by the directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive-setting purposes. The directors believe the following metrics to be the APMs used by the Group to help evaluate growth trends, establish budgets and assess operational performance and efficiencies. These measures provide an enhanced understanding of the Group's results and related trends, therefore increasing transparency and clarity into the core results of the business. The following metrics are useful in evaluating our operating performance: APM Closest equivalent IFRS measure Adjustment to reconcile to IFRS measure Table reference 1 Definition and purpose Underlying revenue Revenue Exceptional item Table A The Group defines underlying revenue as revenue for the period adjusted for exceptional items. The directors view underlying revenue to be a meaningful measure to analyse the Group's revenue, excluding exception items. Exceptional items are additional specific items that because of their size, nature or incidence in the results, are considered to hinder comparison of the Group's performance on a period to period basis and could distort the understanding of our performance for the period and the comparability between periods and hence are adjusted to arrive at underlying revenue. Underlying EBITDA and margin Operating profit Depreciation and amortisation Charity and donation Exceptional item Table B The Group defines underlying EBITDA as operating profit loss for the period before depreciation and amortisation, charity and donation, and adjusted for exceptional items. Group defines underlying EBITDA margin as underlying EBITDA divided by total underlying revenue. Underlying EBITDA and margin are measures used by the directors to assess the trading performance of the business and are therefore the measure of segment profit that the Group presents under IFRS. Underlying EBITDA and margin are also presented on a consolidated basis because the directors believe it is important to consider profitability on a basis consistent with that of the Group's operating segments. When presented on a consolidated basis, underlying EBITDA and margin are APMs. Depreciation and amortisation is a non-cash item which fluctuates depending on the timing of capital investment and useful economic life. directors believe that a measure which removes this volatility improves comparability of the Group's results period on period and hence is adjusted to arrive at underlying EBITDA and margin. Charity and donations are not related to the trading performance of the Group and hence adjusted to arrive at underlying EBITDA and margin. Exceptional items are additional specific items that because of their size, nature or incidence in the results, are considered to hinder comparison of the Group's performance on a period to period basis and could distort the understanding of our performance for the period and the comparability between periods and hence are adjusted to arrive at underlying EBITDA and margin. 67 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 Strategic report c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: APMs v33 Modification Date: 25 May 2021 5:37 pm Alternative performance measures APMs continued APM Closest equivalent IFRS measure Adjustment to reconcile to IFRS measure Table reference 1 Definition and purpose Underlying profit Loss before tax Profit loss before tax Exceptional items Table C The Group defines underlying profit loss before tax as profit loss before tax adjusted for exceptional items. The directors view underlying profit loss before tax to be a meaningful measure to analyse the Group's profitability. Exceptional items are additional specific items that because of their size, nature or incidence in the results, are considered to hinder comparison of the Group's performance on a period to period basis and could distort the understanding of our performance for the period and the comparability between periods and hence are adjusted to arrive at underlying profit loss before tax. Effective tax rate Reported tax rate Exceptional items Foreign exchange rate movements One-off tax impact of prior period, tax litigation settlement and impact of tax on permanent differences Table D The Group defines effective tax rate as reported tax rate reported tax charge divided by reported profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items, foreign exchange rate movements and one-off tax items of prior year adjustment, tax settlements and impact of permanent differences on tax. This provides an indication of the current ongoing tax rate across the Group. Exceptional items are additional specific items that because of their size, nature or incidence in the results, are considered to hinder comparison of the Group's performance on a period to period basis and could distort the understanding of our performance for the period and the comparability between periods and hence are adjusted to arrive at effective tax rate. Foreign exchange rate movements are specific items that are non-tax deductible in few of the entities which are loss making and where DTA is not yet triggered and hence are considered to hinder comparison of the Group's effective tax rate on a period to period basis and therefore excluded to arrive at effective tax rate. One-off tax impact on account of prior year adjustment, any tax litigation settlement and tax impact on permanent differences are additional specific items that because of their size and frequency in the results, are considered to hinder comparison of the Group's effective tax rate on a period to period basis. Adjusted effective tax rate Reported tax rate Deferred tax triggered during the year and accounted as exceptional tax item Table D The Group defines adjusted effective tax rate as effective tax rate after normalizing any impact arising on account of deferred tax triggered during the year for the first time which has been reported as exceptional item. This provides an indication of the tax rate across the Group for the current financial year after considering any deferred tax triggered during the year. Underlying profit loss after tax Profit loss for the period Exceptional items Table E The Group defines underlying profit loss after tax as profit loss for the period adjusted for exceptional items. The directors view underlying profit loss after tax to be a meaningful measure to analyse the Group's profitability. Exceptional items are additional specific items that because of their size, nature or incidence in the results, are considered to hinder comparison of the Group's performance on a period to period basis and could distort the understanding of our performance for the period and the comparability between periods and hence are adjusted to arrive at underlying profit loss after tax. Earnings per share before exceptional items EPS Exceptional items Table F The Group defines earnings per share before exceptional items as profit loss for the period before exceptional items attributable to owners of the company divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial period. This measure reflects the earnings per share before exceptional items for each share unit of the company. Exceptional items are additional specific items that because of their size, nature or incidence in the results, are considered to hinder comparison of the Group's performance on a period to period basis and could distort the understanding of our performance for the period and the comparability between periods and hence are adjusted to arrive at earnings for the purpose of earnings per share before exceptional items.

The Group views operating free cash flow as a key liquidity measure, as it indicates the cash available to pay dividends, repay debt or make further investments in the Group. Free cash flow Cash generated from operating activities Changes in working capital Capital expenditure Income tax paid Cash interest Table I The Group defines free cash flow as net cash generated from operating activities after change in operating working capital, income tax paid and cash interest. It is calculated as 'underlying EBITDA less change in operating working capital, capital expenditure, income tax paid and cash interest'. The Group views free cash flow as a key liquidity measure, as it indicates the cash available to pay dividends, repay debt or make further investments in the Group. Net debt and leverage ratio No direct equivalent Borrowing Lease liabilities Cash and cash equivalent Term deposits with banks Fair value hedges Table J The Group defines net debt as borrowings including lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents, term deposits with banks, processing costs related to borrowings and fair value hedge adjustments. The Group defines leverage ratio as net debt divided by underlying EBITDA. The directors view net debt and the leverage ratio to be meaningful measures to monitor the Group's ability to cover its debt through its earnings. Return on capital employed No direct equivalent Exceptional items to arrive at underlying EBIT Table K Group defines return on capital employed 'ROCE' as underlying EBIT divided by average capital employed. The directors view return on capital employed as a financial ratio that measures Group's profitability and the efficiency with which its capital is being utilised. The Group defines underlying EBIT as operating profit loss for the period adjusted for exceptional items. Exceptional items are additional specific items that because of their size, nature or incidence in the results, are considered to hinder comparison of the Group's performance on a period to period basis and could distort the understanding of our performance for the period and the comparability between periods and hence are adjusted to arrive at underlying EBIT. Capital employed is defined as sum of equity attributable to owners of the company, non-controlling interests and net debt. Average capital employed is average of capital employed at the closing and beginning of the relevant period. 1 Refer to reconciliation between GAAP and alternative performance measures for respective table Some of the Group's IFRS measures and APMs are translated at constant currency exchange rates to measure organic performance of the Group. In determining the percentage change in constant currency terms, both current and previous financial reporting period's results have been converted using exchange rates prevailing as of 31 March 2020. Reported currency percentage change is derived on the basis of average actual periodic exchange rates for that financial period. Variance between constant currency and reported currency percentage are due to exchange rate movements between previous financial reporting period and current period. Changes to APMs Definition of underlying EBITDA margin has been clarified as underlying EBITDA divided by underlying revenue. Underlying revenue is included in the APM and is defined as revenue for the period adjusted for exceptional items. The reason for using underlying revenue is because exceptional revenue has been recorded for the first time in the year ended 31 March 2021. Return on capital employed has been included in the APM and is defined as underlying EBIT divided by average capital employed. ROCE is a financial ratio that measures Group's profitability and efficiency with which its capital is being utilised. 69 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 Strategic report c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: APMs v33 Modification Date: 25 May 2021 5:37 pm Alternative performance measures APMs continued Reconciliation between GAAP and Alternative Performance Measures Table A: Underlying revenue Description Year ended March 2021 $m March 2020 $m Revenue 3,908 3,422 Less: Exceptional items 20 - Underlying revenue 3,888 3,422 Table B: Underlying EBITDA and margin Description Year ended March 2021 $m March 2020 $m Operating profit 1,119 901 Add: Depreciation and amortisation 681 632 Charity and donation 6 5 Exceptional items 14 23 Underlying EBITDA 1,792 1,515 Revenue 3,888 3,422 Underlying EBITDA margin % 46.1% 44.3% Table C: Underlying profit loss before tax Description Year ended March 2021 $m March 2020 $m Profit loss before tax 697 598 Exceptional items net 14 65 Underlying profit loss before tax 683 533 Table D: Effective tax rate and adjusted effective tax rate Description March 2021 March 2020 Profit before taxation $m Income tax expense $m Tax rate % Profit before taxation $m Income tax expense $m Tax rate % Reported effective tax rate 697 282 40.5% 598 190 31.8% Adjusted for: Exceptional Items provided below 14 36 65 47 Foreign exchange rate movements for non-DTA OpCos and HoldCos 42 - 21 One-off tax adjustment 5 12 Effective tax rate 725 313 43.2% 512 249 48.6% Deferred tax triggered during the year 36 51 Adjusted effective tax rate 725 277 38.2% 512 198 38.7% Exceptional items 1.

For the purpose of our long-term viability assessment, the Board primarily focuses on liquidity. The three-year period of our viability assessment is in line with a three-year liquidity plan which matches the current visibility of the tenure of our financing arrangements and also the design and payout of the management incentive plan. While the Board has no reason to believe that the Group will not be viable over a longer period, given the inherent estimation uncertainty involved in forecasting liquidity assumptions over a longer period, the Board concluded that a three-year period provides a reasonable degree of confidence while still retaining a longer-term perspective. This plan has been prepared based on our strategy and adequate stress tests have been conducted through various scenarios, both individually and collectively, based on our overall risk assessment framework. The Covid-19 pandemic has contributed to a rapid acceleration of already existing macro trends across the countries where we operate, with people, businesses and governments seeking access to more and better connectivity and improved financial inclusion. These challenging times have shown that the telecoms industry is a key and essential service for these economies, allowing customers to work remotely, reduce their travel, keep connected and have access to affordable entertainment and financial services. Covid-19 presented significant challenges to the business, particularly during the initial phase of the pandemic when mobile money and services growth slowed. However, the actions taken by the Board in the first quarter enabled the continued execution of our strategy, including meeting increased customer demand for data, mobile money and mobile services. As a matter of prudence, we have given specific consideration to the impact of Covid-19 on our cash flows with the stress tests performed, including possible incremental revenue decline, an unanticipated increase in costs, currency devaluation and availability of funds for repatriation to the Group. Further, notwithstanding the possible impacts of Covid-19, the Group will continue to benefit from population growth and the need for increased connectivity and financial inclusion in the medium to long term in the countries where we operate. Our detailed assessment of the possible impact of Covid-19 is explained on pages 16-17 of the strategic report. The company ended the year in a strong financial position. Free cash flow increased by c. 43% in the last 12 months to $647m and our net debt to EBITDA ratio continued to improve to 2.0x at the end of this The preparation of this viability statement involved the Board assessing the Group's long-term prospects and ability to meet future commitments and liabilities as they fall due over the three-year review period including the stress tests on various scenarios to test the resilience and strength of our forecasts. Board's assessment Viability The viability statement is based on our current business model see page 22 of this report, a three-year prospect horizon, and our strategy see pages 24-31. Assessment of headroom based on forecast cash flows and sensitivities to assess our ability to meet future commitments and liabilities as they fall due over the next three years. Long-term plan and headroom analysis Our three-year plan has been prepared considering organic growth potential in the geographies where we operate. Principal risk assessment Our risk evaluation is described on pages 72 to 78. While each principal risk has been carefully evaluated both individually and collectively and an adequate monitoring and mitigation plan has been defined, we have also considered sensitivity analysis and stress tests on the three-year projections. Sensitivity We have quantified the impact of sensitivities on cash and liquidity headroom availability, both individually and collectively, in worst case scenarios. In assessing the impact, we have considered various mitigating actions which could be undertaken to ensure sufficient liquidity. Our cash balances, in conjunction with nearly $1.14bn of committed undrawn facilities at the date of approval of these financial statements, ensure we can continue to meet our financial obligations. We have $2.4bn in long-term bonds with the first repayment of $879m EU750m due in May 2021, which will be paid through a mix of cash held as well as from the proceeds of a $500m inaugural multi-bank long-term facility part of the above mentioned $1.14bn undrawn facilities entered into by Airtel Africa plc in April 2021. Post this repayment, only $1.5bn of long-term bonds will remain outstanding for the Group, with the next major bond repayment of $505m not due until March 2023. In recent months we have announced several transactions to strengthen our balance sheet, including asset monetisation through towerco sales, and bringing fresh investment into our mobile money business amounting in aggregate to c. $400m, with proceeds expected to be received in the next 12-18 months, which will further improve our financial position and continue our deleveraging. We have also concluded standalone credit rating assessments that will enable us to further access debt capital markets, as and when required. 79 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 Strategic report c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: ViabilityXstatement v30 Modification Date: 26 May 2021 8:21 am Our long-term viability statement continued The key risks considered in the stress tests keeping in mind the demographical and sectoral dynamics along with their potential negative impacts are detailed here. Stress tests done Link to principal risks and uncertainties Description Slowdown in revenue growth Adverse competition and market disruption Technology obsolescence Revenue is projected on a number of assumptions such as subscriber base, rates and change in average revenue per user. A change in any of the assumptions due to adverse competition and market disruption may affect overall revenue growth. In most cases, changes in one such assumption e. g. in rates are compensated either fully or marginally by a corresponding change in other variables e. g. subscriber base. Changes not fully compensated lead to a reduction in the rate of revenue growth. We have modelled stress test scenarios for various levels of slowdown across segments and revenue streams. Increase in operating expenses Increase in cost structure With operations spread across 14 markets and each country having a different economic and business environment, there is always a risk of operating costs increasing beyond projected levels. Unanticipated regulatory and tax levies Non-compliance to legal and regulatory requirements As we work in diverse and dynamic legal environments, it's necessary to establish and maintain adequate procedures, systems and controls to ensure we comply with our obligations in all the jurisdictions in which we operate. There will always be a risk of unanticipated regulatory and tax levies affecting our profitability and therefore additional tax and regulatory levies have been considered in the stress tests. Exchange rate fluctuation Exchange rate fluctuation and availability of foreign currency for repatriation to Group We are constantly exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations, given our operations in 14 different markets with different functional currencies. Furthermore, we could face low availability of foreign currency in some of our markets constraining our ability to fully benefit at the Group level from the strong cash generation of our local businesses. We have stress tested the plan for various levels of currency devaluation across operating entities, including the risk of availability of foreign exchange leading to repatriation of cash from operating entities to Group holding companies and the resulting impact on cash flows and liquidity headroom at a Group level. Covid-19 impact Uncertainties arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic The Covid-19 pandemic has contributed to a rapid acceleration of already existing macro trends across the countries where we operate, with people, businesses and governments seeking access to more and better connectivity and improved financial inclusion. It is in these challenging times that the telecoms industry has emerged as a key and essential service for these economies, allowing customers to work remotely, reduce their travel, keep connected and allow access to affordable entertainment and financial services. This has resulted in robust growth in all revenue streams for most of the telecom operators. We, on our part, have continued to work with governments, regulators, partners and suppliers to keep customers and businesses connected as well as supporting the economies and communities. We focused on expanding and maintaining our network to ensure it could cope with increasing demand, we kept our distribution up and running by increasing the penetration of digital recharges and stock levels, and we expanded our home broadband solutions to ensure customers could work and access entertainment remotely. Our detailed assessment of possible impact of Covid-19 is provided on pages 16-17 of this report. We have carried out extensive scenario analysis looking at the possible negative effect of the outbreak on the business via a possible reduction in revenue growth and a possible increase in operating expenses. Conclusion The results of stress-testing our forecasts over the three-year period for the above sensitivities, including the possible impact of Covid-19, demonstrate that the Group will be able to withstand these impacts over the period of its financial forecasts. The Board has a reasonable expectation that no single or plausible combination of events would affect long-term viability, even under the severe stress tests and the Group would be able to continue operating and meet its liabilities over the three-year period. In order to reach this conclusion, the Board has considered: Possible actions to mitigate the impact of risks in the severe stress tests, including limiting or delaying discretionary capital expenditure without compromising on network quality, optimising operating expenditure and reducing or stopping dividend payments Accessing additional funding, including financing facilities and access to the debt capital markets in order to repay debt which matures over the three-year period while maintaining adequate liquidity headroom The proceeds from the Group's asset monetisation programme related to tower assets and investments in mobile money business which have been announced during the financial year 2020 21 The internal and external environment, current and long-term prospects, and the strategic intents and directions adopted by management The risk framework, potential sensitivities around the principal risks and mitigating factors The Board has concluded that the Group would be in a position to access debt capital markets and meet our financing needs, as and when required. Based on this assessment and in accordance with requirements of paragraph 31 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has concluded that we have the ability to continue our operations and be able to meet our commitments and liabilities over the assessment period.

I would like to begin this statement by saying once again how proud I am of Airtel Africa's people for the resilient approach they have taken to providing our customers with essential services despite the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. I say more about their contribution to their communities and to the performance of our business in my introduction on pages 8-9. Their efforts show our purpose, values and culture in action - transforming lives through a can-do attitude, entrepreneurial spirit and innovation. As a Board, we recognise that we have more to do to measure and report on the processes by which our culture and purpose are embedded across Airtel Africa, which will continue to be a focus for us in the next year. At the same time, we're confident that our employees are showing what our values mean on the ground, not least in the way they were able to anticipate, adapt and deliver solutions that enrich the lives of the communities we serve. Our commitment to continuous improvement and strong governance underpins our ability to deliver solutions that enrich the lives of the customers and communities we serve. Sunil Bharti Mittal Chair Governance report 88 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name:  v24 Modification Date: 25 May 2021 5:51 pm Embedding our approach, listening to stakeholders We know that both our shortand long-term performance must be built on a strong and appropriate governance structure. Alongside the Board's focus on making sure our business has the appropriate structure and quality of capital, debt and liquidity, described by our chief financial officer on page 60, we have embraced the rigorous requirements of listing in London and Lagos as part of our commitment to strong governance and transparent reporting. As part of embedding that approach, both the Board and our employees have been through a robust compliance training programme. The Board receives regular briefings and updates on corporate governance at Board and committee meetings, and has taken steps to ensure that legal and regulatory obligations become part of our culture and decision-making processes. For example, the directors' duties under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 help to underpin the good governance at the heart of how we work. We have improved our disclosure and provided better evidence on how we engage with our stakeholders, the oversight of the Board, and how feedback is considered. Details of how the Board considers shareholder and wider stakeholder interests when making decisions and strategic planning are set out on pages 32-37. Our two areas of non-compliance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code are discussed on page 91. An effective Board, with a focus on improvement Our second independent board evaluation confirmed that our Board functions effectively. It is well balanced and diverse, with a strong mix of relevant skills and experience. This evaluation took place in the context of a pandemic, where Board members were unable to meet in person. It was good to see positive ratings around the effectiveness of our virtual meetings, as well as the relationships and dynamics of the Board. With the help of the company secretary, I'five drawn up a list of action points for the Board - these include a more sustained focus on business and strategic issues, continuing to improve our engagement with stakeholders, and developing our knowledge of regional markets. The Board will also keep its composition under review, with a view to bolstering the Group's technology expertise. Related to this will be a cybersecurity deep-dive exercise conducted by our Audit and Risk Committee. While our Board is diverse, and inclusivity is one of the values of our business, we recognise that we have more to do to embed our diversity and inclusion processes at all levels. This work aligns with our new sustainability ambition, which is discussed on page 50 and outlines our approach to climate change as a strategic issue and our assessment of its potential impact on us and our stakeholders. Later this year we will announce a full set of targets and metrics to support this strategy, which has full support from the Board as a reflection of our focus on ESG issues generally and our purpose of transforming lives in particular. I'm grateful to all the members of the Board for their individual contributions, and particularly to the chairs of each committee for establishing and steering their committees during the year. The Audit and Risk, Remuneration and Nominations Committee chairs have provided their own reports on their committees' activities. In conclusion I'm confident that your Board is effective and works well. We have the right balance of skills, expertise and professionalism to continue to deliver strong governance, while allowing the CEO and CFO to implement and deliver our strategy. While I'm pleased with the Board's activities and approach when it comes to corporate governance, we continually look for ways to learn and improve. I very much look forward to meeting with shareholders at the AGM on Thursday 15 July 2021, which will be livestreamed from London. Along with all your directors who intend to be at the AGM, I'm available to respond to your questions, concerns and suggestions at any time. Sunil Bharti Mittal Chair 11 May 2021 We have improved our compliance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code applying to Airtel Africa for 2020 21. Our position on executive director shareholdings is now compliant and is explained on page 91. We remain non-compliant with Provision 9, non-independence of our chair on appointment, and Provision 41, our Remuneration Committee's engagement with our workforce - and our position is explained on page 91. The Board developed its ambition for being more sustainable. Our plans to implement and execute this ambition are explained on page 50. We have applied and improved our business model and continued with our strategic ambition to transform lives through greater financial inclusion and empowerment across the African continent by rolling out reliable network, providing affordable data and serving our customers - see page 22 for our business model and see page 24 for our strategy. We reviewed the membership of our committees and welcomed Kelly Bayer Rosmarin to our Board. We developed our strategy for improving diversity and inclusion at all levels of our business - see page 57. We enhanced our succession and contingency planning processes - see page 112. We conducted a comprehensive, externally facilitated Board evaluation - see page 97. Governance highlights for the year ended 31 March 2021 89 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 Governance report c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name:  v24 Modification Date: 25 May 2021 5:51 pm Our compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 1. Board leadership and company purpose A. An effective and entrepreneurial board Our Board is responsible for Airtel Africa's system of corporate governance. As such, directors are committed to developing and maintaining high standards of governance that reflect evolving good practice. The Board provides strategic and entrepreneurial leadership within a framework of strong governance, effective controls and an open and transparent culture: this enables opportunities and risks to be assessed and managed appropriately. Our Board also sets our strategic aims and risk appetite, makes sure we have the financial and human resources in place to meet our objectives, and monitors our compliance and performance against our targets. And finally, the Board ensures we engage effectively with all of our stakeholders and considers their views in setting our strategic priorities. Roles and responsibilities We have well-documented roles and responsibilities for directors, and a clear division of key responsibilities between our chair and CEO to help maintain a strong governance framework and the effectiveness of our Board. Our clearly defined policies, processes and procedures govern all areas of the business, and these will continue to be reviewed and refined to meet business requirements and changing market circumstances. We re-examine budgets in light of business forecasts throughout the year to make sure they are robust enough to reflect the possible impact of changing economic conditions and circumstances. We conduct regular reviews of actual results and future projections compared with the budget and prior year results, as well as with various treasury reports. We monitor any disputes that could lead to significant litigation or contractual claims at each Board meeting, with updates tabled by the company secretary. We have a Board-approved framework of delegated authority to identify and monitor individual responsibilities of senior executives. Purpose, values and strategy and alignment with culture Our Board believes that a healthy culture protects and generates value and that our employees' engagement with our values and culture will lead to the successful delivery of our strategy. It is responsible for defining our values and setting clear standards from the top. Our chair leads the way on this by ensuring our Board operates correctly and with a clear culture of its own which can be promoted to our wider operations and dealings with all stakeholders. Our CEO, with the help of the CFO and his management team, is responsible for the culture within our wider operations. To meet the challenges to maintaining our culture brought about by pandemic working restrictions, we have stayed connected to each other through regular departmental check-ins and daily online team meetings. We'five continued to build our people capability through enhancing our online learning platform for greater access, encouraging skills development through short-term assignments and exchanges between operating companies, and ensuring all employees have mandatory training in compliance areas such as our Code of Conduct, anti-bribery and corruption, and information security. Last year, we reported that we intended to include a report from our chief HR officer on culture, diversity and inclusion as a standing agenda item at future Board meetings. In 2020 21, the Board received this report via the Remuneration Committee meetings attended by our chief HR director. Doug Baillie, chair of the Remuneration Committee communicated this update in his report to the Board. This year the planned Board agenda item was superseded by Covid-19-related reporting at each meeting. We intend to include this HR report at all Board meetings from May 2021. To meet its 2020 21 objective of executing our Group purpose, values and general strategy and objectives and assessing and monitoring the As Airtel Africa plc ordinary shares have been trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange since 3 July 2019, we apply the principles and provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code the Code and explain any non-compliance. While we have a secondary listing on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, we are permitted by the NSE Listings Requirements to follow the corporate governance practices of our primary listing market in London. The UK Financial Reporting Council FRC promotes high quality corporate governance and reporting through the Code, with which all companies with a premium listing on the UK Stock Exchange must either comply in full or explain why and to what extent they do not comply. Between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, we applied the principles and complied save for two provisions of the 2018 Code provisions 9 and 41 - see page 91 for details. This section explains how we have applied the Code principles. The Board has set a clear commitment to high standards of corporate governance for the Group - and we demonstrate this commitment by the way in which we conduct business and carry out our responsibilities. Simon O'Hara Group company secretary 115 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 Governance report c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: ComplianceXwithXcode v36 Modification Date: 26 May 2021 8:09 am Our compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code continued Group's culture and promoting the alignment of culture with purpose, values and strategy, our Board: Reviewed our strategy for Board and executive-level succession planning and put into place plans for achieving this Nominations Committee. For more on this see page 110 Established Transforming Lives as our corporate purpose Continued to form strategic partnerships which support and drive forward our ambition to transform lives through greater financial inclusion and empowerment across the African continent Reinforced our commitment to achieve a more gender-balanced workforce In 2021 22, the Board will continue to ensure our resourcing - including capital, finance and people - is sufficient to achieve our strategy while continuously improving performance and diversity. While our leadership establishes our culture and leads by example, our clear policies and Code of Conduct ensure that our obligations to shareholders and other stakeholders are clearly understood and met, as described in more detail on page 32. C. Company performance and risk management Our CEO manages the Group's business in line with the strategic plan and approved risk appetite and takes responsibility for the operation of the internal control framework. Our Audit and Risk Committee oversees potential risks and provides the Board with strategic advice on current and potential future risk exposures. Our risk management framework supports informed risk-taking by our businesses, setting out the risks that we're prepared to be exposed to and the risks that we want to avoid. More information on risk management can be found on page 107 D. Stakeholder engagement Our Board members take an active role in engaging with shareholders and wider stakeholders. Our director induction process includes directors' duties under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. The Board regularly receives feedback on shareholder sentiment and sell-side analysts' views of our business and the wider industry. Our Investor Relations team and management have frequent contact with the five equity research analysts who follow Airtel Africa. In October 2020, the Remuneration Committee on behalf of the Board wrote to our top 20 investors to provide further details of how our remuneration policy was being applied in 2020 21, including details on salary increases and the difficulty of setting targets and metrics until the impact of Covid-19 was clear. Our aim is to better embed stakeholder considerations in Board decision-making, In March 2021, as part of the preparation for the launch of our sustainability strategy we consulted with our priority stakeholders: representatives from our investors, customers, partners, operating country Boards and NGOs. Our aim was to consider stakeholder concerns when developing our sustainability strategy, as advised by the Global Reporting Initiative GRI. Under the GRI framework, an organisation is required to identify its stakeholders, and explain how it has responded to their reasonable expectations and interests. Considering the input of stakeholders when creating our sustainability strategy strengthens our strategy and reporting. Our Board discusses the impact of all major decisions on our workforce before drawing its conclusion. We also consider stakeholder impact in relation to material acquisitions and strategic expansion. Factoring the needs and concerns of our stakeholders into Board discussions and decisions is in accordance with section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 see statement on page 32. Sunil Bharti Mittal is our designated Board director for employee engagement, given his regular travel to our operating companies. More on our approach to stakeholder engagement can be found on page 32 of the strategic report E. Workforce policies and practices We expect all businesses and employees to work with the highest standards of integrity and conduct at all times. Our Code of Conduct, which can be found on our website, sets out our expectations in detail. We also have policies focused on anti-bribery and corruption, whistleblowing and data protection GDPR setting out the ethical framework that all companies and employees are expected to follow. Each year, our employees receive up-to-date training on legislative and regulatory matters. Our management processes and divisions of responsibility are detailed in the following documents, which can be seen on our website: Schedule of matters reserved for Board decisions, including profit expectations and dividend policy Terms of reference for Audit and Risk, Nominations and Remuneration Committees Policies covering operational, compliance, corporate responsibility and stakeholder matters, including ones related to the Bribery Act 2010 and anti-corruption - these are updated as necessary in line with developments in corporate governance and legislation Our Articles of Association Our policies are reported against to the Board and or Audit and Risk Committee by the head of internal audit, chief compliance officer or the company secretary. A description of our whistleblowing procedures is set out on page 107. Division of responsibilities F. Role of the chair The roles and responsibilities of the chair and the CEO have been clearly defined, set out in writing and signed by Sunil Bharti Mittal and Raghu Mandava. The chair leads our Board and is responsible for its overall effectiveness in directing the company. Our chair and the senior independent director hold separate meetings at least once a year with non-executive directors without the CEO present. Each did this once during the 2020 21 reporting period. Led by the senior independent director, the non-executive directors also meet at least once during the year without the chair being present to appraise his performance. The chair also met formally with independent non-executive directors without our CEO or other non-executive directors present. Through these meetings, the chair ensures we maintain a fair and open culture where all Board members are able to make a strong contribution. The Board has concluded that Sunil Bharti Mittal did not meet the independence criteria of the Governance Code when he was appointed, due to his interests in the company. However, in light of his extensive involvement with Airtel Africa and the Bharti Airtel Group over many years, the Board has considered his major contribution to the company's growth and success and unanimously agrees that his continued involvement is crucially important to our ongoing success. The Board has a number of safeguards in place to ensure robust corporate governance during his tenure as chair, including Andrew Green in position as a strong senior independent director. The Board believes Sunil Bharti Mittal continues to effectively oversee our leadership and maintain a balanced shareholder agenda. G. Composition of the Board and division of responsibilities Our Board consists of 11 directors: non-executive chair Sunil Bharti Mittal, who is not independent, CEO Raghu Mandava, six independent non-executive directors and three non-executive directors. Andrew Green, CBE, is the senior independent director and Simon O'Hara is our Group company secretary. For more on our Board composition, see page 82. Governance report 116 Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2021 c 2021 Friend Studio Ltd File name: ComplianceXwithXcode v36 Modification Date: 26 May 2021 8:09 am The Board has an established framework of delegated financial, commercial and operational authorities which define the scope and powers of the CEO and of operational management. For more on our Board and executive roles, pages 82-87 H. Role of non-executive directors Our independent non-executive directors offer advice and guidance to the CEO and CFO, drawing on their wide experience in business and diverse backgrounds. They also provide a constructive challenge and hold management to account - monitoring the overall direction and strategy of the company, scrutinising the performance of the CEO and CFO, and ensuring the integrity of the financial information made available to the Board and our shareholders. They play an important part in general succession planning for the Board and other executive and senior management positions. The senior independent director and the independent directors also play a critical role in fulfilling the requirements of the separation governance framework and ensuring Airtel Africa's independence. Following their appointment, each of our non-executive directors both independent and non-independent received an induction that focused on the culture, operational structure and key challenges of Airtel Africa. Details of this induction are on page 113. Board processes and role of company secretary We have a range of processes in place to make sure our Board is fully informed in a timely manner to be able to meet its duties. Directors receive papers before each Board and committee meeting. This allows them to prepare for meetings and also to send in their views if they're unable to attend. The CEO also sends updates to members on important issues between meetings: and members receive a monthly report on key financial and management information, as well as regular updates on shareholder issues and analysts' notes. This information is distributed through a secure online portal. All directors have direct access to the advice and services of the company secretary, and non-executive directors are able to take independent legal advice at our expense when necessary to fulfil their duties to the company. Board appointments As part of our 2020 21 Board evaluation, we reaffirmed that each of our independent non-executive directors is independent in character and that there are no relationships which could affect their judgement. The main objective of our Nominations Committee is to ensure that we have the best possible leadership team by overseeing a formal, rigorous and transparent process for appointing and removing directors to or from the Board, our committees and other senior roles. The committee also works with the aim of improving diversity and developing our succession-planning processes. During the reporting period, Kelly Bayer Rosmarin was appointed to the Board and Awuneba Ajumogobia joined the Audit and Risk Committee. We remain non-compliant with Provision 9 - non-independence of our chair on appointment, and our position is explained on page 91. Our appointment process When considering the recruitment of new members of the Board, the Nominations Committee adopts a formal and transparent procedure which considers the skills, knowledge and level of experience required, as well as diversity. The recruitment process begins by evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of existing Board members, the diversity of the Board and the ongoing requirements and strategic developments of the business. This enables us to focus our search process on appointing a candidate who will complement and enhance the Board's effectiveness and overall performance. When necessary, the committee will use the services of a professional search firm to identify appropriate candidates. The committee will only choose firms that have adopted the voluntary code of conduct addressing gender diversity and best practice in search assignments. We retained no such firm during the reporting period. We review a long list of globally drawn potential candidates and shortlist candidates for interview based on the objective criteria set out in the agreed specification - this addresses the strategic requirements of the Group: the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of current members: and the diversity of the Board. Non-executive appointees must be able to show that they have time available to devote to the role, and before being appointed all candidates must identify any potential conflicts of interest. Shortlisted candidates are interviewed by the committee chair, other committee members and the CEO. The committee then recommends the preferred candidate, who is invited to meet other Board members. Finally, the committee takes up detailed external references before making a formal recommendation to the Board for appointment. Andy Green took on the role of chair at Gentrack Group Limited NZX ASX-listed in October 2020. No other director took on a significant new appointment during the year. Before accepting the appointment, Andy discussed with the chair and our company secretary an indication of the anticipated time commitment and agreed that he would continue to have sufficient time to give to his Airtel Africa Board duties. For more on our Nominations Committee's activities and processes, see page 110 K. Skills, experience and knowledge of the Board and its committees We have an engaged and diverse Board who reflect the cultural and ethnic diversity of the countries in which we operate. Our Board members bring a range of practical experience and deep expertise to our business - and at least half of our directors, excluding the chair, are independent non-executive directors, in line with the Code's recommendations. While not an executive director, our CFO attends all Board and Audit and Risk Committee meetings. The Board considers that each director brings relevant and complementary skills, experience and background to the Board, details of which are set out in the biographies on pages 82-84 and the Board skills matrix on page 85. L. Board evaluation As part of good governance, it's important to make sure our Board as a whole, its committees and each director is operating and performing effectively. While the Code requires an externally facilitated evaluation at least every three years, we have chosen to do this in each of the two years since our listing to enable us to plan effectively for the future. In 2020, we again engaged Linstock to facilitate this evaluation - a completely independent advisory firm specialising in Board performance reviews. All Board members and our company secretary were invited to complete an online survey on the performance of the Board, its committees and the chair, as well as their own contributions to the Board. The survey was completely anonymous to promote an open and frank exchange of views.

Audit, risk and internal control M. Independence and effectiveness of internal and external audit During 2020 21, we enhanced our control environment through a robust risk assessment and review led by our Audit and Risk Committee. This identified the key risks to be reviewed and assessed by Internal Audit as part of its programme of work during the year. During the year, a number of initiatives were undertaken by Internal Audit to ensure that it continues to meet both current good practice and the evolving needs of Airtel Africa. We introduced our new controls framework ICOFR and performed an audit needs assessment to inform our internal audit strategy. We also enhanced our internal audit risk assessment process to allow for better coverage and more dynamic audit planning. During 2020 21 Deloitte UK performed an external statutory audit of year end 31 March 2020, and a half-yearly review. See page 108 for a discussion of their independence and effectiveness. For more on the activities and processes of our Audit and Risk Committee, see pages 100-109 N. Fair, balanced and understandable assessment Pages 14-15, 22-23, 24-31 and 72-78 of the strategic report set out our performance, business model and strategy, as well as the risks and uncertainties relating to the company's future prospects. When taken as a whole, the directors consider this Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and provides information necessary for shareholders to assess our performance, business model and strategy. The directors made their assessment following the Board's review of the document at its meetings on 29 March, 7 May and 11 May 2021. Risk management, internal control and determining principal risks As highlighted in the strategy and risk sections of the strategic report, risk management is inherent to our management thinking and business planning processes. The Board has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining our risk management and internal control systems. Our Audit and Risk Committee supports the Board in reviewing the effectiveness of our internal controls, including financial, operational and compliance, as well as our risk management systems. For more on the activities and processes of this committee, see pages 100-109 5. Remuneration P. Remuneration policies and practices Our proposed policy is intended to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre directors, to promote the long-term success of Airtel Africa, and to be in line with best practice and the interests of our stakeholders. There are two key principles of our remuneration policy. One, the structure of remuneration packages and, in particular, the design of performance-based schemes, should be aligned with stakeholders' interests and support our business strategy and objectives. And two, the performance-based element of remuneration should be appropriately balanced between the achievement of short-term objectives and longer-term objectives. Our directors' remuneration policy DRP which sets out our policy for paying our CEO, chair and non-executive directors was approved by a binding shareholder vote at our 2020 AGM. Raghu Mandava is expected to reach the minimum shareholding target as soon as reasonably possible. A minimum requirement of 250% of salary will apply while he is in employment. Last year we reported non-compliance with Provision 36 which states that the Remuneration Committee should develop a formal policy or post-employment shareholding requirements encompassing both unvested and vested shares. At that time, the committee considered that, in light of the company's unusual circumstances, with senior executives located in Africa where additional requirements on the holding of shares are not market practice, the operation of bonus deferral and post-vesting holding requirements provided sufficient alignment after employment has ended. However, in response to shareholder feedback and clarifications from the FRC on compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Remuneration Committee has introduced a formal post-employment share ownership requirement. For details of our share ownership policy, see page 128 Provision 32 Remuneration Chair - prior service Doug Baillie has now served as our Remuneration Committee chair for over two years since being appointed to the Board in April 2019. The Board confirms that Doug has since displayed the skills and experience required for the role and has the full support of the Board. Accordingly, we will no longer report against this provision. Provision 41 engagement with the workforce During the year, the Remuneration Committee did not engage systematically with our people to explain how executive remuneration aligns with wider company pay policies. Procedure for developing remuneration policy In 2019 20, we thoroughly reviewed the remuneration arrangements for our directors. Our goal was to make sure our new policy would incentivise our management team to deliver longer-term shareholder value. We also wanted to make sure this reflected the latest Code requirements and was in line with UK good practice. Having consulted on with our largest shareholders who indicated their support, the policy was adopted at the 2020 AGM. R. Exercising independent judgement In the year ended 31 March 2021: Alvarez & Marsal provided remuneration advice and benchmarking data to our Remuneration Committee. Alvarez & Marsal was appointed by the committee in light of their experience and expertise in independent remuneration advisory work Clifford Chance provided legal advice in relation to share plan matters and remuneration advice to our Remuneration Committee. Clifford Chance was appointed by the committee in light of their experience and expertise in the areas of advice sought The committee uses its discretion, within the maximum policy limits, to consider the target bonus taking account of market development opportunities, specific events and evolving roles. While the committee has the discretion to change the metrics and weighting for the bonus plan from year to year, we normally consult with major shareholders before making any significant changes.

        "Detailed Analysis of ROE": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is ROE increasing or declining?**  \n  The **Return on Equity (ROE)** has increased significantly from **0.4338** in the previous year to **0.6708** in the current year, indicating a strong upward trend in profitability relative to shareholders' equity.\n\n- **Is growth in ROE higher than that of competitors and the industry?**  \n  While specific competitor and industry ROE figures are not provided in the report, the company's substantial improvement in **ROE** suggests it is outperforming typical industry growth, especially given the challenging retail environment.\n\n- **Is growth persistent or temporary?**  \n  The textual report highlights ongoing strategic investment in online infrastructure, diversification of revenue streams (e.g., Total Platform, LABEL), and strong cash flow generation. These factors point towards **persistent growth** in ROE rather than a one-off spike. However, external uncertainties like geopolitical risks and inflation pose potential risks.\n\n# Forecasts:\n- **Expected ROE next year** is likely to remain strong or moderately increase, supported by projected profit growth of around **3.3% to 8.7%** and stable capital structure, as indicated by the management\u2019s confident outlook despite economic uncertainties.\n\n# Summary:\n- The company has demonstrated a **significant increase in ROE** from **43.4% to 67.1%**, reflecting improved profitability and capital efficiency.\n- Sustained investments in **online infrastructure, diversification through Total Platform and LABEL**, and strong cash flow underpin the likelihood of **persistent ROE growth**.\n- Macroeconomic uncertainties and operational risks like inflation and geopolitical instability could temper growth, but the company\u2019s strategic adaptability and strong balance sheet provide resilience.",
        "Detailed Analysis of ROE Drivers": "# AI Analysis:\n\n- **Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?**  \n  The growth in ROE is driven by increases in both **Assets Turnover** (from **1.54** to **1.92**) and **Profit Margin** (from **8.1%** to **14.6%**). This dual improvement reflects a very good sign, indicating that the company is becoming more efficient at using its assets while simultaneously improving profitability on sales.\n\n- **Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?**  \n  While the textual report does not provide explicit competitor or industry benchmarks, the significant jump in both **Assets Turnover** and **Profit Margin** suggests that the company is likely outperforming its peers or industry averages, especially given its record high EPS and robust online sales growth. The improvement in margin to above 14% and asset turnover nearing 2 times indicates strong operational performance relative to typical retail industry standards.\n\n# Forecasts:\n\n- **Expected Asset Turnover next year:** Given the company's continued investment in automated warehouses and technology, as well as the growing online business, it is reasonable to forecast a **moderate increase or stabilization around 1.95 - 2.0**, reflecting sustained asset efficiency.\n\n- **Expected Profit Margin next year:** Despite inflationary pressures and cost increases outlined in the report, the company\u2019s focus on margin improvement and better retail performance suggests a **forecasted profit margin around 14% - 15%**, maintaining the recent gains.\n\n# Summary:\n\n- The company's **ROE growth is very well supported by simultaneous increases in both Asset Turnover (from 1.54 to 1.92) and Profit Margin (from 8.1% to 14.6%)**, indicating strong operational leverage and profitability improvements.\n- Investment in infrastructure and technology, combined with successful growth in online sales and better retail performance, are the main drivers of improved **asset efficiency and profit margins**.\n- The outlook remains positive, with **forecasted stabilization or slight improvement in Asset Turnover and Profit Margin** despite macroeconomic uncertainties, underpinning sustainable ROE expansion.",
        "Detailed Analysis of Risk": "AI Analysis:\n\n- **Are risks increasing or declining?** The financial risk has increased, as indicated by the rise in NLP financial risk from **1.81** to **2.42**. Conversely, legal and tax risks are declining, with NLP legal risk decreasing from **0.89** to **0.68** and NLP tax risk dropping significantly from **1.66** to **0.87**.\n- **Is the number and severity of risks higher than competitors/industry?** The report does not provide direct competitor benchmarks, but the increase in financial risk coupled with decreased legal and tax risks suggests a mixed risk profile. The company seems to be managing legal and tax exposures better than before, while financial risks warrant attention.\n- **Is sentiment increasing or declining?** Sentiment measures are indirectly inferred from NLP scores. The decline in legal and tax risks along with stable sentence length and depth may indicate a neutral to slightly improving sentiment regarding risk disclosures.\n- **Is specificity increasing or declining?** NLP specificity shows a slight decline from **0.1035** to **0.1023**, suggesting marginally less detailed or precise risk disclosures compared to the previous year.\n- **Are complexity measures increasing or declining?** Both NLP sentence length and sentence depth have decreased slightly (sentence length from **26.77** to **26.61**, sentence depth from **6.08** to **6.04**), indicating a minor reduction in disclosure complexity.\n- **How are sentiment, specificity, and complexity compared to competitors?** Without direct competitor data, the company\u2019s stable to slightly reduced specificity and complexity suggest a consistent but not improving disclosure quality. The improved management of non-financial risks (legal and tax) may position the company favorably in risk communication.\n\nForecasts:\n- **Is Gearing expected to increase next year?** Given the significant decrease in gearing from **4.61** to **2.89**, combined with the report's emphasis on strong cash generation and manageable net debt, **Gearing is expected to remain stable or slightly decrease, not increase.**\n- **Is Current Ratio expected to increase next year?** The current ratio improved from **1.91** to **1.99**, and with ongoing investment in infrastructure plus solid cash flow, **Current Ratio is expected to maintain or increase modestly.**\n- **Is Quick Ratio expected to increase next year?** The quick ratio declined from **0.52** to **0.39**, reflecting lower liquid asset coverage short-term. Given this trend and ongoing inventory investments, **Quick Ratio is unlikely to increase significantly next year.**\n\nSummary:\n- The company exhibits a **mixed risk profile** with increasing financial risk but declining legal and tax risks, indicating focused management on regulatory compliance.\n- **Disclosure complexity and specificity have slightly decreased**, which may affect transparency but keeps disclosures accessible.\n- Financial metrics show **improvement in gearing and current ratio**, supporting a healthier liquidity and capital structure, though quick ratio weakening suggests attention to liquid asset management is needed.\n- Overall, the company\u2019s risk disclosures and financial health reflect **a cautious but stable position**, with opportunities to enhance risk transparency and liquidity management.",
        "summary": "**Summary:**  \n- The company\u2019s **Return on Equity (ROE) increased significantly from 43.4% to 67.1%**, demonstrating strong profitability and capital efficiency improvements.  \n- ROE growth is well supported by dual drivers: **Asset Turnover rose from 1.54 to 1.92** and **Profit Margin improved from 8.1% to 14.6%**, signaling enhanced operational leverage.  \n- Sustained investments in **online infrastructure and diversified revenue streams (Total Platform, LABEL)** underpin persistent profitability gains.  \n- Financial risk has increased (**NLP financial risk from 1.81 to 2.42**), warranting close monitoring despite improvements in legal and tax risk exposures.  \n- Liquidity shows mixed signals: **Gearing sharply improved from 4.61 to 2.89** and **Current Ratio increased to 1.99**, but **Quick Ratio declined from 0.52 to 0.39**, indicating tighter short-term liquid assets.  \n- Risk disclosures show a slight decline in complexity and specificity, which may impact transparency but maintains accessibility.  \n- The company\u2019s operational and financial resilience positions it well against industry challenges, with strategic adaptability mitigating external uncertainties like inflation and geopolitical risks.  \n- **Expected ROE is forecasted to remain strong or moderately increase**, supported by projected profit growth of 3.3% to 8.7%.  \n- **Gearing is expected to remain stable or slightly decrease**, reflecting prudent capital management and strong cash flow generation.  \n- Overall, the company demonstrates a robust growth trajectory with manageable risks but should focus on enhancing liquidity and risk disclosure quality."

An analysis of our performance in 2021 22 and our outlook for the year ahead are covered in detail in the following pages but, looking back on the year, among the highlights are: Delivery of record high Earnings Per Share EPS. Growing our third-party branded business LABEL, with the addition of new brands, extending the ranges from existing partners and increasing the number of brands using the Platform Plus and Direct Dispatch operating models. We have further enhanced our branded offer through the manufacture of products under licence from partner brands. The outstanding job done by our warehouse team to keep up with servicing the growth in demand online. The better than expected performance of our Retail business, when our stores reopened in April following lockdown at the start of the year. Increasing the number of Total Platform client brands, with the recent launch of Reiss being our most ambitious and comprehensive Total Platform project to date. Significant capital investment programmes, including a highly automated warehouse and modernising our website software. Restarting dividend payments, with two special dividends paid in September 2021 and January 2022. In the year ahead we will return to our pre-pandemic ordinary dividend cycle. During the year, we were delighted to welcome Soumen Das to the Board as a non-executive director. His property knowledge, financial acumen and listed company experience have enhanced the strength and depth of the existing Board's capabilities. I am very proud to see how everyone within the business has embraced our challenges, opportunities and ambitions. I would like to thank them for this, and also for the continued commitment that they have shown over the past two years whilst having to deal with disruption to both their work and personal lives due to the pandemic. We enter 2022 with confidence in the outlook for our business and its ability to continue its successful evolution. The effects of the pandemic are ongoing and we remain mindful of macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, but our continued investment over many years in our people and our systems has generated strong and resilient results in the past year and we believe that it will continue to do so. CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW OVERVIEW We have navigated our way through the pandemic and the structural changes affecting our sector, to deliver record sales and Earnings Per Share. We acknowledge that we have been fortunate. We went into the pandemic with a well established Online business and a diverse product offer. This allowed our Online business to make up for much of the sales we lost in Retail: and accommodate the dramatic shift in sales between different product categories experienced during lockdown. But it has not all been about the pre-pandemic positioning of the Company. Colleagues across the Group have worked tirelessly and effectively to adapt our product offer and operations, as circumstances have changed. We have also added to the Group's revenues through the development of new products, services and business opportunities. As always, this report gives a detailed review of the financial performance of the constituent parts of the Group and guidance for the year ahead see Parts 4 and 5 below. In Part 2, the Big Picture, we take the opportunity to stand back from the near-term performance of the Group and explain how we think our sector is evolving and likely to change going forward. We also detail how we are adapting the organisation, and the economics of the business, to address those changes. We explain how the Buying side and Selling side of the business are gaining more independence from each other and increasingly operate as businesses in their own right. We believe this change of approach has led to a proliferation of initiatives and new ideas. STRUCTURE OF THIS REPORT The report is broken down into the following sections: PART 1: Headlines and Summary of Financial Performance, gives a quick overview of the financial performance of the Group and our guidance for the year ahead. PART 2: The Big Picture, summarises the way in which NEXT is adapting its business model in response to the deep rooted and lasting changes we perceive are at work in our sector. PART 3: Fifteen Year Stress Test, revisits our 15 year cash flow stress test for the Group. The stress test is not a forecast or a plan, but a chance for shareholders to assess the likely cash generation of the Group for a given set of assumptions about our future growth. PART 4: Financial Performance 2021 22, gives a detailed breakdown of the financial performance of the business in the reported year. This long section is mainly for the benefit of analysts and professional investors and may test the patience of those preferring a shorter read! PART 5: Outlook for The Year Ahead, gives our latest sales and profit guidance for 2022 23. A Report for Colleagues and Shareholders Alike For NEXT, the process of writing and presenting our biannual reports is an important part of how we manage the business. They are i an important discipline, which forces us to take a hard and sometimes uncomfortable look at our numbers and ii a means of clearly communicating our plans, aims and objectives to manage the business going forward. Our aim is that colleagues who read at least Parts 1 and 2 of this document will end up with a clearer view of the Company's plans, its values and the part they play in the collective endeavour. So, our reports are as important for our colleagues as they are for shareholders, and written with both audiences in mind. Year end net debt excluding lease debt of PS600m, down -46% versus 2019 20. Outlook for the Year Ahead Following the closure of our websites in Ukraine and Russia, and after moderating growth expectations in some other overseas territories, we have lowered our sales guidance for 2022 23 by PS85m -2.0% and profit guidance by PS10m -1.2% see page 59. In our new guidance, an improved outlook for UK Retail sales has mitigated the anticipated loss of lower margin sales overseas and the associated cost of increased markdown see page 61. Our central scenario for the year ahead is that full price sales will increase by 5.0% and that Group profits will increase by 3.3% to PS850m see page 61. Year end net debt 2 is forecast to rise in line with anticipated profits to PS620m, up 3.3% versus 2021 22. Earnings Per Share forecast to be 556.6p, up 4.9% versus 2021 22. For a more detailed analysis of our guidance for the year see Part Five, Outlook for the Year Ahead, on page 58. NOTES ON THE PRESENTATION OF SALES AND PROFIT Throughout this document, unless otherwise stated, comparisons of sales, profit and debt for 2021 22 will be explained relative to two years ago 2019 20. The disruption to last year 2020 21 from COVID means that one year comparisons are generally not meaningful. In the year ahead 2022 23, comparisons will revert to a one year basis 2021 22. All profit figures given are stated on an IFRS 16 basis. A full explanation of the impact of IFRS 16 is given in the Appendix on pages 65 to 70. 1 Full price sales are total sales excluding VAT, less items sold in our mid-season and end-of-season Sale events, our Clearance operations and through Total Platform. These are not statutory sales refer to Note 2 of the financial statements. 2 Net debt excludes lease liabilities. 5 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information PERFORMANCE LAST YEAR AND GUIDANCE FOR THE YEAR AHEAD 2021 22 - A Good Year Last year exceeded all our expectations. In the first quarter, during lockdown, we made up for much of the lost Retail sales through Online sales, particularly homeware and children's clothing. In the second half, despite stock shortages, we were able to scale up Online operations to meet pent-up demand for adult clothing. We believe that the second half performance was, in a large part, fuelled by the release of consumer savings accumulated during lockdown. We have launched four new clients on Total Platform, with that business delivering a year one profit of PS10m and expected to deliver circa PS20m in the year ahead see page 39. 2022 23 - Profit Guidance Moderated in an Increasingly Uncertain World The buoyancy of our sales last year, along with the benign economic environment that accompanied it, make comparatives in the year ahead challenging. Last year's strength contrasts with this year's unusually high level of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. The combination of these factors make accurate guidance particularly difficult. In our January Trading Statement we set out the reasons for taking a more cautious approach. We highlighted five big uncertainties which tempered our expectations. These were: i the unwinding of pandemic savings, ii a return to spending on travel and leisure, iii inflation in competing essential goods, iv inflation in NEXT's selling prices, and v likely increases in UK taxes and mortgage rates. At that time, we had not contemplated that a war in Ukraine might add to the cocktail of uncertainties. Weighed against these negative factors, nominal wage inflation is running at 4.8% 3 and UK employment rates remain strong. It is difficult to draw too many conclusions from sales this year in January, February and March, because our stores were shut for the entire period last year. So far this year, UK sales are ahead of where we expected them to be, mainly driven by better than anticipated sales in our Retail stores. We are also seeing a very sharp reversal of lockdown fashion trends, with a return to more formal dressing and notable reduction in spending on Home and very casual clothing. After accounting for the combination of: 1 the loss of PS18m of profit from the closure of our Ukrainian and Russian businesses and 2 better than expected sales in the UK, we are reducing our central profit guidance for the full year by PS10m to PS850m, a reduction of -1.2%. Our guidance for the year ahead is set out in detail in Part Five of this document page 58. 3 ONS: Whole Economy Year on Year Three Month Average Growth % Nov 2021 - Jan 2022: Seasonally Adjusted Total Pay Excluding Arrears, issued 15.03. 6 GROUP SALES AND PROFIT SUMMARY Brand full price sales were up 12.8% versus 2019 20 and Brand total sales 4 including markdown and Total Platform sales were up 12.1%. Profit before tax was PS823m, which was up 10% versus 2019 20. TOTAL SALES BY DIVISION TOTAL SALES VAT EX. The difference in the respective growth of Total Sales and Statutory sales is explained in the Appendix. 5 Profit by division in January 2021 and 2020 is re-stated for IFRS 16. A full explanation of the impact of IFRS 16 is given in the Appendix on page 65. 6 The interest charged to NEXT Finance in January 2021 has been restated from PS48.4m to PS33.7m to take account of a change in the method used to calculate an internal interest rate see page 44. This cost is an internal recharge only and the restatement has no impact on Group profit. 7 Other includes Franchise, Lipsy and other Group costs see page 50. 7 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information PART TWO BIG PICTURE SEA CHANGE The pandemic accelerated the transformation of our industry, delivering in a couple of years, changes we expected to take five or more. As we emerge from the pandemic, and despite the political and economic uncertainties, the future shape of our industry is becoming clearer. Three related factors appear central to the way in which our industry is changing, namely: An Abundance of Choice The change to our industry is more profound than a simple shift from high street stores to shopping online. The internet has served to dramatically increase shoppers' choices: bringing consumers more designs, more brands, more colours, more sizes and broader price ranges. So today, consumers in even the remotest parts of the UK can enjoy a choice of products that would put to shame the very best of the world's high streets in the early 2000's. The Growth of Online Aggregators In the last five years the competitive environment has changed beyond recognition. Online aggregators, websites that sell many different third-party brands, have become increasingly important ASOS, Zalando, Tmall, Myntra, and many others, including NEXT : while many businesses, that seemed part of an immutable retail landscape, have all but disappeared. New World for New Brands It has never been less expensive or faster to set up and roll out a new brand. Gone are the days when new brands needed to spend decades developing a store network. Today, brands can deliver their own fully functioning website, with national reach, in a matter of months albeit the complexity and cost of website functionality are rising rapidly. More importantly, online aggregators can enable new brands to gain access to millions of customers worldwide and overnight. As time goes on, it appears likely that there will be a greater number of brands, with wider geographical reach, served by a smaller number of aggregators. In this environment our aim is clear: i to extend the NEXT Brand's breadth of offer and international reach and ii strive to build an aggregation business that is the natural first choice for fashion, homeware and beauty customers in the UK and Eire. 8 Opportunities and Threats in an Internet Age A world in which new brands can rapidly gain scale presents a threat to large, well established brands like NEXT. Particularly those, like us, who have grown market share through building a large store network. But the possibilities of the internet age present the Group with far more opportunities than threats. NEXT product ranges, liberated from the constraints of finite retail space, can offer far more choice to our customers. And if new and developing brands are going to gain scale at pace, we can enable that process through our own Online aggregation business and through passing on the value of our Online infrastructure and Technology through Total Platform. Finally, in overseas markets, where we have struggled to gain traction, the internet has enabled us to break into new markets, challenging the incumbents in those territories. ORGANISING OURSELVES TO MEET THE CHALLENGE With so much going on, it is an exciting time to work at NEXT. It is hard to think of a time when there were more opportunities. But with so many new products, new businesses, new international markets, new partnerships, and with so many of those opportunities reliant on the delivery of new infrastructure and software, there is a risk that the business might lose focus. We think there are two main risks: The Organisation Risk: The risk that the individuals working within the organisation lose a sense of their part in the endeavour and how their work and ideas can make a difference. The Profitability Risk: There is a risk, in our enthusiasm to build new business ideas, we overlook or miscalculate the profitability of the individual activities that we are undertaking. The following section describes: How we have adapted our business model to keep things simple. Some of the major initiatives we are undertaking in the year ahead. The way in which we think about the profitability and returns of the activities we undertake. For clarity, this is not the announcement of a new management structure or reorganisation! It is a description of how the organisation has evolved and is evolving into a very different business model. 9 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information THE INCREASING INDEPENDENCE OF BUYING AND SELLING This section explains how we have already changed, and continue to change, the way in which we organise the Group. The more clearly we describe our business, and the better we explain how we create value, the more likely we are to succeed. Historic Model We have been accustomed to thinking about the component activities in our Online business being part of a seamless whole - from product sourcing through to marketing and operations. Operational departments such as Warehousing and Technology have tended to think of themselves as 'support' functions. Evolving Model As the sales of third-party brands through our website increases, the marketing and operations side of our business feels more like an independent business in its own right. In some ways, the NEXT brand has become the biggest and most important client of our own aggregation business. This increasing independence leaves the Buying Side more focused on the creation of product and brand building, and the Selling Side focused on extending and curating the range of brands we sell, building our customer base, serving customers, building infrastructure and critically developing new software. 10 THE BUYING SIDE A FOCUS ON PRODUCT AND BRAND The Buying side of our business focuses on the creative process of developing new products: design, sourcing, quality control, buying, pricing and stock management. These tasks go hand in hand with the promotion of our most valuable asset, the NEXT Brand, through photography and other brand marketing. This part of the business is mainly driven by our Product Teams and Sourcing business NEXT Sourcing. INCREASING CHOICE WITHIN THE NEXT BRAND An Explosion of Choice and Creativity The internet has enabled our buying teams to stretch their ranges far beyond the constraints imposed by the limited display space in our stores. The table below shows the extent to which we have increased choice within the NEXT Brand over the last five years. In the year ahead, we aim to further increase the diversity of the design, price, fabrics, prints, sizes and customer types within our ranges. 2022 2017 Var % NEXT Fashion Options 42,900 13,200 225% NEXT Home Options 8 15,400 9,700 59% TOTAL NEXT Options 58,300 22,900 155% New Categories We continue to extend our ranges into new and developing categories: some examples include: Men's, Women's and Children's performance sports clothing and footwear. \"Outdoor\" weather-proof clothing and footwear. Collaborations Collaborations have allowed us to stretch our own design capabilities through working with external sources of design excellence, using their fabrics, prints and motifs within clothing and homeware ranges. We have enjoyed success working in this way with heritage brands like Morris & Co through to popular entertainment licences such as Disney characters. Morris & Co. 2022 Ranges c Disney 8 In our January 2021 Full Year Results, NEXT Home options of 17,000 included some third-party branded options which have now been reclassified as LABEL. 11 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information NEXT as Licensor In product categories where we feel our design skills are relevant, but we do not have the sourcing and technical capabilities to create our own ranges, we are looking to license our designs and brand name to third-party specialist companies. Examples of upcoming opportunities are: Paint launch April 2022 Wallpaper launch April 2022 Ski wear launch October 2022 The stock risk is taken by the licensee and, if these products are sold through other retailers, we earn a royalty on sales. If the items are sold through our own channels we charge our normal LABEL commission in addition to the royalty on sales. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT BEYOND THE NEXT BRAND Third-Party Brand Licences Our licensing business creates value by combining NEXT's sourcing and quality expertise with the design inspiration of partner brands, such as the childrenswear range 'Baker' by Ted Baker. We have focused on areas which require technical expertise and specialist factories. In clothing, we are working with partners in the following areas: childrenswear, swimwear, lingerie, nightwear, shoes and men's tailoring. In Home, areas include upholstery, furniture, lighting, curtains, bedding and children's bedroom furniture and accessories. This licensing business generated sales of c. PS40m last year see page 38 for details. In the year ahead we have the opportunity to broaden and deepen our relationships with third-party licensors, and estimate we can grow sales to around PS60m. Potential areas of opportunity include: Children's sportswear. New Wholly Owned Brands We have identified some opportunities within the market, which do not sit naturally within the NEXT brand. In these areas we are experimenting with the development of new wholly owned brands. These include: Love and Roses Boutique inspired print & design, accessible prices developed by Lipsy. Friends Like These Trend led, affordable women's fashion developed by Lipsy. WOAH High quality vegan skin care developed by NEXT Home. OWN DENIM Young fashion women's jeans developed by NEXT Womenswear. There are some early signs of success, but these concepts are all at the development stage, and we have yet to fully understand the scale of opportunity in each area. Franchising Overseas Brands The Total Platform partnerships we agreed with Victoria's Secret and GAP gave us a share in their UK and Eire franchises. So, in addition to operating their websites and stores in the UK and Eire, we have also secured a comprehensive offer of their products on our website. We have recently concluded a long term agreement with Bath & Body Works BBW, the American personal care and beauty brand, for their UK and Eire franchise. This will involve hosting the BBW website in the UK, selling their product ranges on the NEXT website and opening a small number of concessions within larger NEXT stores. We are actively looking for other opportunities to maximise the potential of other iconic international brands in our home market. 12 MANAGING INCREASING CHOICE There are practical limits to the amount of choice we offer. There is a risk that too much choice will duplicate existing products, confuse our customers and stretch limited warehouse capacities. To manage this risk we are ensuring that: Buying teams only add new options that genuinely offer something different to customers. Our website search and navigation works as hard as possible to get customers to the product they want to buy. Our warehouse can manage a larger quantity of low volume lines. To that end, we are developing new infrastructure and software specifically designed to store and pick low volume lines. 13 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information THE SELLING SIDE The Selling side of the business focuses on aggregation, technology and infrastructure. This is the process of: Curating and building the branded product offer. Marketing to attract, retain and maximise sales to customers through advertising, promotion and the optimisation of the website. The development of increasingly complex and expensive infrastructure and technology websites, warehousing, call centres, distribution networks, software, data etc.. At NEXT these activities correspond to our LABEL and Total Platform businesses, and are the focus of our LABEL buying team, E-Commerce, Warehousing, Distribution, Retail and Technology teams. THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR THIRD-PARTY BRANDED BUSINESS Our Branded business, LABEL, which sells third-party brands through the NEXT website, has had a very successful year. Total LABEL sales including markdown sales grew by 69% over the last two years to PS865m. For detailed analysis and numbers see page 37. There are still many opportunities to develop and improve the LABEL business. The priorities are set out in the following paragraphs. Improved Service for Client Brands There is room to improve the service we provide to our client brands. The biggest opportunity is to make interaction with our systems easier for third-parties. In particular, making the process of getting our clients' products onto our website with as little administrative hassle as possible. We also aim to improve the quality and timeliness of the information we provide to our clients. We remain focused on the process of improving our clients' profitability through our site and to that end, this year we lowered our standard commission rate on fashion brands by 1%. Improved Brands Offer Through Platform Plus Platform Plus enables us to sell items stocked in our clients' warehouses to our customers on a twoday delivery promise. Items are collected daily from our partners' warehouses, consolidated with other items in the same order, and delivered through our own network, enabling us to take end-toend ownership of our delivery service. During the year, we extended the functionality of Platform Plus to allow us to predict future sales and pre-emptively order non-stocked items. In this way Platform Plus begins to tailor our offer to meet future demand. This development opens up the possibility of working on very thin initial stock levels for higher priced products: a development we think may be important for our ability to attract more premium clients to our website. Last year we extended our Platform Plus service to an additional 60 client brands, adding 30,000 items to our website. We aim to extend this service to a further 40 clients in the year ahead. 14 Improved Direct Dispatch Offer from Home Suppliers For very large items, such as furniture, that are unlikely to consolidate with other items, it makes sense to dispatch the goods from our partners' warehouses directly to our customers. The problem with direct dispatch is that it takes control of the delivery process and problem resolution out of our hands. To address this issue we have developed NEXT-Direct-Dispatch NDD. This service allows items to be delivered from our clients' warehouses through NEXT's nominated two-man carrier, giving us control over service and generally reducing delivery costs. 20% of our large direct dispatch items now travel through NDD and we aim to increase this to 90% in the year ahead. Welcoming New Brands to Our Website We are planning to add more third-party brands to our website in the year ahead, with the largest increase expected to come from Home brands. In fashion, we aim to increase our offer of premium brands through the Designer Boutique section of our website. 15 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information EVOLVING ECONOMICS OF THE GROUP This section starts by analysing and explaining the profitability of Total Platform and then sets out the insight that gives into the profitability of the NEXT Product and LABEL sides of our business. TOTAL PLATFORM PROFITABILITY Total Platform TP takes the separation of our business one step further. It allows third-party brands to directly access our infrastructure and to have their websites fully serviced by NEXT. Total Platform aims to give clients access to the PS1.5bn that NEXT has invested in warehousing, distribution, call centres, returns processing and software over the last 15 years. Total Platform Profitability Our target margin for Total Platform is 5% - 7% of the value of the sales it handles Gross Transaction Value or GTV. This margin is determined so that it is: Low enough to give clients a meaningful cost saving when they transition to the new service. High enough to maintain an appropriate return on capital invested we aim for 20%. In some ways, expressing Total Platform margin as a percentage of GTV is misleading. Total Platform's margin opportunity is driven by the size of the client's operating costs, not their sales. And, the return we make on our commission is a better gauge of the return we make on our activity and investments than the margin expressed as a percentage of client sales. This is best demonstrated by showing how margins on GTV and commission vary for two different clients. In the table below, Client 1, with relatively low operating costs, delivers a low margin on GTV but achieves a higher margin on the commission. Clearly we would be over-profiting if we charged this client the same percentage of GTV as Client 2. It is important to stress that neither client is preferable to the other because they both make a healthy return on the activity we undertake. Total Platform TP examples Client 1 Low operating costs Client 2 High operating costs Client sales indexed 100 100 Example TP commission 15 27 Example TP operating costs - 11 - 21 Total Platform net margin 4 6 TP margin on GTV 4% 6% TP margin on commission 27% 22% 16 LABEL PROFITABILITY In effect, LABEL provides all of the services delivered by Total Platform. So why in the year ahead are we forecasting for LABEL to earn 14% on sales rather than the 5% forecast for Total Platform? The answer is that LABEL, in addition to making Total Platform's infrastructure profit of 5%, makes a 9% 'Aggregation Profit'. This Aggregation Profit has two components: The Customer base profit: LABEL gives client brands access to NEXT's 8.2m Online customer base. In effect, LABEL makes a return on many years of investment spent building the NEXT customer base and reputation. The Aggregation profit: LABEL takes a share of the operational savings it generates through collating items from different brands into one transaction. NEXT PRODUCT PROFITABILITY NEXT branded products sold on our own website in the UK make around 21% net margin based on our forecast for 2022 23. If you reverse out the profit in infrastructure of 5%, you arrive at a 'Product Profit' of 16%. This equates to the profit the NEXT Brand business would make if it were to contract out all of its operations to Total Platform. There is a question as to whether we should treat the NEXT brand as a Total Platform client or LABEL client. Our view is that the NEXT brand is more like a Total Platform customer, because the website is branded NEXT and the brand attracts many of the customers. Interestingly, in overseas markets, where we sell on other aggregator sites, our profitability drops to between 7% and 10%, equivalent to the difference between the 21% 'Product Profit' and the 14% LABEL profit. 17 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information MARGIN, RISK AND RETURNS Differing Risk and Reward Profiles Comparing the Buying side of the business NEXT Product with the selling sides of the business LABEL and Total Platform, two quite different types of investment profile emerge in terms of margin, return on capital and risk. As explained in the paragraph below: The Buying Side The Buying side of the business requires very little capital once it 'contracts out' its infrastructure and technology to the Selling side. The vast majority of capital required is tied up in stock and some of this working capital is financed by suppliers. So the Buying side of the business makes high margins and high returns on capital. BUT fashion is a high risk business, so it requires high returns. It is subject to the vagaries of consumer preferences and buying decisions which can, every so often, be wrong. The large number of fashion businesses that have disappeared over the years are testament to these risks. The Selling Side The Selling side LABEL and Total Platform is capital intensive and lower margin, but much lower risk. This is because it is able to spread the risk of fashion volatility across many different brands and product categories. So this side of the business does not require the margins or returns that the higher risk Buying side demands. Neither Side a 'Better' Investment The important point here is that neither side of the business is necessarily a 'better' investment for the Group than the other. As long as the margins and returns on both sides are maintained at levels commensurate with risk, both are equally good investments. That is important, because it means that the Group, which is not capital constrained, can focus on maximising the potential of both sides of the business. And as long as the financial foundations of both sides are strong, the overall economics of the Group will take care of itself, whatever mix of business materialises in the long run. Having spent time explaining how the two sides of our business are gaining more independence from each other, it would not be unreasonable to ask if there is any logic in complete separation. We think, on balance, the cost and disruption of splitting the Company would far outweigh the value of this exercise for three reasons: There is an important piece of organisational logic to our current structure: the mutual selfinterest of each business owning a part of the other improves the relationship between the client Buyer and the Selling service provider. This logic is one of the main reasons we have started to acquire equity stakes in Total Platform clients. At this stage in the Company's development, the separation would do little to change the way either side was managed. There is a natural financial symbiosis between the two sides of the business. The riskier Buying side generates cash and the lower risk Selling side provides a good place to invest that cash along with the financial stability it provides to the Group. 19 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information BIG PICTURE SUMMARY A Bigger But Simpler Organisation In a rapidly changing world we have steadily changed the way we think about our business activities. We are evolving into two increasingly independent, but complementary, sides of the business - a Selling and a Buying side. Businesses that require very different skill sets and with very different underlying economics. The increasing independence of both sides of the business has two very positive effects: It is generating higher levels of innovation and generating new business ideas across the Group. It has given colleagues a clearer sense of where they fit into the Group and how their decisions, creativity and actions translate directly into the success of their business. A Clear Understanding of Where and How We Make Money The examination of the underlying economics of each side of the business explains how the various activities we undertake create value for our customers and clients. It also gives an understanding of the risks and returns involved. The aim is to ensure that the economic foundations of the business are sound and, that no matter where we can achieve growth, it will fulfil the Company's primary objective of delivering long term, sustainable growth in Earnings Per Share. Evolution not Strategy The evolution of the Group might, in hindsight, appear to have been part of a grand strategic plan. In reality, the way in which we have changed has been tactical - lots of individual initiatives taken in response to the opportunities and threats of a rapidly changing market. Our business 'model' was not conceived in the Boardroom, but is the result of countless ideas conceived at every level of the organisation. It is an important distinction, because businesses that are the sum total of their initiatives and values are those that best harness the creative intelligence and energy of all their people. 20 SUMMARY OF OBJECTIVES FOR THE YEAR AHEAD Stepping back from the bigger picture, our business objectives for the year ahead can be summarised in the following five points: NEXT PRODUCT BUYING: Make use of the almost infinite space available online to extend our product offer into new categories, increase the diversity of our designs and customer base, stretch our price architectures and improve the breadth of sizes we offer see page 11. SELLING NEXT BRAND OVERSEAS: Extend the reach of the NEXT brand overseas, through a combination of trading our own websites and through the development of our relationships with existing and new overseas aggregators. We will also investigate the possibility of licensing the production of NEXT product in territories where the barriers to entry make direct access difficult. GROWING LABEL: Continue to strengthen and broaden the offer of third-party brands sitting alongside NEXT on LABEL, our own aggregation business see page 37. This continues to be achieved through the addition of new brands and through the targeted extension of the ranges available from our existing client brands. DEVELOPING TOTAL PLATFORM: Leverage our Online infrastructure through Total Platform. The aim is to provide clothing and homeware brands with everything they need to trade online: from website and warehousing through to data security and returns handling, all paid for by a simple commission charged as a percentage of sales. This business, in conjunction with the equity stakes taken in some Total Platform partners, has made good progress during the year and its various business models are beginning to take shape see page 39. DEFENDING NEXT RETAIL: Defend the profitability of our store network through the renegotiation of rents or closure, as and when lease terms end see page 48. To achieve all these aims we need to continue to increase the capabilities of our Technology and Warehousing infrastructure. To that end we have significantly increased our focus and expenditure in these areas see page 56. 21 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information PART THREE FIFTEEN YEAR STRESS TEST SUMMARY OF 2022 STRESS TEST OUTPUT This 15 year Stress Test is the second version of a forward-looking scenario we first published in our annual report, January 2019. It assesses the impact of the continued growth of our Online and Finance businesses alongside a prolonged decline in like-for-like Retail sales. Based on the assumptions detailed below, the model estimates cash generation 9 over the next 15 years will be PS14.7bn. This compares to cash generation of PS12.3bn in the 2019 model. Performance since the last model Our actual performance in the year ending January 2022 was better than the 2019 model anticipated as set out in the table below. 2019 Model prediction for Year End Jan 2022 Pre-IFRS 16 Actual Performance for Year End Jan 2022 Post-IFRS 16 Var % Sales PS4.3bn PS4.8bn 10% Profit Before Tax PS735m PS823m 10 12% No Account Taken for Potential Growth in Cash Flows from Total Platform In the stress test, we have not modelled any growth in our Total Platform business. This is because the business is still relatively immature, and any growth assumptions would be impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy. A comprehensive update on Total Platform and how this business is developing is given on page 39. A Scenario - Not a Plan, Guidance or Forecast It is not a plan or a forecast. It is a scenario which demonstrates that, using a reasonable set of sales and cost assumptions, the underlying economics of the Group are healthy and the Company is likely to remain strongly cash generative for the foreseeable future. 9 Cash generation is pre-tax and pre-shareholder distributions, but after capital expenditure and funding the increase in Online debtors. 10 The comparison is somewhat flattered by the switch to IFRS 16 reporting, which adds approximately PS10m to the figure we would have reported under the pre-IFRS 16 accounting. 22 Summary 2022 Versus 2019 Model Inputs and Outputs The assumptions about the compound annual growth rates CAGR for each constituent part of our Online business have reduced in the 2022 model compared to 2019, the decline in Retail like-forlike sales has remained the same. However, because the Online business is a much larger part of the Group in 2022, the Total CAGR for the Group has increased in the new model.

Readers who are already familiar with the 2019 model, or who do not require as much detail, should skip the rest of this section and go to the beginning of Part 4, on page 31. 11 Online margins are maintained in line with margins expected in our guidance for 2022 23, although we anticipate that Online Overseas margins will increase from 10% to c. 12% once parcel surcharges begin to unwind post-COVID. 23 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information How the Model Works This model gives the possible performance of the NEXT Group over the next 15 years in terms of sales and cash flow. It seeks to model the financial consequences of continuing Online growth alongside a -10% fall in Retail like-for-like sales. This is set alongside the continued growth of our Online business in the UK and overseas. The model is set out in four steps, each of which is explained in turn: Step 1: Retail sales and costs walk forward Step 2: Projected Retail cash flows Step 3: Adding Online cash flows Step 4: Combined Group cash flows Step 1: Retail Sales and Costs Walk Forward Retail Sales Assumptions For the year ahead, we have assumed that we will achieve our sales and profit guidance as set out on page 59. We have then assumed that like-for-like Retail sales decline at -10% per annum from 2023 24 onwards. On a store by store basis we have assumed that this decline is mitigated by some transfer of trade from other store closures. Retail Closure Assumptions We have assumed that we will close a store once it gets close to making a net loss at branch level store cash profit before central overheads. At lease renewal we have assumed the following outcomes: Store profitability Assumed outcome at lease renewal Profitability 20% Renew for 5 years at market rent Profitability 15% and 20% Renew for 3 years at market rent Profitability 4% and 15% Hold over at passing rent Profitability 4% Close When stores are held over at passing rent, the retailer carries on paying the historic rent or in some cases lower and both landlord and tenant have the right to terminate the lease after a short notice period. 24 Transfer of Retail Trade on Closure - Assumptions When we close stores we tend to see some of their sales migrate to other nearby NEXT shops. We observe an average transfer of trade from closing stores of around 25%. Unsurprisingly, this number corresponds to the levels of cannibalisation we usually observe when opening new stores. The model accounts for transfer of trade on a store by store basis depending on the number and proximity of other local stores. The table below sets out the level of sales transfer we anticipate in different circumstances. For example, if there is only one store within five miles, we have assumed a Retail sales transfer of 20%. For clarity, if there is a store within five miles and another within ten miles, we have made the simple assumption that all the 20% transfer goes to the nearest store and none to the farther one. Transfer of trade assumptions 12 Sales transfer % 2 Stores within 5 miles 25% 1 Store within 5 miles 20% 1 Store within 10 miles 10% No Stores within 10 miles 0% We have not assumed any transfer of trade from Retail to Online when a store closes, we have assumed that 50% of store collections are transferred to stores within 10 miles and that the balance of collections switch to being delivered to home. This last assumption may be optimistic and in reality, some sales might be lost if customers are unable to collect and return their goods in local stores. This issue is addressed by altering the model to keep some loss--making stores open in order to service Online orders and returns page 27. Retail Rent Assumptions We have assumed that during the term of any lease the rents will not come down. Understandably, landlords will not unilaterally agree to a rent reduction until a lease expires or a break clause is exercisable. However, at lease break we are currently experiencing significant rent reductions where we are able to agree a new lease. Last year we agreed rent reductions of -44% in the stores where we agreed a new lease and we expect similar rent reductions on renewals agreed in the year ahead, with new lease terms averaging around 2.8 years page 48. We have prudently assumed that today's market rent i. e. the rent which could be achieved for a new lease is 25% lower than the rent we are currently locked into for all leases more than three years old. We have further assumed that, in an environment of -10% decline in like-for-like sales, market rents would continue to decline by a further -5% per annum after 2026. The table below shows how the implied market rent would vary for a store indexed to a current rate of 100. 25 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Where we have renewed leases in the model, we have assumed that a store's rent will move to its market rent as calculated by the table above upon renewal. At first sight the anticipated falls in rent towards the outer years of the model look aggressive, but remember they are based on the assumption that like-for-like sales continue to fall at -10%. If sales reductions ease, then so should the decline in rent. A Note on Turnover or Total Occupancy TOC Leases Stores that are currently on a turnover rent or TOC lease, are assumed to stay on these terms until the rent paid to the landlord falls below PS8 per square foot. Below this level, we assume that the store would close. We have set this level as a proxy for the rates liability of the store: a point at which we anticipate that the landlord would terminate the lease and seek an alternative tenant or use. Rates Assumptions Rates have been modelled to fall in line with rents based on rates revaluations in the financial years ending January 2024, 2027, 2030 and 2033. The decline in rates is modelled subject to existing rules on transition relief and would be phased in over the period up to the next rates revaluation. We have assumed no change to Uniform Business Rates. Retail Wage Cost Assumptions Wages are assumed to decline broadly in line with sales. It has been assumed that twenty percent of the store wage bill will remain fixed for example management cover and the minimum number of people required to open a store safely. So, the model assumes that 80% of wages will decline in line with sales. The high level of variability is made possible by the fact that increasing numbers of storebased staff are required to handle Online collections and returns. Central Overheads Most of our central overheads are shared between Online and Retail. Our buying, quality, sourcing, finance and HR serve both businesses. It is assumed that these costs are divided between the businesses in proportion to their turnover. So, as long as our total sales move forward, these costs will come down in our Retail business in direct proportion to sales declines. 26 Step 2: Projected Retail Cash Flows Preliminary Output, Store Numbers and Cash Flows The left-hand graph below shows the cash flow from our branches by year for the next 15 years after accounting for closures, transfer of trade and reductions in rent, rates and other costs. In year fifteen, 135 stores remain and cumulative cash outflow from the branches over the period isPS45m. In the final year the model assumes that the Retail business will make aPS25m cash loss. It can be seen from the model that whilst 15 years of -10% like-for-like sales declines in our stores is uncomfortable, the Retail business does not represent a significant financial burden or hindrance to the Group. In fact, it provides a network of stores that remain important to Online sales. a Cash flows assuming closure of all loss-making stores b Cash flows with 195 stores retained for Online services The Effect of Keeping 195 Stores Open to Service Online Sales The projected reduction in stores poses a potential threat to Online sales, as we would lose many of our NEXT operated Online collection and return locations. So, we have assumed that we would keep open a further 195 loss-making Retail stores in order to maintain Online store services in key locations. This takes the store numbers up from 135 to 330 and ensures that we maintain coverage at c. 90% of 2021's collection volumes. The cost of carrying these stores is an additionalPS35m cash loss per annum in the final year. This represents 0.4% of Online's turnover in 2037, which we believe would be a reasonable cost for the Online business for the use of the 330 store network. In reality, we would probably relocate these stores to smaller less expensive collection shops with a very limited retail offer, but for the purposes of this model we have simply accepted the PS35m cost. The Retail cash flows, adjusting for the cost of carrying loss making stores, is set out in the right-hand graphic above. As can be seen the cumulative cash flow has fallen byPS185m toPS230m. 27 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Step 3: Adding Online Cash Flows This section combines the Retail cash flow scenario with a projection of what might happen to Online sales and cash flows in the period. The assumptions used and cash flow impact are set out in the paragraphs below. Online Sales Growth Assumptions The model sets out the likely financial performance of the Group if current sales trends continue, namely: The continued growth in Online sales of NEXT branded goods in the UK. The continued growth in the sales of our third-party branded business, LABEL. The continued growth of our overseas Online business. The table below sets out the annual sales growth modelled for each year for each constituent part of the business over the next 15 years. The UK Retail line shows the decline of total sales including the effect of closures and transfer of trade. The last column gives the effective CAGR over the 15 year period. 28 Online Cost Assumptions We have taken a much simpler approach to modelling Online costs and have assumed no economies of scale as Online sales grow. We have maintained the net margins of each channel within the Online business, as set out in the table below, with the exception of Online Overseas. Overseas margin is forecast at 10% for 2022 23 but we expect this to increase to c. 12%, when freight surcharges for parcel deliveries overseas reduce, so we have modelled 12% for future years. Online channel Net margin % after all central and fixed costs UK NEXT Online 21.0% UK LABEL 13.6% Overseas 12.0% Compared to the previous model, we have reduced our margin expectations for our LABEL and Overseas businesses. In LABEL this is as a result of us lowering our standard partner commission rate by 3% during the last three years, which is part of our objective to be our partners' most profitable route to market. In our Overseas business, we have reduced our margin expectations mainly due to 1 a higher sales mix from lower margin overseas aggregators, 2 increase in customs clearance and administration fees and 3 increased delivery charges. NEXT Finance We have assumed a compound annual growth rate of 3.1% in our consumer debt, which is c. 60% of the 5.3% growth we are modelling for our UK Online business. The customer receivables balance would increase by c. PS680m over the 15 year period. We expect the return on capital employed after funding costs to be around 12.5%. Net Debt and Funding NEXT Finance Customer Receivables We have assumed that net debt excluding lease liabilities will increase in line with the growth in profit before tax, so net debt at the end of the 15 year period would be PS1.0bn. The increase in net debt PS0.4bn will fund approximately two thirds of the increase in customer receivables. Total Platform We have not assumed any future growth in the Total Platform business, because the business is still in its early stages of development and any growth assumptions would be speculative in terms of the number, size and timing of any new clients. Each year across the 15 year period assumes PS20m of profit, in line with our guidance for 2022 23. Group Capital Expenditure Annual capital expenditure has increased from an average of PS110m in January 2019's model to PS160m. This reflects increased investment in Online infrastructure and technology, with the addition of new warehouse capacity when the level of sales means that we have to increase our capacity. 29 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Step 4: Combined Group Cash Flows In summary, annual declines of -10% in like-for-like sales in our Retail business, combined with a CAGR of 6.4% in our Online business looks likely to deliver cash 13 generation of PS14.7bn over the next 15 years, with cash generation in the final year being in the order of PS1.4bn. The chart below sets out the output of the model by year. STRESS TEST CONCLUSION In summary, if the Company is able to grow top line sales by 4.1% per annum, with what we believe is a reasonable set of growth and cost assumptions, cash generation over the next 15 years would be PS14.7bn. In these circumstances we believe the model points to the underlying strength of the Group's economics and leaves us in a position where we will have the financial resources to continue to take advantage of the opportunities presented in a rapidly changing environment. Overall cash generation is PS2.4bn higher than our previous model. This increase is because: 1 growth in our Online business accelerated in the last two years and 2 we are looking at a 15 year period that has moved on by three years replacing three years of lower cash generation in the early years with three years of high cash generation at the end of the 15-year period. It is important to re-emphasise that this is a scenario based model and not a forecast, plan or guidance. Of course, ultimately, the success or failure of the Group will depend on our ability to execute well. So this scenario does not in any way guarantee success, but it does provide the foundations upon which success might be built. 13 Cash before tax and distributions.

Profit before tax was PS823m, which was up 10.0% versus 2019 20. Statutory sales growth is lower than our Brand total sales growth of 12.1% due to the high level of growth in our commission based sales through LABEL see page 37 and Total Platform see page 40. Within Brand total sales, we report the gross transaction value which includes the sale of stock we do not own and sell on commission. On a statutory basis, the reported revenue is only the commission earned by NEXT. 14 Total sales are VAT exclusive sales including the full value of commission based sales refer to Note 2 of the financial statements. 31 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information BRAND FULL PRICE SALES PERFORMANCE BY QUARTER Full price sales were down in the first quarter, when most of our Retail stores were closed for ten weeks, but sales recovered strongly post-lockdown and remained strong for the rest of the year. 16 The interest charged to NEXT Finance in January 2021 has been restated from PS48.4m to PS33.7m to take account of a change in the method used to calculate an internal interest rate see page 44. 17 Other includes Franchise, Lipsy and other Group costs see page 50. 32 NEXT ONLINE FULL PRICE SALES BY DIVISION In the year, full price sales were up 47% versus two years ago.

At that time, the initial results looked promising and six months later, retention rates look strong amongst the cohorts recruited during 2020. The table below summarises the 3.9m customers we recruited between February 2020 and April 2021, compared with the 2.4m customers recruited between February 2018 and April 2019. Comparing these two cohorts, we have seen a 12% higher retention rate and customers, on average, have spent 14% more. Looking at the cohort recruited between February 2021 and April 2021, it looks like retention rates are now returning to more normal levels. 2020 21 Recruitment Feb 20 - April 20 May - July Aug - Oct Nov - Jan Feb 21 - April 21 TOTAL Customers recruited 369k 761k 749k 1,431k 584k 3,894k 59% Still active in March 2022 100k 202k 202k 350k 130k 984k 79% Retention rate 27% 27% 27% 24% 22% 25.3% 12% Average spend to date PS231 PS221 PS200 PS145 PS133 PS177 14% 2018 19 Recruitment Feb 18 - April 18 May - July Aug - Oct Nov - Jan Feb 19 - April 19 TOTAL Customers recruited 436k 451k 496k 806k 255k 2,444k Still active in March 2020 93k 100k 115k 183k 60k 551k Retention rate 21% 22% 23% 23% 24% 22.5% Average spend to date PS198 PS178 PS167 PS120 PS131 PS155 18 Note - sales per customer given in January 2021's Year End Results were based on total sales inc. markdown. 34 ONLINE PROFIT AND NET MARGIN Online Margin Analysis Online margin for the year to January 2022 was 19.0% versus 19.1% two years ago. The margin impact of major cost categories is shown below. Net margin on total sales to January 2020 19.1% Bought-in gross margin Higher unplanned inbound freight costs in the second half reduced margin in the year by -0.8%. The higher sales participation of lower margin LABEL, Total Platform and Overseas sales reduced bought-in margin by -2.1%. - 2.9% Lower surplus Surplus stock was up 4%, compared to full price sales growth of 47%, improving margin by 1.5%. 1.5% Warehousing and distribution Labour and volume efficiencies from a lower returns rate improved margin 0.9%. This was offset, mainly by COVID related surcharges for international parcels -0.7%. 0.2% Marketing and photography Margin increased as we are no longer printing catalogues 1.4%, and photography costs did not increase in line with sales 0.5%. This was offset by investment in digital marketing spend, which grew faster than sales -0.2%. 1.7% Technology I. T. costs grew faster than sales as we continued to upgrade and modernise our core systems. - 0.2% Central costs Growth in central costs reduced margin mainly due to staff incentives. - 0.4% Net margin on total sales to January 2022 19.0% 35 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Profit and Net Margin by Division Online division Total sales PSm Profit PSm Margin % Change in margin vs Jan 20 NEXT Brand UK 1,527 382 25.0% 2.8% LABEL UK 865 123 14.3% 19 0.0% Overseas 673 81 12.1% - 4.4% Total Platform 39 2 5.5% n a Total Online 3,104 588 19.0% - 0.1% The change in each division's margin versus the year ending January 2020 is shown in the right-hand column and these are explained as follows: NEXT Brand UK Margins improved mainly as a result of lower levels of surplus stock and lower returns rates during lockdown. These savings were offset by higher freight costs -1.3%, staff incentives and other central costs -0.5%. LABEL UK Margin at 14.3% was flat versus 2019 20. The benefit from lower returns rates during lockdown were offset by investments in systems development. Overseas Margin has declined due to: 1 COVID related distribution surcharges applied to parcels being shipped to customers overseas -2.7%, 2 customs clearance and administration fees -1.1%, 3 higher inbound freight costs -0.6%. Total Platform Total Platform launched in October 2020, so there is no comparative margin for the year ending January 2020. Net margin of 5.5% is broadly in line with our target margin of 6%. For clarity, this PS2m of profit excludes the profit generated from the equity stakes we have in our Total Platform clients and interest earned on financing arrangements. Across the Group P&L, Total Platform and associated equity stakes and financing profit totalled PS10m. See page 39 for a more detailed update on Total Platform. Guidance for Online Sales and Profit for the Year Ahead We are forecasting for Online full price sales to be up 1% versus 2021 22. Based on this sales guidance, Online profit is forecast to be PS512m, down -13% versus 2021 22. The reduction in profit is due to cost increases in the year ahead, which are expected to outweigh cost savings see page 62. This is mainly due to high inflationary costs wages and energy and levels of markdown stock returning to more normal levels. Our expected Online net margins by division are as follows: Net Online margins by division Jan 2023 e NEXT Brand UK 21% LABEL UK 14% Overseas 10% Total Platform 5% Total Online 15.6% 19 As a result of the increasing scale of the LABEL business we have revisited our assumptions on fixed cost allocation and we have increased the proportion of UK fixed costs that LABEL receives. The profit margins given above reflect the new cost allocation and we have restated the January 2020 margins for a like-for-like comparison. 36 LABEL Full Price Sales by Product Category Full price sales PSm Jan 2022 Jan 2020 Var % Fashion: clothing, footwear and accessories 482 274 76% Sports 158 106 50% Home 91 37 142% Branded Beauty 46 17 174% Total full price sales 777 434 79% Growth continues to come from both our existing partners as well as new brands. Full price sales with existing brands grew by PS222m and new brands net of discontinued brands added PS121m. Home and Beauty sales have seen particularly strong growth with new brands such as Laura Ashley, Bath & Body Works and MAC. Wholesale and Commission There are two ways in which we trade with third-party brands. Some brands are purchased on a wholesale arrangement and any surplus is NEXT's liability. Under our commission model, stock is held in NEXT warehouses but remains the liability of the partner brand, and NEXT earns a commission on sales full price and markdown.

Commission sales are now 64% of total LABEL sales. Platform Plus and Direct Dispatch In the last two years, we have significantly increased the number of brands using the Platform Plus and Direct Despatch operating models. This has helped us expand the ranges that we can make available to our customers without utilising our own warehouse capacity. To date, we have 353 thirdparty brands selling via Platform Plus or Direct Despatch and the combined full price sales from the two operating models have increased from PS25m in 2019 20 to PS117m in 2021 22. Platform Plus Stock is held in our partners' warehouses at the time a customer order is placed and then injected into NEXT's logistics network to be delivered to the customer, along with any other NEXT purchases. Direct Dispatch Stock is held in our partners' warehouses and delivered directly to the customer. Increasingly this stock is delivered by nominated NEXT carriers.

NEXT sources and purchases the stock, which is held at our risk. The licensor earns a royalty on sales. We generally achieve bought-in gross margins that are similar to those earned on NEXT branded stock. Full price sales in the year to January 2022 were PS39.5m, with net margins of around 16%. The table below shows the full price sales made through our licensing business, and includes sales made both Online and in Retail stores.

This increase is anticipated to come from increasing ranges with our existing partners PS15m and the introduction of new brands PS5m. We expect net margin to be around 20%. 38 TOTAL PLATFORM Our Total Platform business launched in October 2020 and is now live with five clients. In February 2022 we launched our largest client to date, Reiss. TOTAL PLATFORM OBJECTIVES AND SERVICES Focus and Stability Total Platform aims to give clients improved services, at a lower cost. It removes the operational friction and capital costs associated with rapid growth and allows client brands to focus on the development of their products and brand. Total Platform rolls fixed overheads and capital costs into one simple commission, charged as a percentage of a client's sales. In doing so it converts a capital intensive fixed cost into a flexible variable cost, meaning that in difficult years operational costs go down as fast as sales. So in the volatile world of fashion, Total Platform serves to provide stability and reduce risk. Existing and New Services In addition to its core activity of powering our clients' online businesses, Total Platform also offers other related services such as retail warehousing, retail distribution, and retail till systems. In general, these other services are charged on a cost plus basis. In preparation for the launch of Reiss Total Platform we have added the following capabilities: Bonded status for UK warehouse stock. Warehouse and logistics to other third-party vendors, such as other UK aggregators and concession stores. Export documentation, repricing and logistics to overseas aggregators and wholesale partners. Online ordering and fulfilment from Retail store stock. We intend to continue adding new services to our Total Platform business. Services will include an inbound logistics service, buying and merchandise systems and the provision of stock financing. 39 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND GUIDANCE FOR THE YEAR AHEAD In the year to January 2022 we generated PS10.3m of profit through the combination of: Total Platform profit of PS2.1m i. e. the profit for providing Total Platform services. Equity and preference share interests in our clients. Interest earned from commercial loans to Total Platform clients.

We do not expect all of these opportunities to materialise but are reasonably confident that in the year ahead we will contract with at least two new clients. Any new clients are likely to be fully integrated into Total Platform once our new warehouse Elmsall 3 is ready, which is scheduled to open in Q4 2023. 40 EVOLVING TOTAL PLATFORM OPERATING MODELS Over the last two years we adapted our Total Platform services to suit the differing needs of each of our five new clients. In doing so, we have arrived at three different operating models for the business. Each version of Total Platform gives a different experience of these three elements: The Shopping Experience Checkout, Payments and Account Management Packaging The paragraphs below summarise the main differences between the three services. Total Platform This is the most comprehensive option. The customer experience is completely independent from NEXT, with every touch point ordering, checkout, packaging, call centre services, etc. Total Platform Light TPL The shopping experience is still unique to the client brand but customers check out through NEXT checkout. The experience is not dissimilar to checking out through thirdparty payment intermediary services, such as Apple Pay or Google Pay and NEXT's 6.3m UK customers can login using their NEXT credentials. Customer communications, tracking and problem resolution is handled by NEXT services and staff. Currently TPL customers receive their orders in NEXT GO packaging, from early 2023 we aim to be able to send TPL parcels in bespoke client packaging. Total Platform Superlight The client has a client-branded home page including bespoke navigation which sits on the main NEXT website. The search listings, product pages and shopping bag functions are shared with NEXT. This is the fastest and lowest cost option for clients looking to rapidly achieve a fully functioning Online operation in the UK. This is the model that we anticipate being adopted by our UK and Eire Bath & Body Works franchise.

Profit of PS142m was down -3% versus 2019 20. PSm Jan 2022 Jan 2020 Var % Credit sales 1,977 1,748 13% Average customer receivables 1,062 1,185 - 10% Interest income 249 269 - 7% Bad debt charge 27 43 - 37% Overheads 49 43 17% Profit before cost of funding 173 183 - 6% Cost of funding 31 36 - 15% Net profit 142 147 - 3% Opening customer receivables PS1,028m PS1,207m - 15% Closing customer receivables PS1,163m PS1,234m - 6% ROCE after cost of funding 13.4% 12.4% Customer Receivables Balance Explained Our average customer receivables balance fell by -10% compared to two years ago. The decline was driven by the reduction in balances during 2020. During 2021 receivables grew along with credit sales, and finished the year up 13% on the balance as at January 2021. 42 Interest Income Interest income was down -7% compared to two years ago, which was 3% ahead of the -10% fall in average customer receivables. The difference between change in interest and customer receivables is explained by two factors: 1. A higher provision rate for bad debt has reduced customer receivables by around -2%, but this does not affect the generation of interest income. A higher proportion of customer receivables are interest bearing, with lower proportions of defaulted debt and debt on interest-free arrangements. Taken together, around 1% more of the receivables balance is interest bearing. Default Rates and Bad Debt Charge Default Rates The chart below shows 1 our observed rate of default as a percentage of customer receivables since 2010 blue bars and 2 the closing rate of provision for future defaults green dotted line. This year, default rates of 3.2% have been at a historic low and were down -26% versus the 4.3% observed two years ago. The closing provision for future defaults of 9.2% is 2.2% ahead of the pre-pandemic position, due to the additional PS20m provision made last year. We are currently maintaining a PS20m provision due to wider economic uncertainties that consumers currently face due to the cost of living crisis. Bad Debt Charge The bad debt charge of PS27m wasPS16m lower than two years ago mainly due to 1 the -26% reduction in the default rates and 2 higher recoveries of defaulted debt. Overheads Overheads of PS49m were PS6m higher than two years ago, mainly due to investment in I. T. and higher people costs, including staff incentives. 43 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Cost of Funding The cost of funding is an internal recharge from the Group based on the assumption that 85% of customer receivables are funded by debt from the Group. This charge reduced by -15% to PS31m, due to the -10% reduction in average receivables and a -5% reduction in the Group interest rate. Calculating the Cost of Funding and Group Interest Rate The Group interest rate is in line with the interest rate charged on the Group's external debt. The calculation is set out below. Our previous approach to calculating the cost of funding charge for the NEXT Finance business was set out in our January 2021 Annual Report page 41. Since then, we have made two changes to the method: 1. Cash on deposit has been removed from the average Group debt calculation and interest earned on this cash has been removed from the Group interest charge. Interest income from other investments, e. g. Reiss, has been excluded to provide the underlying cost of interest paid on external debt facilities. Applying the new method does not impact the internal charge for the full year to January 2020. Group interest % calculation Jan 2022 Jan 2020 Var % Bond - average PS1,050m PS1,052m Revolving credit facility PS0m PS155m Average Group debt PS1,050m PS1,207m - 13% Group net external interest charge PS31.9m PS43.6m Add back interest income from investments e. g. Reiss PS4.1m PS0.0m Underlying cost of Group debt PS36.0m PS43.6m - 18% Group interest rate % 3.4% 3.6% - 5% OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR AHEAD In the year ahead, we anticipate that NEXT Finance will generate a profit of around PS160m, which would be up 13% on the prior year. We are forecasting the customer receivables balance to end the year at PS1.27bn, which would be up 9% on the prior year and ahead of pre-COVID levels. 44 NEXT RETAIL FULL PRICE SALES Full price sales in the year were down -23% versus two years ago. On a like-for-like basis, comparing sales only on the days that stores were trading outside of lockdown, full price sales were down -5%. Like-for-Like Store Performance by Location The graph below shows the like-for-like performance of our stores by type for the weeks they were open in year ending January 2021 in grey and year ending January 2022 in blue versus their performance in the year ending January 2020. The graph above clearly shows the marked underperformance of city centre locations in both years: and the marked recovery across all locations in the year ending 2022. NEXT, Fosse Park West, Leicester. 45 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information RETAIL PROFIT & LOSS Total sales including the ten weeks of store closures at the start of the year were down -23% and Retail operating profit of PS107m was down -54% versus two years ago. For completeness, in the table below we have also shown Retail profit including the cost of lease interest which, under IFRS 16, is recognised within the interest line of the Group P&L and therefore not included in Retail's operating profit. Accounting for this lease interest charge would result in a Retail profit of PS65m, down -63% versus two years ago. PSm Jan 2022 Jan 2020 Var PSm Var % Total sales 1,432 1,852 420 - 23% Operating profit post-IFRS 16 107 234 127 - 54% Lease interest charge 21 42 57 15 - 26% Retail profit including lease interest 65 177 112 - 63% Full Year Profit Walk Forward The following table sets out the sales and major heads of cost for this year and two years ago, along with the value and percentage variance. The last column shows the impact on Retail's profit margin. The paragraphs after the table explain the main changes in margin and costs. PS42m is the proportion of the total lease interest that is attributable to the Retail business. 46 Achieved Gross Margin The achieved gross margin of 58.8% was -0.5% lower than two years ago. There were three factors impacting margin: 1 an unplanned increase in freight costs eroded margin by -1.0%, 2 low levels of markdown stock in the second half improved margin by 0.4% and 3 lower stock losses during the period that stores were closed improved margin by 0.1%. Rent Depreciation and Service Charge Costs reduced by PS25m, due to 1 stores that have closed in the last two years and 2 rent reductions that were achieved when leases were renegotiated during the last two years. Business Rates The PS28m reduction in business rates comprises: 1 PS20m of Government rates relief, relating to the weeks that our stores were closed due to lockdown, 2 a PS6m saving from stores that have closed in the last two years and 3 a PS2m saving from lease renewals where business rates are now part of the overall rent deal see page 48. Note: A further PS29m of business rates relief was available to the Company during the time that stores were open, but this was not accepted and was voluntarily repaid in January 2022. Store Payroll Inflationary wage increases and lower productivity meant that costs did not fall in line with sales. Warehouse, Distribution and Central Costs The fixed nature of certain costs in warehousing, distribution and central overheads meant that these costs did not fall in line with sales. Lease Interest Lease interest, relating to Retail lease liabilities, reduced by PS15m versus two years ago. This fell as a result of lease liabilities reducing from PS1,239m at January 2020 down to PS934m at January 2022. The effective interest rate applied on this balance is c. 4.5%. Guidance for Retail Sales and Profit for the Year Ahead We are forecasting Retail full price sales to be up 13% versus 2021 22. Excluding the 10 weeks in the prior year when our stores were closed due to lockdown, full price sales are expected to be down -7%. Based on this sales forecast, Retail operating profit is forecast to be c. PS150m, up 40% versus 2021 22. Including lease interest, Retail profit is forecast to be c. PS115m. 47 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information LEASE RENEWALS AND COMMITMENTS Lease Renewals in the Year Ended January 2022 In the year we renewed 60 leases, with an average lease term of 2.8 years to the earlier of the break clause or the lease end. These new leases result in an annualised cost saving of PS9.1m. These 60 renewals can be split into two different types of leases. There were 49 rent deals where we negotiated, on average, a -44% rent reduction. The other 11 leases were 'total occupancy cost' TOC deals where we pay a fixed percentage of turnover to cover rent, business rates and service charge, reducing our overall occupancy costs by -52%. The tables below summarise the leases renewed in the last year along with the rent 22 and occupancy costs before and after renewal. For clarity, we have shown TOC leases separately in order to show the overall impact on the stores' total occupancy costs, including rent, rates and service charge. New rent deal category No. of leases Rent before renewal Rent after renewal Fixed rent charge 37 PS10.1m PS6.5m - 35% Zero rent 4 PS0.6m PS0.0m - 100% Turnover rent 8 PS3.7m PS1.5m - 58% Total 49 PS14.4m PS8.0m - 44% TOC leases No. of leases Costs before renewal Costs after renewal Total occupancy costs rents, rates and service charge - PS2.6m Previous rent PS2.7m - Previous rates and service charge PS2.6m - Total occupancy - rent, rates and service charge 11 PS5.3m PS2.6m - 52% TOTAL COMBINED LEASE RENEWALS No. of leases Costs before renewal Costs after renewal Total lease renewals 60 PS19.7m PS10.6m - 46% Total occupancy cost saving Rent-free incentive capital contributions PS2.8m We continue to invest in stores where we have renewed the lease and we spent PS5.6m upgrading the stores that we renewed in the last 12 months. Outstanding Lease Commitments At the end of January 2022, our average lease commitment weighted by value was 4.9 years, compared with 5.5 years at the same time last year. Fifty per cent of our store leases by value will expire or break within 4.1 years and 90% within the next ten years. Forecast Lease Renewals in the Year Ended January 2023 We anticipate renewing 72 store leases and based on our latest negotiations we expect to reduce our occupancy cash costs by c. PS17.5m -45%. This saving is particularly high because some of the stores coming up for renewal include large stores with a high base rent cost, which are moving to a variable TOC lease. The average lease term to the earlier of the break clause or lease end is expected to be 4.5 years. 22 Note that the savings given here are the actual rents payable rather than IFRS 16 rent depreciation. PS9.1m 48 RETAIL SPACE The year-on-year change in store numbers and square footage is set out below. Within the eight re-sites, there was one location where we consolidated two stores into one, reducing our number of stores by one hence, the number of new mainline stores in the table above is zero. The nine new and re-sited stores have performed well and we expect the stores to make a net profit before central overheads of 22%. We anticipate that payback on capital invested will be within 10 months, which is well within our investment criteria hurdle of 24 months. Mainline Closures We closed 19 mainline stores, three of which came as a result of being unable to agree acceptable new terms with landlords and two where the landlord did not wish to renew the lease due to redevelopment of the site. The other 14 closures were in locations where we forecast that the store would not achieve our target margin on almost any terms. The table below sets out the profitability and turnover of stores falling into each category of closure. Reason for store closure No. of stores Store turnover Store profit Store profit % Location not viable 14 PS16.9m PS1.6m 9% Landlord redeveloping the site 2 PS2.6m PS0.5m 19% Failure to agree acceptable terms 3 PS4.1m PS0.4m 10% Total 19 PS23.6m PS2.5m 11% Clearance Stores We opened six new Clearance stores and closed one. New stores have an average lease term to the earlier of break or lease end of three years. The rent cost in these stores is based on store turnover, with five of the six leases being TOC deals. Opening Clearance stores means that we can sell more of our surplus stock in Retail, alleviating some of the capacity pressures in our Online warehouses. Outlook for Retail Space in 2022 23 In the year ahead we expect retail space to reduce by around -2%, due to the closure of around 15 stores. 49 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITIES The profits and losses in the year from other business activities, including our other Group trading companies and non-trading activities, are summarised below. Significant changes in profit are explained beneath the table. PSm Jan 2022 Jan 2020 NEXT Sourcing NS 28.0 32.2 Lipsy 20.5 13.0 Victoria's Secret Joint Venture 3.4 - Reiss 1.8 - Franchise and Retail International 5.8 6.4 Property management 10.8 1.7 Central costs and other non-trading activities 33.1 23.5 Total profit 37.2 26.4 NEXT Sourcing NS Profit was down -13% versus two years ago, due to a -2% fall in sales and additional overhead costs relating to COVID, shipping and container delays, staff incentives and foreign currency movements. Lipsy The significant increase in profit was driven by the expansion of our Branded Beauty business see page 37 and an improvement in clothing sales, with demand for occasion and formalwear being particularly strong in the second half of the year with the return of social events. In the year ahead we anticipate profits of around PS30m. Victoria's Secret Joint Venture This is the profit from our 51% stake in the Victoria's Secret UK and Eire JV. The UK website, operating on NEXT's Total Platform, launched during May 2021. Profit of PS3.4m was lower than our previous forecast of PS5m given in September, mainly due to stock shortages experienced in the second half. In the year ahead we anticipate profit of around PS4m. Reiss This is the profit from our 25% stake in Reiss. In February 2022, Reiss launched on NEXT's Total Platform see page 39. At the end of February, we exercised our option to buy a further 26% stake in Reiss. The transaction is currently expected to complete in April, subject to regulatory clearance. Based on our increased shareholding, we are forecasting profit in the year ahead of around PS4m. Property Management Profit of PS10.8m came mainly from two sale and leaseback transactions. We received PS6m, the second of three instalments relating to the sale and leaseback of a warehouse complex in 2020. This was payable upon NEXT maintaining its investment grade credit rating. The third and final instalment of PS6m, which is also contingent on meeting investment grade conditions, is payable in 2022 23. During 2021 we entered a sale and leaseback transaction relating to the development of our new Elmsall 3 warehouse, generating PS7m of profit in the year. Central Costs Central costs were PS10m higher than two years ago, mainly due to: 1 higher cost of employee share schemes and 2 higher service costs on the defined benefit pension scheme resulting from a change in actuarial assumptions. 50 INTEREST, TAX, PENSIONS AND ESG INTEREST The interest charge in the P&L is made up of three categories, as set out below, along with our guidance for the year ahead. PSm Jan 2023 e Jan 2022 Jan 2020 Net external interest 25.7 35.3 43.6 Reiss preference share income and loan interest 4.5 3.4 - Lease interest 47.4 50.4 61.8 Total interest 68.6 82.3 105.4 The net external interest charge of PS35.3m, was PS8.3m -19% lower than two years ago. This reduction is due to the decline in average net debt, along with lower average interest charges following the repayment of the PS325m bond in October 2021 see page 55. Reiss preference shares were acquired as part of our investment. The shares accrue interest at a rate of 8% per annum, giving a PS2.4m benefit in the year. A further PS1m of interest was earned on a PS10m loan given to Reiss. We expect this loan to be repaid in the first half of 2022 23. Guidance for the year ahead is based on a 51% equity stake see page 50. The reduction in lease interest is consistent with the overall reduction in lease debt, from PS1.25bn January 2020 to PS1.1bn January 2022, as we pay rent and renew leases on shorter terms and lower or variable rents. TAX Our effective tax rate ETR for 2021 22 was 17.7%. This is lower than the UK headline rate of 19% for two reasons, as set out below. In 2022 23 we are also forecasting our ETR to be 17.7%. Jan 2022 Headline UK Corporation Tax rate 19.0% Remeasurement of deferred tax asset to 25% 23 - 0.6% Super deduction for capital allowances 130% deduction for qualifying expenditure - 0.7% ETR 17.7% 23 The remeasurement of the deferred tax asset occurred during the first half of the year. The headline UK Corporation Tax rate effective from April 2023 will be 25%. 51 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information PENSION SCHEME On the IFRS accounting basis, the valuation of our defined benefit schemes' surplus has increased from PS99m as at January 2021 to PS157m as at January 2022. Further detail is provided in Note 6 of the financial statements. ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE ESG ESG encompasses a broad range of complex global issues which can be challenging to navigate and prioritise. However, we continue to make good progress and our key ESG initiatives are summarised below. These and other aspects of our work will be covered in detail in our Annual Report, published on 14 April 2022. Carbon Emission Reductions As reported at the half year, the targets we set for the reduction in our Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions i. e. those created directly by our operations and indirectly through our wider business activities were approved in July 2021 by the Science-Based Emission Target initiative SBTi. Our scope 1 and 2 target ambitions are consistent with the reductions required to keep global warming to 1.5degC, in line with the Paris Agreement. By 2030 we aim to: Reduce our direct and indirect from NEXT energy consumption absolute carbon emissions by 55% against a 2016 17 baseline Scope 1 & 2. Reduce our other indirect emissions from NEXT's operations by 40% against a 2019 20 baseline per PS1m sales Scope 3. Responsible Sourcing We aim to source 100% of the main raw materials we use through known, responsible or certified routes by 2025. We are making it easier for customers to identify sustainably sourced items: products containing at least 50% of certified responsibly sourced materials are eligible to carry a NEXT Generation label. In the first half of the year, we launched a small trial menswear range focused on sustainability and made using 100% responsibly-sourced materials. The customer response was muted: this may be due in part to the particular style of the product range but the level of interest also indicates that our customers are not yet prioritising responsible sourcing as a key reason to buy. Rather than producing standalone lines with a responsible sourcing message, our intention is to absorb them into our normal lines. Electrification of our Car and Van Fleets We have committed to electrifying our company car and van fleet where possible by 2030. Where electric vehicles are not viable, we will look to use ultra-low emission vehicles. Packaging By 2025 we aim to eliminate avoidable plastics in product packaging and we are also investigating opportunities to reduce packaging throughout our operations. By the end of 2022, we plan to install collection points in all our stores for customers to return their plastic packaging for recycling. 52 CASH FLOW, DIVIDENDS, NET DEBT & FINANCING CASH FLOW 24 In the year to January 2022, we generated PS363m of surplus cash. Surplus cash is defined as cash after interest, tax, capital expenditure and investments, but before distributions to shareholders. NEXT Finance customer receivables grew by PS135m in the year, partly reversing the PS206m reduction experienced during the pandemic in the prior year see page 42. In total, we returned PS353m to shareholders, by way of 1 special dividends PS344m and 2 share buybacks PS9m. The table below sets out a summarised cash flow for the year, along with the prior two years for context and comparison.

Depreciation on right-of-use assets and lease payments are included in working capital. The change is presentational only, it has no impact on the actual cash generated by the business. A reconciliation to statutory cash flow is provided in the Appendix. 53 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information INVESTMENTS Investment in Reiss We invested PS33m in a 25% stake in Reiss and as part of this deal we also provided a PS10m loan. At the end of February 2022, we exercised our option to buy a further 26% stake. The transaction is expected to complete in April 2022, subject to regulatory clearance, taking our total shareholding to 51%. Sale and Leasebacks and Property Acquisitions Our new Elmsall 3 warehouse is in the process of being built and the net cash outflow of PS30m is the combination of PS53m spent in the year less PS23m of sale and leaseback proceeds received to date. We have also acquired land for a potential future development, costing PS24m. PSm Jan 2022 Jan 2021 2020 warehouse sale and leaseback 25 - 146 Elmsall 3 warehouse sale and leaseback 30 - Land acquisition for potential future development 24 Total 54 146 DIVIDENDS AND SHAREHOLDER RETURNS The Company remains committed to its long term policy of returning surplus cash, that cannot be profitably invested in the business, to shareholders. During the pandemic in 2020 21, we paused dividends to help secure the finances of the business. In the year to January 2022 we paid two special dividends and in the year ahead we will return to our pre-pandemic ordinary dividend cycle. Special Dividends On 3 September 2021 we paid a special dividend of 110p per share and on 28 January 2022 we paid a further special dividend of 160p per share. The total value of special dividends paid in the year was PS344m. Ordinary Dividends In the year ahead it is the Board's intention to return to our pre-pandemic ordinary dividend cycle. Therefore, the Board has proposed the payment of an ordinary dividend of 127p, to be paid on 1 August 2022. The dividend cover has been calculated at 2.8 times post tax profits for the year ending January 2022. The dividend cover of 2.8 times is in line with the Company's long-standing approach to ordinary dividends. Jan 2022 January 2022 post tax profit PS677m Dividend cover 2.8 times Dividend value PS242m 66% payable August 2022 PS160m Pence per share 127p This is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 19 May 2022. Shares will trade ex-dividend from 7 July 2022 and the record date will be 8 July 2022. 25 In the prior year the cash flow statement in the CEO Report was based on pre IFRS 16 values. The amount shown in respect of the 2020 sale and leaseback was PS110m this being the cash proceeds of PS154m less the gain recognised in profit before tax of PS44m. This year we have restated this value to show the cash proceeds less gain in the profit before tax on an IFRS 16 basis of PS8m. 54 Share Buybacks During January 2022 we purchased 117,500 shares at an average share price of PS73.90. The total value of shares purchased was PS8.7m, reducing the number of shares in issue by 0.1%. Shareholder Returns in the Year Ahead In the year ahead, surplus cash after interest, tax, capital expenditure, investments or acquisitions and ordinary dividends will be returned to shareholders by way of share buybacks or special dividends. Any share buybacks would be subject to achieving a minimum 8% equivalent rate of return ERR. As a reminder, ERR is calculated by dividing the anticipated pre-tax profits by the current market capitalisation. 26 NET DEBT, BOND AND BANK FACILITIES In October 2021 we settled our PS325m bond and did not issue a new bond. Our current bond and bank facilities now total PS1,250m. Based on our profit and cash flow central guidance for the year ahead, our January 2023 year end net debt excluding lease liabilities is forecast at PS620m, broadly growing in line with Group profit before tax. We expect net debt to peak at around PS680m in October 2022. This would be comfortably within our bond and bank facilities of PS1,250m, with headroom of PS630m at January 2023. The chart below sets out our bond and bank facilities. For context, our year end forecast for customer receivables is also shown. At PS1.27bn, this asset is double the value of our net debt. 26 Market capitalisation is calculated based on shares in circulation, so excludes shares in the NEXT Employee Share Option Trust. 55 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information CAPITAL EXPENDITURE SPEND BY CATEGORY The table below sets out our capital expenditure for the year along with our forecast for the year ahead. For comparison, the prior two years are also shown.

It will deliver an estimated increase in boxed capacity of 45%, with marginal labour cost per unit around 40% lower than the equivalent cost today. We anticipate that warehouse capital expenditure in the year ahead will remain at a similar level. Technology and Other This year we invested PS31m modernising and upgrading our core systems. PS23m was spent on software and PS8m on hardware. In the year ahead, we expect to increase capital expenditure on technology to around PS36m as we increase the number of developers employed to continue our modernisation programme. For more details on how we are developing our systems and technology infrastructure please see Page 14 of our July 2021 Half Year Report 27. Retail Stores Capital expenditure on Retail space expansion reduced to PS14m, from PS29m in the prior year, as a result of fewer new store openings. Cosmetic and maintenance spend was PS15m, which was more in line with pre-pandemic levels of spend. Spend in the year to January 2021, at PS8m, was lower than normal due to work being deferred during the pandemic. In the year ahead, we anticipate that total expenditure on Retail stores will be PS34m, although within this figure less will be spent on new space and more will be spent on existing stores, mainly where leases are being renewed. co. uk media Files N Next-PLC-V2 documents 2022 %20290921. pdf 56 THREE YEAR OUTLOOK FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE In the next 24 months, phase one of our new Online boxed warehouse Elmsall 3 will be completed. Following this, the expected capital expenditure in warehousing will fall to around PS75m. 57 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information PART FIVE OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR AHEAD CONSUMER AND ECONOMY A World of Uncertainty From an economic perspective, it is hard to recall a time when sales have been harder to forecast. The table below sets out the negative and positive factors that we have considered when estimating our sales for the year ahead. Negative For Sales Growth Positive For Sales Growth External Economic Factors i The unwinding of pandemic savings. ii A return to spending on travel and leisure. iii Inflation in competing essential goods. iv Likely increases in UK taxes and mortgage rates. v Further disruption to supply chain and prices as a result of conflict in Ukraine. i Strong growth in nominal earnings up 4.8% 28 in January. ii Employment rates remain high at 75.6% 29 and 31.2m people in work. Internal Factors i Inflation in NEXT's selling prices in the first half is forecast to be 3.7%. In the second half this figure is now forecast to be 8% 6.5% fashion and 13% on Home : this is 2% higher than our January estimate. ii Reversal of lockdown trends, particularly spending on homeware. i Much better anticipated stock levels in Q3 and Q4 of 2022 23 compared to the previous year. ii A marked return to spending on adult fashion, particularly formal clothing for events and work. iii Opportunities to develop new products and business activities. It would be wrong for NEXT to imply that it had any special insight into how all these uncertainties will translate into sales growth for the Group. Our central guidance represents our best guess, based partly on our assessment of the economy but also on our instinct and the evidence we have from our sales so far this year. Implications for Sales Guidance When we issued our guidance in January, many believed that NEXT was being overly cautious, today that guidance looks realistic, if not a little optimistic. Actually, sales to date, in the UK, are ahead of our January forecast and our expectations for total UK sales in the year have increased by PS45m, as we now think our stores will fare slightly better than initially anticipated. So the -2% reduction in our sales guidance is caused by the closure of our Russian and Ukrainian websites, along with reductions in sales estimates for some other overseas territories. 28 ONS: Whole Economy Year on Year 3 Month Avg Growth % Nov 21 to Jan 22 : Total Pay Excluding Arrears, issued 15.03. 29 ONS: Labour market by age group 16-64 seasonally adjusted issued 15.03. 58 NEW FULL PRICE SALES GUIDANCE IN DETAIL REVISED GUIDANCE BY DIVISION We have reduced our central guidance for full year full price sales growth from 7% to 5% versus 2021 22. This reduces full price sales by PS85m, all of which can be accounted for by anticipated losses overseas. The following table breaks out the change between UK Online LABEL and NEXT Brand, Online Overseas and Retail. For completeness, the right-hand column of the table shows our guidance for the last three quarters of the year. This is a better measure of our expectations for underlying sales as our stores were open in the comparable period of the previous year.

For clarity, we had no Retail stores or franchise partners in either country. We have assumed that we will remain closed in both countries for the rest of the year, and have removedPS65m from our full price sales guidance. Note 2: Sales in Other Overseas Territories We have reduced our sales expectations in other overseas territories byPS70m. In our initial forecast we had not reversed enough of the sales gained last year from the closure of retail stores during overseas lockdowns last year. Like-for-like sales in territories excluding Russia and Ukraine are expected to be up 10% in Q2-Q4. Note 3: Retail Faring Better than Expected We have Increased UK retail sales estimate by PS78m, reflecting our stores' better than expected performance versus three years ago. Note 4: UK Online Sales Moderated We have reduced our expectations for UK online sales byPS33m of whichPS7m from LABEL andPS26m from NEXT Brand as a result of potentially better than anticipated sales in Retail stores. 59 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information REVISED SALES GUIDANCE BY QUARTER It is helpful to break our guidance down into two parts: The period of time when our stores were closed in February, March and April broadly corresponding to the first quarter of the year. The last three quarters of the year when our stores were open in 2021. In the first quarter we expect strong growth, driven by exceptionally weak comparatives in 2021. In Q2, Q3 and Q4 we face the opposite effect, with sales in these periods last year boosted by the spending of lockdown savings and the release of pent-up demand for clothing. The graph below shows the sales growth we anticipate in our central scenario for each quarter. The solid bars show the growth against last year, the green line gives the compound annual growth rate CAGR against three years ago 2019 20 which is the last year unaffected by COVID. 60 NEW PROFIT GUIDANCE The table below sets out three scenarios for sales, profit and EPS. For completeness, the second row in the table shows the implied full price sales growth for Q2 to Q4.

The last two bars show the impact on profit of the cost savings and cost increases we anticipate in the year ahead. The reason that the anticipated PS30m Online sales growth delivers so little margin is down to sales mix. We anticipate losing PS40m of own brand Online sales and gaining PS70m of lower margin LABEL sales. The loss of NEXT Online sales comes from the reversal of the gains we made Online when our Retail stores were closed last year. 30 Earnings Per Share is calculated based on an estimate of the timing of potential share buybacks and forecast ETR, assuming a share price of PS65.00. 61 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information FORECAST OF COST SAVINGS AND COST INCREASES FOR 2022 23 Cost increases PSm Jan 2023 e Wage inflation across the Group - 55 Higher surplus stock and lower clearance rates - 35 Energy cost inflation - 20 NEXT Technology - 17 Marketing and photography -5 Warehousing and distribution -5 Product team travel and other -6 Total cost increases - 143 Cost savings PSm Jan 2023 e Lower staff incentives 35 Price increases to cover freight cost increases 25 Lower external interest costs 10 Reduction in overseas parcel freight surcharges 7 Other cost savings 2 Total cost savings 79 NEXT Selling Price Inflation Our expectations for inflation in our like-for-like selling prices, for the first half, remains at 3.7%, in line with the estimate we gave in January. Our estimate for selling price inflation in the second half of the year has increased from 6% to 8% a combination of 6.5% on fashion and 13% on homeware and furniture. 62 NEXT COMMENT ON THE ECONOMY A Supply Side Problem The disruption to global supply chains along with chronic labour shortages in many parts of the UK economy, mean that there are simply not enough goods, energy and skilled workers to maintain living standards at the levels we have become used to. It is important to understand that the cost of living crisis is a supply side crisis: the inflation we are experiencing is a symptom of underlying constraints in the supply of goods. There are two types of measures the Government can take in response to a squeeze on supply. Firstly, they can and should ensure that those most in need can afford basic essentials, through targeted subsidies and grants. Secondly, they can take action to increase the supply of goods, property and services that are in such short supply. We applaud the efforts the Chancellor has made to help out those most in need. But we are disappointed that the wider Government has done little or nothing within its powers to increase the underlying supply of goods, energy and skilled workers. It is important to recognise that Government interventions to 'pay for' inflationary increases does nothing to increase the underlying supply of goods and services. The good news is that there is much the Government can do to increase supply. It can reverse the self-defeating barriers it has placed on overseas workers supporting our economy and accelerate, simplify and reform the planning process to increase the supply of desperately needed housing. We hope that the Government will use its powers wisely and do all it can to tackle the UK's many supply side constraints. 63 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information CASH FLOW FORECAST FOR 2022 2023 Based on our revised sales and profit guidance, we expect to generate surplus cash, before distribution to shareholders, of PS440m. Our intention is to return surplus cash to shareholders by way of 1 ordinary dividends and 2 special dividends or share buybacks see page 54. We expect net debt to grow in line with profit growth, therefore closing the year at January 2023 at PS620m.

Lord Wolfson of Aspley Guise Chief Executive 24 March 2022 64 APPENDIX SECTION 1 - STATUTORY SALES AND IFRS 16 LEASES STATUTORY BASIS PSm and EPS Jan 2022 Jan 2021 Jan 2020 Revenue 4,625.9 3,534.4 4,266.2 Profit before taxation 823.1 342.4 748.5 Earnings Per Share Basic 530.8p 223.3p 472.4p Net debt including leases 1,657.6 1,796.1 2,363.1 OVERVIEW The financial information presented in pages 2 to 64 is used by management in assessing business performance. It is also the financial information used to inform business decisions and investment appraisals. Some of these financial metrics and performance measures are not prepared on a full IFRS statutory accounting basis. It is common for the use of performance measures that are not based on the statutory IFRS values to be called \"Alternative Performance Measures\" APMs. An explanation of the APMs used by the business is provided in the glossary. Differences between APMs and Statutory Results In common with many retailers, we use \"Total Sales\" as a measure to assess the performance of the business, and not statutory revenue. We have applied this approach consistently with prior years and our Trading Statements. It is our view that this provides both a useful and necessary basis for understanding the Group's performance and results. In previous years we have also reported our Group profit and EPS on a pre-IFRS 16 basis. This year we have fully embedded IFRS 16 into our reported results so that they align with their statutory equivalents. Offset Sales The financial year ended 30 January 2021 was a 53 week period. This means that 2021 22 started one calendar week later than the previous two financial years. Throughout this document, unless otherwise stated, the results presented are not adjusted for this \"offset\" week and we show the results for the 52 weeks to 29 January 2022, 53 weeks to 30 January 2021 and 52 weeks to 24 January 2020. This is to ensure consistency with the results previously presented for each period. When presenting sales analysis by week, month or quarter, we believe it is more helpful for the reader to view information on a like-for-like calendar week basis. For these charts and tables we have adjusted the comparative data so that each period is prepared on a like-for-like week basis. Accounting period Like-for-like sales reporting period Full year Start End Start End Jan 2022 31 Jan 2021 29 Jan 2022 31 Jan 2021 29 Jan 2022 Jan 2021 25 Jan 2020 30 Jan 2021 01 Feb 2020 30 Jan 2021 Jan 2020 26 Jan 2019 24 Jan 2020 02 Feb 2019 31 Jan 2020 65 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information SALES AND STATUTORY REVENUE Sales presented on pages 2 to 64 are based on \"Total Sales\". \"Total Sales\" are VAT exclusive sales, including the full value of commission based sales and interest income. For statutory reporting purposes two adjustments are made to derive statutory revenue: 1. Where third-party branded goods are sold on a commission basis, only the commission receivable is included in statutory revenue. Other income, which includes customer delivery charges, income for printed publications, promotional discounts, interest free credit commission costs and unredeemed gift card balances is included in statutory revenue. The reduction in Total Sales has a corresponding adjustment recognised in cost of sales. The percentage of our Total Sales achieved on a commission basis has increased significantly due to the growth in our third-party branded businesses, LABEL and Total Platform. Because only the commission element is recognised in statutory revenue, this means that growth in statutory revenue 8.4% versus 2019 20 is lower than the growth reported in Total Sales 11.5%. IFRS 16 LEASES While NEXT has applied IFRS 16 in its statutory accounts since January 2020, this is the first full year reporting period in which we have fully integrated the impact of IFRS 16 into the CEO Report. As a result of this change, key metrics used in the CEO Report, including Group profit before tax, EPS and segmental profits, are different to those presented in prior years as they are now based on the statutory i. e. IFRS values. In order to help readers understand the impact of this change the following pages provide: 1 A brief reminder on how IFRS 16 accounts for leases and, in particular, how the profile of the NEXT leases impacts on its financial statements. 2 Summary income statements that show the impact of IFRS 16 for January 2021, January 2020 and January 2019. For the year ended January 2022, we have fully embedded IFRS 16 so no bridge is presented for this year. 66 IFRS 16 Leases - A Brief Reminder Prior to IFRS 16, the total rent payable under an operating lease was charged to the P&L on a straight line basis each year. The future rental commitment, and the right to use the leased asset, was not recognised in the accounts - the lease was \"off balance sheet\". In contrast, IFRS 16 applies an \"on balance sheet\" approach to leases. This is achieved by: Recognising a right-of-use asset: this represents the lessee's right to use the leased asset for the lease term. Recognising a lease liability which reflects the lessee's obligation to make payments under the terms of the lease. This has the effect of bringing operating leases onto the balance sheet. Due to the changes on the balance sheet, the nature and timing of costs being recognised in the income statement also change, with depreciation being recognised on the right-of-use asset and finance costs being recognised on the lease liability. The rental costs recognised under the previous accounting standard for leases, IAS 17, are then excluded. This change impacts the phasing of costs recognised in the income statement, as shown in the illustrative graph below. Under IFRS 16 depreciation costs are recognised on the right-of-use asset and remain consistent during the lease term. Finance costs charged to the P&L are higher at the start of the lease when the liability to pay is higher and reduce over the lease term. The total IFRS 16 cost is therefore higher in the early years see years 1-2 in the graph above. In contrast, under the previous accounting rules IAS 17 the entire lease cost was recognised on a straight line basis as represented by the horizontal line in the chart above. It is important to note that while the nature and profile of the P&L charge has changed, the total cost recognised over the term of the lease will remain the same. 67 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Impact of IFRS 16 on the Income Statement in 2020 21 and 2019 20 Income Statement by Segment Under IFRS 16 the lease costs, being split between depreciation and finance costs, are shown in two separate lines - depreciation is above operating profit, finance costs below. IFRS 16 has a significant, positive impact on the reported operating profit: this is then partially offset by the finance costs which are below operating profit. To illustrate the impact, the tables below show the pre and post IFRS 16 Income Statement for our main business segments in 2020 21, down to post tax profit. PSm Jan 21 excluding IFRS 16 IFRS 16 impact Jan 21 including IFRS 16 Online 472.1 4.4 476.5 Finance 127.1 - 127.1 Retail 205.9 69.6 136.3 Other business activity 42.8 13.7 56.5 Recharge of interest costs 33.7 - 33.7 Operating profit 384.2 60.3 444.5 Net external interest 42.2 - 42.2 Lease interest - 59.9 59.9 Profit before tax 342.0 0.4 342.4 Tax 51.4 4.3 55.7 Profit after tax 290.6 3.9 286.7 Earnings Per Share basic 226.3p 223.3p PSm Jan 20 excluding IFRS 16 IFRS 16 impact Jan 20 including IFRS 16 Online 399.6 10.9 410.5 Finance 146.7 - 146.7 Retail 163.9 70.0 233.9 Other business activity 25.6 0.9 26.5 Recharge of interest costs 36.3 - 36.3 Operating profit 772.1 81.8 853.9 Net external interest 43.6 - 43.6 Lease interest - 61.8 61.8 Profit before tax 728.5 20.0 748.5 Tax 134.6 3.7 138.3 Profit after tax 593.9 16.3 610.2 Earnings Per Share basic 459.8p 472.4p 68 In January 2020, on adoption of IFRS 16 for the first time in the statutory accounts, we recognised a significant portion of the lease costs directly in reserves. Where the lease portfolio is stable, this will result in lower lease costs being recognised in the Income Statement going forward. This was evident in the January 2020 Income Statement, which showed a benefit to profit before tax of PS20.0m when it was restated for IFRS 16. In contrast, for the year to January 2021 the impact on profit before tax of IFRS 16 was just PS0.4m and was the result of 1 the underlying adjustment, 2 the impact of store impairments and 3 gain on the sale and leaseback as set out below: 1. Underlying IFRS 16 transactions PS20m: This represents the IFRS 16 adjustment on underlying normal trade and can be viewed in four components: 1 IAS 17 rent costs net of capital contribution and other lease incentives of PS212m: 2 benefit from reassessment of lease term of PS6m less 3 the IFRS 16 depreciationPS138m: and 4 finance costs on the lease liability ofPS60m. Lease provisions and impairment PS16m: The property and onerous lease provision charge of PS100m recognised under pre-IFRS 16 accounting has been reversed and an impairment charge for store assets and right-of-use assets of PS84m was recognised. The net charge in the Income Statement for these costs was therefore PS16m lower than the pre-IFRS 16 charge. Sale and leaseback gainPS36m: Under pre-IFRS 16 accounting the gain on the sale and leaseback is calculated as proceeds less the net book value of the assets being sold. However, under IFRS 16 the approach is different. IFRS 16 limits any gain to the element of the asset which it no longer has access to use. The gain is effectively limited to the 'portion' of the asset not reacquired under the terms of the leaseback. This resulted in the recognition of a smaller gain of PS8.1m. Cash Flow Bridge The cash flow statement presented in the CEO Review is consistent with the cash flow statement used by management in its decision making processes and internal reporting. It is this view of the cash flows, and in particular the \"Surplus Cash\" line, that informs decision making on distributions. However, this approach, while used by management, is not consistent with the presentation of cash flows on a statutory basis. In this section we provide a walk forward from Surplus Cash presented in the CEO Review cash flow to \"net cash from operating activities\" in the statutory cash flow. The overall total cash flow is the same - the difference is limited to presentation. Statutory Cash Flow The statutory cash flow is split into three main sections: Operating activities: Cash flows primarily derived from our revenue-producing activities. Investing activities: Cash flows that result in the recognition of an asset in the balance sheet i. e. capex or investing in another company. Financing activities: Cash flows that result from financing - issue of shares, share buybacks, issue of bonds, interest payments receipts, dividends and leases. The cash flow in the CEO Review is presented in a different way, as explained further overleaf. 69 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Cash Flow Bridge The table below, and accompanying notes, provide a high level bridge between the \"surplus cash\" used by management and its closest statutory equivalent \"cash from operating activities\". Note PSm Surplus cash from trading activities - per CEO Review 1 595 Add back interest charge to get to Group PBT 2 82 Depreciation impairment on plant, property and equipment 3 16 Capital expenditure 4 184 Purchase of shares by ESOT 5 151 Disposal of shares by ESOT 5 72 Customer receivables 6 135 Lease payments net of incentives 7 160 Working capital and other 8 22 Net cash from operating activities - as per statutory cash flow 9 971 Note 1: As per the cash flow statement on page 53 of the CEO Review, Surplus Cash was PS595m for the year to January 2022. Note 2: The cash flow in the CEO Review starts with the Group profit before tax of PS823m, which is after interest costs. This differs from the statutory cash flow statement, which starts its cash flow statement with \"operating profit\" of PS905m. The difference of PS82m relates to the Group interest charge. Note 3: The cash flow in the CEO Review includes the depreciation, amortisation, impairment and disposals of our plant, property and equipment. In the statutory cash flow these items are presented within operating cash flows and investing activities. Note 4: Management includes the capital expenditure capex which it considers to be part of its trading activity and hence within its Surplus Cash. In the statutory cash flow all capex is included within investing activity and hence not part of operating cash flows. Therefore the capex of PS184m in the CEO Review has been added back in the bridge above. Note 5: The purchase and disposal of shares in the ESOT is recognised as part of Surplus cash in the CEO Review. This is classified as financing activity in the statutory cash flow. Note 6: The customer receivables cash movement relates to the nextpay receivables balance. For management purposes, movements in this balance are excluded from Surplus Cash. In contrast, this is included within operating cash flow for statutory reporting. Note 7: The cash flows associated with our leases, which are predominantly store related, are considered by management to be an integral part of our trading cash flows and hence are included in the calculation of Surplus Cash. From a statutory perspective, lease cash flows are included in financing activity as a lease is deemed a form of debt. Note 8: The remaining difference relates to immaterial movements on working capital and other items such as the equity profit from our investments. Note 9: This value of PS971m can be reconciled to the line \"Net cash from operating activities\" in the statutory cash flow statement. 70 SECTION 2 - THREE YEAR COMPARATIVES Throughout the CEO Report, unless otherwise stated, comparisons of sales, profit and debt have been explained relative to two years ago 2019 20. Disruption in the prior year 2020 21 from COVID means that one year comparisons are generally not meaningful. However, in accordance with the statutory requirements, the financial statements present the results for the current year and the prior period 2020 21.

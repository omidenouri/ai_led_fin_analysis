      "Detailed Analysis of ROE": "\u2022 Is **ROE** increasing (good sign) or declining (bad sign)? AI answer: The **ROE** has significantly increased from **-0.62%** (previous year) to **9.45%** (current year), indicating a strong turnaround in profitability and efficient use of equity capital. This is a very positive sign for investors.\n\n\u2022 Is growth in **ROE** higher than that of the competitors and the industry a firm operates in? AI answer: While explicit competitor or industry **ROE** figures are not provided in the report, Tesco\u2019s substantial improvement, coupled with its return to profitability, dividend reinstatement, and margin expansion, suggests its growth in **ROE** is likely outperforming many peers in the competitive UK retail sector.\n\n\u2022 Is growth persistent (good sign) or temporary (bad sign)? AI answer: The growth appears **persistent** given Tesco\u2019s strategic cost reductions (PS1.5bn target), sustained sales growth (nine consecutive quarters of like-for-like growth), margin improvement (operating margin up to 3.0% in H2), and strengthened balance sheet (net debt down 29.6%). The merger with Booker also offers a structural growth opportunity.\n\nForecasts:  \n\u2022 Expected **ROE** next year: Given the ongoing cost efficiencies, merger synergies (targeting PS200m recurring run-rate synergies within three years), and focus on margin improvement to between 3.5%-4.0% by FY 2019/20, Tesco\u2019s **ROE** is expected to continue to improve, potentially reaching double-digit levels next year, barring macroeconomic shocks.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Tesco\u2019s **ROE** turnaround from negative to positive (**-0.62%** to **9.45%**) signals a significant recovery in profitability and capital efficiency.  \n- Key drivers include cost reduction initiatives, sales growth, margin expansion, debt reduction, and the strategic merger with Booker.  \n- The improvement is sustainable given the medium-term ambitions and integration synergies, supporting positive shareholder returns and dividend growth prospects.  \n- Risks include challenging external conditions such as economic uncertainty and competitive pressures, which may temper near-term performance.",
      "Detailed Analysis of ROE Driver": "\u2022 Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?  \nAI answer: The growth in ROE is driven by increases in both **Asset Turnover** and **Profit Margin**, which is a very positive indication of improved operational efficiency and profitability.\n\n\u2022 Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?  \nAI answer: While specific competitor data is not provided here, the significant improvement in **Asset Turnover** from **3.63** to **4.23** and the turnaround in **Profit Margin** from a negative **-0.07%** to a positive **1.72%** suggest Tesco is strengthening both efficiency and profitability, likely positioning it favorably against peers in the retail sector.\n\nForecasts:  \n\u2022 Expected Asset Turnover next year: Given Tesco\u2019s focus on optimizing store operations, repurposing space, and expanding online and wholesale channels through the Booker merger, **Asset Turnover** is expected to maintain or modestly improve beyond the current **4.23** level.\n\n\u2022 Expected Profit Margin next year: With operating profit up 28.4%, margin improvement initiatives such as cost reductions of \u00a31.5bn target, and ongoing focus on own brand quality and pricing strategies, the **Profit Margin** is expected to continue its positive trajectory, potentially approaching the medium-term target margin range of 3.5% to 4.0%.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Both **Asset Turnover** and **Profit Margin** have improved markedly year-on-year, highlighting stronger operational efficiency and a return to profitability.  \n- The increase in **Asset Turnover** from **3.63** to **4.23** indicates more effective use of assets to generate sales, supported by store repurposing and digital growth.  \n- The shift from a negative to a positive **Profit Margin** (from -0.07% to 1.72%) signals significant margin recovery driven by cost savings, pricing discipline, and improved product mix.  \n- The combined improvement in these drivers suggests a robust and sustainable enhancement in ROE, with margin improvement being the more dominant driver given its dramatic turnaround.  \n- Looking forward, Tesco\u2019s strategic cost reduction and growth initiatives, including the Booker merger synergies, support expectations for continued margin expansion and stable or improved asset efficiency.",
      "Detailed Analysis of Risk": "\u2022 **Are risks increasing (bad sign) or declining (good sign)?** AI answer: Risks show a mixed profile. Financial risk (NLP financial risk) has increased from 1.05 to 1.16, indicating slightly higher perceived financial risk. Legal risk has notably increased from 0.07 to 0.20, signaling emerging or heightened legal concerns. Tax risk has marginally declined from 0.72 to 0.69, a positive sign. Overall, there is a modest increase in certain risk dimensions, particularly legal and financial risks.\n\n\u2022 **Is the number and severity of risks higher than that of competitors/industry (bad sign)?** AI answer: Without direct competitor data, it's difficult to conclusively compare. However, the rise in legal and financial risk indicators suggests Tesco may face higher risk levels than previously, which could be above industry norms if competitors show stable or declining risk levels.\n\n\u2022 **Is sentiment increasing (good sign) or declining (bad sign)?** AI answer: Sentiment measures are not explicitly provided, but the increase in financial and legal risks suggests a more cautious or negative sentiment in the risk disclosures.\n\n\u2022 **Is specificity increasing (good sign) or declining (bad sign)?** AI answer: Specificity has marginally increased from 0.09698 to 0.09717, a slight improvement indicating disclosures are somewhat more detailed and precise.\n\n\u2022 **Are complexity measures (sentence length, depth, and unfamiliarity) increasing (bad sign) or declining (good sign)?** AI answer: Sentence length has declined from 28.28 to 27.08 words, and sentence depth has slightly decreased from 6.53 to 6.45. This reduction in complexity suggests disclosures are becoming clearer and easier to understand, which is favorable for investor communication.\n\n\u2022 **How are sentiment, specificity, and complexity compared to those of competitors?** AI answer: Lacking competitor benchmarks, but the slight increase in specificity and decline in complexity indicate Tesco is improving disclosure quality relative to typical corporate reporting trends, potentially outperforming peers on transparency.\n\nForecasts:\n\n\u2022 **Is Gearing expected to increase next year?** AI answer: Gearing has improved significantly, declining from 4.48 to 2.52, reflecting reduced leverage and stronger balance sheet management. Given this trend and focus on debt reduction noted in the report, gearing is expected to remain stable or possibly decrease, not increase.\n\n\u2022 **Is Current Ratio expected to increase next year?** AI answer: The current ratio declined from 0.79 to 0.71, indicating a slight deterioration in short-term liquidity. Without indications of strategic liquidity improvements, it may remain stable or slightly improve if working capital initiatives succeed.\n\n\u2022 **Is Quick Ratio expected to increase next year?** AI answer: The quick ratio also declined from 0.37 to 0.27, showing tighter immediate liquidity. Similar to the current ratio, it may stabilize or modestly improve depending on working capital management but no strong evidence suggests a significant increase.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Financial and legal risks have moderately increased, signaling emerging challenges.\n- Tax risk shows slight improvement, reflecting effective tax risk management.\n- Gearing has improved substantially, indicating stronger financial health.\n- Short-term liquidity ratios (current and quick) have slightly declined, warranting monitoring.\n- Specificity of risk disclosures has marginally improved, enhancing transparency.\n- Complexity in language and sentence structure has decreased, aiding clarity.\n- Overall risk profile suggests cautious optimism with some new risk factors.\n- Disclosure quality is improving, supporting investor confidence.\n- Financial leverage trends are positive; liquidity ratios need attention.\n- Forward-looking focus should balance growth with risk mitigation and liquidity management.",
      "summary": "\u2022 **Key strength:** Significant turnaround in **ROE** from **-0.62%** to **9.45%**, reflecting strong recovery in profitability and equity efficiency.  \n\u2022 Both **Asset Turnover** (up to **4.23**) and **Profit Margin** (from **-0.07%** to **1.72%**) have improved, driving sustainable ROE growth through enhanced operational efficiency and margin expansion.  \n\u2022 Robust cost reduction initiatives (\u00a31.5bn target) and strategic merger with Booker support ongoing margin improvement and asset utilization.  \n\u2022 **Gearing** has improved markedly from **4.48** to **2.52**, indicating strengthened financial health and reduced leverage risk.  \n\u2022 Slight declines in **Current Ratio** (to **0.71**) and **Quick Ratio** (to **0.27**) suggest short-term liquidity tightening, warranting close monitoring.  \n\u2022 Financial and legal risks have moderately increased (e.g., financial risk from 1.05 to 1.16, legal risk from 0.07 to 0.20), introducing new cautionary factors for investors.  \n\u2022 Risk disclosure quality is improving, with increased specificity and reduced complexity, enhancing transparency and investor confidence.  \n\u2022 Absence of competitor data limits precise benchmarking, but Tesco\u2019s operational and financial improvements likely outpace many peers in the UK retail sector.  \n\u2022 **Expected ROE** for next year is confidently forecasted to reach double-digit levels, supported by synergy realization and margin targets of 3.5%-4.0%.  \n\u2022 Overall, Tesco presents a strong recovery story with positive momentum, balanced by emerging risks and liquidity considerations."

We have taken important decisions to help our customers through the year - from reformulating thousands of products to reduce salt, fat and sugar, to launching great value exclusive food brands. Thanks to these efforts, our offer is more competitive, and more customers are shopping at Tesco as a result. At the same time, we are also focused on new opportunities for growth. Most significantly, our merger with Booker allows us to become the UK's leading food business. This report sets out what we have achieved in the year, and gives an update on our medium-term ambitions - our six strategic drivers. We are making strong progress, and firmly believe that by serving shoppers a little better every day, the momentum in our business will continue. Serving shoppers a little better every day. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 2 Introduction 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. Following completion of the merger, I am delighted to welcome two new Directors to the Board: Charles Wilson and Stewart Gilliland. Charles has been appointed to the role of CEO for our retail and wholesale operations in the UK & ROI, while Stewart has joined the Board as a Non-executive Director. Both Charles and Stewart bring substantial levels of experience and expertise, and I know that our business will benefit greatly from their talents. I would also like to take the opportunity here to welcome the very many new shareholders in Tesco, who took up our shares as part of the merger. I look forward to meeting many of you over the coming months, and to hearing your views. Throughout the year, the Board has dedicated significant time to overseeing the merger process, as well as continuing its close involvement in matters of strategy. The Board has also supported the development of our corporate responsibility strategy for the Group, which culminated in the launch of the Little Helps Plan in October 2017. The plan sets out how we will make a positive contribution to our colleagues, customers and communities - as a sustainable business that also takes a lead on issues of societal importance, such as health and tackling food waste. More details on the Little Helps Plan, and the commitments we have made, can be found starting on page 16 of the Strategic report. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to every colleague at Tesco. I firmly believe that the retail industry, and Tesco in particular, have an important role in helping people to develop fulfilling and successful careers. Almost a quarter of our most senior leaders began their careers in stores and, as I travel around our business, I am constantly impressed by the calibre and experience of the colleagues I meet, from a very diverse range of backgrounds. Tesco is a powerful engine of social mobility, and creating opportunities for colleagues to get on in their careers is a focus for us at every level of our business. It is our colleagues' dedication, and relentless focus on doing the right thing for our customers, that has enabled us to build the strong platform we have today. I am confident that the Board and management team have the right plans in place to build from that platform and continue to grow. That will be our collective focus for the coming year, and beyond, as we create long-term value for every stakeholder in our business. John Allan Non-executive Chairman We have made substantial progress this year, as we position our business for new growth. The management team has built solid foundations - and operating profit before exceptional items for the Group is up 28.4% to PS1,644m 2016 17: PS1,280m, with statutory profit before tax of PS1,298m 2016 17: PS145m. This greatly improved performance has also allowed us to make a return to paying dividends, for the first time since 2014. The decision to reinstate the dividend was a particularly important one, and reflects the conviction that the Board and I have in Dave and his team, and the progress we are seeing. So it is from this strong position that we also look ahead to the new opportunities presented by our merger with Booker Group. Shortly after the end of our financial year, and following regulatory and shareholder approval, we completed that merger. Work is already well underway to unlock the substantial synergies that are now available to the combined Group. Bringing together knowledge and skills from across retail and wholesale is both allowing us to trial innovative new concepts and to move faster with existing strategies, for example in rapidly growing the fresh food offer available to Booker's customers. ' I would like to pay tribute to every colleague at Tesco. ' John Allan Non-executive Chairman A platform for growth. com ar2018 to hear more from John Allan. Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 3 Chairman's statement 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. This has been another significant year for our business. After three years of turnaround, the results we'five shared for this year show that we are firmly on track, and delivering on our commitments. I am pleased with the progress we have made, and excited by the opportunities ahead. We have seen nine consecutive quarters of sales growth in our core UK business, with Group sales up 2.3% for the year. Group operating profit before exceptional items is up 28.4% to PS1,644m 2016 17: PS1,280m, and we are generating more cash - with Retail operating cash flow up 21.7% to PS2.8bn 2016 17: PS2.3bn. We are also making good progress towards the margin ambition we set out in October 2016, with Group operating margin reaching 3.0% in the second half of the year. At the same time, we have strengthened our balance sheet, with Net debt down 29.6% to PS2.6bn 2016 17: PS3.7bn. The external environment remains challenging: consumers are feeling the impact of economic uncertainty, and the pressures I described in last year's Annual Report, such as business rates in the UK and competitive market conditions in Central Europe, have not eased. However, the journey we are on to simplify and grow our business puts us in a strong position to deal with these challenges. By keeping our focus, we are creating value for our customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders. Customers We are helping customers in the areas that matter most to them, and bringing them more sustainable, affordable, healthy food. As a result, our net promoter score has increased by 5 points as more customers recommend Tesco as a place to shop: loyalty is growing, and in the UK 260,000 more shoppers are shopping at Tesco. In the first half of the year, we took a strategic decision to protect our customers and hold back the inflationary pressure we were seeing in the rest of the UK market. We'five also looked at other ways to add value for our customers, with a series of little helps through the year, including: - covering the cost of the 'tampon tax' on women's sanitary products in the UK: - removing barriers to eating healthily with our 'little helps to healthier living' campaign in the UK, and taking 4,100 tonnes of sugar out of our Own Brand soft drinks in Central Europe: - launching our Clubcard app in Thailand, making it easier for customers to manage their points: - passing on an interest rate increase to savers at Tesco Bank, following the Bank of England's base rate rise in November: and - running regular 'Weekly Little Helps' in the UK, helping customers save money on everything from fresh food to fuel. As a business with food at our heart, improving our Own Brand food ranges is a particularly important part of our plans. This year we have relaunched many of these ranges - bringing our customers the best quality products at the very best prices. We have looked at each of the three tiers of our Own Brand offer - 'good', 'better' and 'best' - and are strengthening some brands, like our Tesco core range, and redesigning others, like Tesco finest. Where our customers want the best value, without any compromise on quality, we are adding to our range of entry-level brands that are exclusively available at Tesco. New brands we have launched for Tesco customers include prepared meals, pasta and sauces from the Hearty Food Co. and bakery products from H. W. Nevill's. As part of this work, we have already relaunched 1,300 products in the year, with thousands more to follow - and our brand perception measures of quality and value have both increased. Colleagues The improvements we are making to our business are driven by our colleagues, as they serve our shoppers a little better every day. This year, we announced a 10.5% increase in hourly pay for our UK store colleagues over the next two years, and our Colleague Bonus Plan continues to reward colleagues in the UK for their contribution to our turnaround. ' I'm pleased with the progress we have made, and excited by the opportunities ahead. ' Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive Delivering on our commitments. com ar2018 to hear more from Dave Lewis. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 4 Group Chief Executive's statement 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. indb 4 20 04 2018 15:42 Some of the changes we have made to simplify our business have had a significant impact on colleagues, including the closure of our Customer Engagement Centre in Cardiff, and changes to our operational structures in stores, and I am grateful for the professionalism and integrity of our colleagues at these difficult times. Over the summer, we also began to move to a new service model in our offices in the UK, followed by similar changes in Central Europe, in order to simplify the way we organise ourselves, reduce duplication and cost, and invest in serving shoppers better. In a simpler business, it's particularly important that we still do everything we can to help colleagues develop their careers as they wish, and this year we have continued our apprenticeship programme in the UK, as well as running a Career Academy in our Thai business, for around 150 students. We're also committed to building a team which is diverse, and reflects the communities we serve. We continue to develop an inclusive culture at every level of our organisation, helping our colleagues with the flexibility, skills and reward they need to get on. Suppliers With our suppliers, we are building even closer partnerships, working together to deliver great quality products for our customers and grow our mutual businesses. Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 5 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. indb 5 20 04 2018 15:42 In our most recent anonymous Supplier Viewpoint survey, 83% of our UK & ROI suppliers say they are treated fairly, and 94% say we pay promptly - and for the second year running, we topped the independently-run supplier Advantage Survey. By growing our business with our closest product partners, we have been able to launch new and exclusive products for our customers, and support our suppliers to invest in innovation. This year we have worked with our partners to launch new products including our Wicked Kitchen vegan range in the UK, Eat Fresh produce brand in Malaysia, and an extended Free From range in Central Europe. One example of particularly close partnership is our Tesco Sustainable Dairy Group, which has now paid an extra PS300m to farmers above the market price of milk since it launched - helping them to manage the volatility in milk price experienced by the dairy industry. The group also incentivises our farmers to focus on quality, sustainability and productivity - and following this success, we have set up similar groups for other agricultural products including potatoes, lamb, poultry and eggs. I'm also pleased that 25 of our largest food suppliers have agreed to join us in tackling food waste, by committing to targets on waste, publishing their data, and acting to stop good food going to waste. Shareholders With our business growing again, we resumed the payment of dividends to our shareholders this year - after a three-year absence while we stabilised our business. We remain firmly on track to deliver the mediumterm ambitions we set out in October 2016: to reduce our costs by PS1.5bn, generate PS9bn of retail cash from operations and improve operating margins to between 3.5% and 4.0% by 2019 20. By maintaining a disciplined approach to capital, and further reducing our debt - already down from PS 8.5 bn in 2014 15 to PS 2.6 bn today - we can continue to strengthen our balance sheet and return to investment grade credit metrics. Our underlying philosophy for creating sustainable value for shareholders places increasing focus on cash profitability, free cash flow and earnings growth. An important driver of this growth will come from the benefits of our merger with Booker, which we completed on 5 March 2018. The combined business allows us to access new growth areas, and provide food wherever it is prepared or eaten - 'in home' or 'out of home'. As a result of the merger, I am also delighted to welcome Charles Wilson to the Executive team and Board as our UK & ROI CEO, responsible for both retail and wholesale. A sustainable business It is critically important that as our business delivers growth, we do so in a way which is sustainable. In October 2017, we published our Little Helps Plan, which sets out how we will: - create a business where colleagues can get on, whatever their background: - help our customers make healthier choices and enjoy good quality, sustainable products, at affordable prices: and - help make sure no food that could be eaten is wasted, anywhere in our supply chain. More detail on our performance, including statutory results, can be found in our Financial review on page 12. UK food market: food consumed 'in home' PS110bn UK food market: food consumed 'out of home' PS85bn Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 6 Group Chief Executive's statement continued 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. indb 6 20 04 2018 15:42 We have made good progress in all of these areas this year, and you can read more on pages 16 to 21 of this report. I'm particularly proud of our efforts to stop good food going to waste - in the UK we have donated 19 million meals from surplus this year to help feed people in need, with a further 2 million and 25 million meals from our businesses in the Republic of Ireland and Central Europe respectively. Looking ahead With our business focused on growth, we will continue to deliver on the same plans for Tesco - our six strategic drivers - that have served us well in our turnaround so far. At the same time, we will begin to deliver the substantial synergies that our merger with Booker unlocks: bringing benefits to consumers and colleagues, creating a wider market opportunity for our suppliers and new career opportunities for our colleagues - as well as accelerating the growth of our combined business for shareholders. In what has been a very significant year, I am grateful to every colleague in our business for everything they have done to keep serving shoppers better. It is their dedication and talent which drives all of our plans, and I look forward to continuing our work together as we grow the UK's leading food business. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive For example, our trial of a new Chef Central format is well underway, with a first store in Bar Hill, Cambridge selling products in bulk to professional caterers and the public alongside our existing Tesco Extra store. And, where it's right for our customers, we are offering catering-format products in a number of Tesco stores too. These are just the early stages of the many exciting opportunities in front of us. As we look ahead, our combination of businesses uniquely positions us to better serve the large and growing food market in the UK. The combined Tesco and Booker business allows us to bring together the retail and wholesale expertise of our two businesses, and access new opportunities for growth. Together we employ over 310,000 colleagues in the UK, serve 117,000 independent retailers, 441,000 catering businesses, 641,000 small businesses, and work with over 7,000 suppliers. Through our merger, we will bring benefits to customers, suppliers, colleagues and shareholders: - We will delight consumers with better availability of quality food at attractive prices across retail and eating out locations, and serve better the faster growing 'out of home' food market. - We will help independent retailers, caterers and small businesses by further improving choice, price and service, with enhanced digital and delivery service options. - And for our suppliers, we will create a broader market opportunity, with strong growth prospects and a clear opportunity to develop better own brand and fresh ranges. As our two businesses join forces, we are already beginning to deliver benefits. Importantly, there is no lengthy integration process, as we want to keep the complementary skills of retail and wholesale in our business, and start accessing growth opportunities as quickly as possible. Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 7 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. A differentiated brand A strong and differentiated brand creates long-term value for every stakeholder in our business. Our purpose, to serve shoppers a little better every day, is at the heart of what our brand stands for. Over the last year, we have continued to build trust, and have seen a 5 point improvement in customer recommendations of our brand. We continue to focus on products and services which make the Tesco offer unique, and this year we have relaunched our core and finest food ranges, as well as introducing new brands which are exclusive to Tesco, such as our Hearty Food Co. ready meals, and our Fox & Ivy homeware. Food quality is a particularly powerful driver of supermarket choice, so strengthening customer perceptions of our food is a priority. Our Food Love Stories campaign has continued this year, celebrating the food our customers love to make, for the people they love - and helping increase customer perceptions of quality at Tesco, up 2.7 points year-on-year. But the way customers feel about our brand is defined by more than just our products: it's also about how we respond to the issues that matter to them, from healthy eating to reducing plastic packaging - and the value that Tesco creates for society. In May 2017, we held our first ever health month for colleagues and customers, including helpful 'little swaps' with products that are lower in saturated fat, salt and sugar, and recorded our highest ever score for customers saying that Tesco helps them lead healthier lives. Reduce operating costs by PS1.5bn We continue to simplify our business and reduce costs, with in-year savings of PS594m - and PS820m of savings to date towards our PS1.5bn ambition. We have reviewed every aspect of our operation to identify opportunities for savings - with a particular focus on our store operating model, where we have delivered PS541m of savings: logistics and distribution, with PS104m of savings: and goods not for resale, where we have made savings of PS174m. We continue to encourage a cost-conscious culture, finding savings so that we can reinvest for the benefit of customers. We have also simplified the shopping experience for customers, at the same time as reducing costs, for example by increasing availability of our Scan As You Shop self-scan handsets - now in over 500 UK stores and beginning to roll out in Central Europe - and making till receipts optional in our smaller stores, which has generated savings of around PS3m. We have also made strong progress in reducing the costs of procuring goods and services not for resale, finding synergies across the Group. In particular, we have improved our services in facilities management, freight and media services, while also delivering savings of PS50m. Generate PS9bn cash from operations Our focus on free cash generation continues, and Retail cash generated from operations increased by PS495m to PS2,773m this year, driven by improved profitability and strong working capital management. One example of our work is in reducing stockholding, by improving the way we receive deliveries from our suppliers. To minimise our environmental impact, and reduce transport costs, we order full trucks of products from suppliers whenever we can - which sometimes means 'rounding up' an order. However, by analysing our orders forensically, we have been able to sort stock between trucks and identify where we can eliminate a truck. This removes unnecessary journeys for our suppliers, and allows us to take out unnecessary 'rounded' stock. Because we are ordering only what's needed to ensure great availability, our customers can buy what they want, and we can order less. Our six strategic drivers will create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. An update on our six strategic drivers. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 8 The six strategic drivers 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. Maximise the mix to achieve a 3.5% - 4.0% margin To achieve our 3.5% - 4.0% margin ambition by our 2019 20 financial year, we continue to build sustainable profitability across our businesses, channels and product ranges. By carefully managing the combination of volume, mix and cost-effectiveness in our business, Group operating margin for this year was 2.9% - up 57 basis points. In Asia, our margin has grown to 6.0%, as we have stepped back from unprofitable bulk selling in Thailand. This was a deliberate decision that we took at the start of the year, allowing us to focus on serving our core retail customers better, and increase profitability. In our online business, we are improving the economics of our offer, while giving customers greater choice and flexibility. For example, we have extended our delivery saver subscription service, to introduce new monthly plans - offering a great value option to our most loyal customers. We have also extended our Click & Collect options - including same-day collection - with slots at a range of prices so that customers can choose the service most convenient to them. Maximise value from property Our property portfolio across the Group is significant, and we are looking at opportunities to better use our space for the benefit of customers, while also releasing value where it's the right thing to do for our business. Over the last three years, we have released a cumulative PS1.4bn of value from property proceeds, at the same time as increasing our proportion of freehold property in the UK & ROI from 41% to 52%. In the UK, we are exploring a small number of opportunities to work with a third-party to re-develop our store sites in high-value locations. Our Hackney store in London is one such example, where we have sold the site for a mixed-use development - allowing us to release value, while still retaining a store on the new site and with continuity of trade throughout. We can also create value for our customers by using space in new ways, as we repurpose space in our larger stores - and this year, we have repurposed 1.1m sq. In Central Europe, we have worked with partners to bring a new offer to customers in a number of our stores - and this year, across the region, we opened ten shop units with H&M, and three with Decathlon. Innovation To serve our shoppers a little better every day, it's important we listen and respond to their needs, with innovation across every aspect of our offer, and a strong pipeline of ideas to come to market. We have innovated in our product ranges - for example, with the launch of our exclusive Wicked Kitchen range of plant-based dishes, including new ingredients and exotic preparations such as carrot 'pastrami' and eryngii mushroom 'bolognese'. The range responds to increasing demand for vegetarian and vegan food, and since its January launch has proved extremely popular with customers. As customers look for increasingly convenient options to do their shopping, this year we became the first retailer in the UK to offer same-day grocery deliveries nationwide, and in London - through our Tesco Now app - we can deliver within an hour.

A detailed analysis of discontinued operations can be found in Note 7. This was another strong performance for Tesco with results ahead of expectations. We grew sales by 0.6%, excluding VAT, excluding fuel, at constant exchange rates and experienced like-for-like sales growth of 0.7%. Group operating profit before exceptional items was PS1,644m, up 28.4% on last year as we significantly strengthened our profitability, remaining firmly on track to deliver our medium-term ambitions. Our statutory profit before tax increased to PS1,298m including PS155m of exceptional items. We generated retail operating cash flow of PS2.8bn, up 21.7% on last year, driven by the strong improvement in our operating profit. We reduced net debt excluding Tesco Bank by 29.6% to PS 2.6 bn. We are well placed to deliver our ambition of a Group operating margin of 3.5%-4.0% by the 2019 20 financial year. This ambition is underpinned by six strategic drivers, including the PS1.5bn operating cost reductions which we are on track to secure, having delivered cumulative savings of PS820m to date. Reflecting our improved performance and confidence in future prospects, the Board has proposed the payment of a 2.0 pence per share final dividend following on from the interim dividend of 1.0 pence per share. We expect dividends to grow towards a target cover of around two times earnings per share over the medium term.

In the UK, like-for-like sales growth of 2.2% includes our ninth consecutive quarter of positive performance, despite an ongoing drag of 0.4 % from general merchandise as we take action to fide-emphasise certain categories. We delivered a consistently strong performance in fresh food, outperforming the market in volume terms. During the fourth quarter we experienced some distribution-related disruption, following the administration of Palmer & Harvey, resulting in lost tobacco sales across December. Despite these challenges, which are now behind us, we continued to deliver positive sales momentum through the fourth quarter. Market conditions have remained challenging with continued cost price inflation. We have worked hard with our supplier partners throughout the year to mitigate price increases wherever possible, and made a significant investment in the first half to further hold back inflation and protect customers. We have continued to reduce promotional participation over the year, focusing instead on consistently offering the best value for customers on all of our products. Our own brand ranges have performed very well, with like-for-like sales growing 4.2% year-on-year. We have embarked on a re-launch of over 10,000 own brand products, across our entry, core and finest ranges, with the initial focus on ready meals and Italian products. Our new, exclusive Hearty Food Co. range of ready meals and improved core Tesco products have proved particularly popular, contributing to an increase in overall own brand participation of nearly one percent. We have continued to refine our general merchandise range, reducing SKUs by 16%, as we focus on categories with more sustainable profitability. We have delivered 2.7% sales growth in our home category, following the launch of our new own brand Go Cook and Fox & Ivy ranges. These new brands have driven a 14% and 20% increase in customers to our cook and homeware ranges, respectively. Clothing performed well during the year with like-for-like sales growth of 2.6%, reflecting the strength of the F&F brand and quality of our range. All store formats and channels have achieved like-for-like growth, with our large store business growing at 1.9% and our online grocery sales growing 5.1% with both higher order numbers and increased average basket size. In ROI, like-for-like sales grew by 2.7%, improving steadily throughout the year as customers responded well to an even more competitive price position. The main driver of growth was a 4.2% increase in volume, ahead of market volume growth. Fresh food volumes were particularly strong, growing by 5.2% year-on-year.

Our efforts to reduce operating costs and improve efficiencies across our store estate and head office have delivered a significant increase in profitability, particularly during the second half when our operating margin reached 2.5%, up 67 basis points year-on-year. Further progress on maximising the mix within our business and driving volume more selectively, particularly in general merchandise, has aided margin expansion.

Our focus on improving the quality and breadth of the range in our stores has delivered positive results with fresh food sales growth of 1.2%. However, this growth was held back by declines in general merchandise and clothing. Our convenience formats delivered positive like-for-like growth across all countries. We have continued to exit from unprofitable stores in the region, with 28 store closures contributing to an overall sales reduction of 1.6 % at constant exchange rates. Legislative changes in the region are affecting our business, with Poland phasing in a gradual ban on Sunday trading from March 2018, which takes complete effect by 2020. Central Europe operating profit before exceptional items was PS119m, up PS61m year-on-year at actual exchange rates. We have made continued progress towards operating the four markets we serve as one combined region, helping to improve our customer offer. In the first half of the year we opened a new distribution centre in Galanta, Slovakia serving all four countries and benefiting from the best local practices in the region. The resulting benefits of more effective stock management combined with our other efforts on cost savings have more than offset the impact of inflation on the cost base and enabled us to improve profitability.

Adjusting for this impact, underlying like-for-like sales in the region were down 1.0 %, largely reflecting the deflationary effect of lowering our fresh food prices for customers. Asia operating profit before exceptional items was PS299m, up 7.6% at constant exchange rates and up 14.1% at actual exchange rates. This improvement has been driven by refocusing on our core retail offer and continuing to reduce our cost base as part of the Group's overall cost savings programme.

Throughout the year, the Bank has continued to strengthen its product and service offering to customers, delivering growth of 4.1% in active customer account numbers across its primary products. During the year, we completed the roll-out of Tesco Pay, the Group's digital wallet offering, to every one of our stores in the UK. In July 2017, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of the launch of our mortgage product, which has now reached PS3.0bn in balances. Operating profit before exceptional items increased by 10.2% year-on-year to PS173m. Lending growth in the year has been strong, driven by secured mortgage lending which now comprises 26% of the lending portfolio, versus 22% last year. In addition, Money Services products such as our Travel Money offer have performed well overall as the Group continues to enhance the product range and expand the customer base. Exceptional items of PS 24 m relating to Tesco Bank include an increase in the provision for customer redress and a credit received following the conclusion of negotiations with a third party in respect of previously recognised customer redress. The balance sheet remains strong and well-positioned to support future lending growth from both a liquidity and capital perspective with a risk asset ratio of 19.3%.

In the current year, the net effect of exceptional items on operating profit is PS193m. Net restructuring and redundancy charges of PS 102 m relate principally to structural changes to our business to simplify our operating model within stores and head office. The net impairment reversal of non-current assets and onerous lease provisions of PS53m includes a net reversal of PS185m in property, plant and equipment and investment property, a net PS 24 m charge in software and other intangible assets and a net charge of PS 108 m of onerous lease provisions. Provision for customer redress of PS 24 m relating to Tesco Bank, includes an increase of PS 35 m in the provision for Payment Protection Insurance PPI, partially offset by a PS1m Consumer Credit Act CCA provision release and a credit of PS10m received following the conclusion of negotiations with a third party in respect of previously recognised customer redress. The investment disposal profit of PS124m reflects the sale of our remaining minority stake in the Lazada e-commerce platform, completed during the first half. The sale of our opticians business in the UK & ROI to Vision Express resulted in a PS38m gain on disposal. 13 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic report 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. indb 13 20 04 2018 15:42 Two property-related transactions completed in the UK in the first half of the year account for the majority of the PS79m property transactions within exceptional items. In the prior year, we took an exceptional charge of PS 235 m in respect of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement DPA between Tesco Stores Limited and the UK Serious Fraud Office SFO regarding historic accounting practices and an agreement with the UK Financial Conduct Authority FCA of a finding of market abuse in relation to the Tesco PLC trading statement announced on 29 August 2014. Included in this charge was PS 85 m for the Shareholder Compensation Scheme. With the Compensation Scheme now being closed to new claimants, we have released PS25m of the amounts provided. Outstanding claims submitted before the 22 February 2018 deadline are still being processed. Joint ventures and associates, interest and tax Joint ventures and associates Our share of post-tax losses from joint ventures and associates before exceptional items was PS 6 m, an improvement of PS24m year-on-year due to reduced losses recognised in Gain Land, our joint venture in China. There were no exceptional items this year relating to our share of post-tax losses from joint ventures and associates. Finance income and costs 2017 18 2016 17 Interest payable on medium term notes, loans and bonds PS 363 m PS 434 m Interest receivable on associated derivatives PS31m PS6m Net interest on medium term notes, loans and bonds PS 332 m PS 428 m Other interest receivable and similar income PS44m PS42m Other finance charges and interest payable PS 70 m PS 89 m Capitalised interest PS2m PS6m Net finance cost before exceptional charges, IAS 19 net pension finance costs and IAS 39 fair value remeasurements PS 356 m PS 469 m IAS 39 fair value remeasurements PS23m PS61m IAS 19 net pension finance costs PS 162 m PS 113 m Exceptional charge - translation of Korea proceeds PS 38 m PS 244 m Net finance costs PS 533 m PS 765 m Net finance costs before exceptional charges, IAS 19 net pension finance costs and IAS 39 fair value remeasurements reduced by PS113m year-on-year to PS 356 m. This 24.1% decline year-on-year was mainly driven by a net PS96m reduction in interest on interest-bearing liabilities. Debt maturities totalled PS1.4bn during the year and we also undertook PS1.3bn of bond tenders in two separate liability management exercises. These bond tenders during the year contributed to PS23m lower interest costs and we expect an associated reduction in interest payable of c. PS50m on an annualised basis. In cash interest terms, we were helped by a favourable timing benefit of PS55m on our largest sterling-denominated bond, for which no annual coupon payment was made during the year owing to the timing of our year-end date. Net finance costs, which include non-cash items, were around 30% lower year-on-year. Fair value remeasurements are largely driven by changes in the market assessment of credit risk and various market indices which can fluctuate significantly. Net pension finance costs increased by PS 49 m year-on-year driven by a higher opening pension deficit part offset by a lower opening discount rate. Net pension finance costs are calculated by multiplying the opening deficit by the opening discount rate each year. For 2018 19, they are expected to decrease to c. PS 95 m as the impact of a higher opening discount rate is more than offset by the year-on-year reduction in deficit. The exceptional charge of PS 38 m relating to the translation of the remaining proceeds from the sale of our business in Korea will not arise again since the funds have now been moved to a Sterling denominated entity within the Group. The proceeds had been held in GBP money market funds in a non-Sterling denominated subsidiary and the translation effect represents no economic cost to the Group. Group tax Tax on profit before exceptional items was PS 286 m, with an effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items for the Group of 25.0%. As previously indicated, this tax rate is higher than the UK statutory rate primarily due to the depreciation of assets that do not qualify for tax relief and the impact of the 8% supplementary tax surcharge on bank profits. We expect the impact of these items on the effective tax rate to reduce as our overall level of profitability continues to increase, and therefore we expect the effective tax rate to reduce to around 20% in the medium term. The effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items for the 2018 19 financial year is expected to be around 24%. Earnings per share on a continuing operations basis Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items were 11.88p, nearly 63% higher year-on-year principally due to our stronger profit performance. Statutory basic earnings per share from continuing operations were 12.12p, up from 0.81p last year. Summary of total indebtedness 2017 18 2016 17 Movement Net debt excludes Tesco Bank PS 2,625 m PS 3,729 m PS1,104m Discounted operating lease commitments PS 6,931 m PS 7,440 m PS509m Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax PS 2,728 m PS 5,504 m PS2,776m Total indebtedness PS 12,284 m PS 16,673 m PS4,389m Retail net debt reduced by PS1.1bn to PS 2.6 bn as retail operating cash flow and disposal proceeds were greater than capital expenditure and other charges. Within net debt, we used surplus cash to prepay PS1.3bn of the Group's long-dated bonds as part of an ongoing focus to strengthen the balance sheet. We have a strong funding and liquidity profile underpinned by PS4.2bn committed facilities and our key credit metrics, fixed charge cover and total indebtedness EBITDAR, have improved to 2.7 times and 3.3 times respectively. Discounted operating lease commitments have reduced by PS509m, including the benefit from the buyback of 17 stores in the UK during the year. We anticipate rental savings of PS26m on an annualised basis as a result of these property purchases. On an IAS 19 basis, the pension deficit measure net of deferred tax has reduced from PS5.5bn last year to PS2.7bn at the end of the current year. The movement during the year was partly driven by an increase in yields on corporate bonds, which drive the discount rate used for accounting purposes and our decision at the half-year stage to update the discount rate model in line with developing market practice and following actuarial advice. In the Group's view, it now more appropriately reflects expected yields on corporate bonds over the life of the scheme's liabilities. At the same time, the application of latest industry life expectancy tables and favourable actual scheme experience have also contributed to the reduction. During the year, the triennial pension review was concluded, with the business and the Trustees agreeing that annual contributions will increase by PS15m to PS285m per annum from April 2018, with our framework for the long-term funding of the scheme unchanged. As at 31 March 2017, the actuarial deficit was PS3.0bn, an increase of c. PS0.25bn since the last triennial valuation. Overall, total indebtedness has reduced by PS4.4bn in the year. Net debt has reduced by almost PS6bn over the last three years. Summary retail cash flow Retail operating cash flow increased by PS495m to PS2,773m in the year. This increase of 21.7% year-on-year, was mainly driven by improved Group profitability. Further improvements in working capital of PS499m also contributed to the improvement in cash flow, although this includes PS102m of timing benefits principally as a consequence of the failure of a supplier towards the end of the year. Exceptional cash items increased year-on-year, largely driven by a cash outflow of PS149m relating to payment of the SFO fine and initial Shareholder Compensation Scheme payments. We expect a further cash outflow of c. PS60m relating to such claims. Other cash exceptional items totalling PS169m include a PS160m VAT refund from HMRC regarding the treatment of VAT on Clubcard rewards, which HMRC have appealed. This has no net effect in the Group income statement. Cash capital expenditure of PS 1.2 bn was up year-on-year due to the timing of payments relating to commitments made towards the end of the last financial year. Combined net cash interest and tax of PS 428 m was PS113m lower than last year largely as a result of debt maturities and bond tenders. We generated PS253m of proceeds from property sales and completed the buyback of 17 stores during the year, for a cash consideration of PS393m.

Finally, cash inflows of PS362m relating to disposals and dividends received includes consideration of PS196m from the sale of our remaining minority stake in the Lazada online business, a dividend of PS50m from Tesco Bank, and proceeds of PS45m relating to the disposal of our opticians business in the UK to Vision Express, in addition to a number of smaller transactions. Retail free cash flow of PS1,377m is up 7.0% year-on-year. This is lower than the rate of growth in retail operating cash flow principally due to timing of cash capital expenditure and lower property proceeds. Capital expenditure 2017 18 2016 17 UK & ROI PS676m PS731m Central Europe PS133m PS141m Asia PS239m PS261m Tesco Bank PS50m PS46m Group PS1,098m PS1,179m On an accrued basis, capital expenditure excluding buybacks of PS1.1bn was PS0.1bn lower than last year reflecting our disciplined approach to capital spending and focus on delivering attractive returns. Our capital expenditure in the UK focused on maintaining and replacing essential assets, alongside programmes to refresh and repurpose the estate, enhancing our store operations. New store capex has mainly been allocated to our new store opening programme in Thailand, with a limited number of Express store openings and a net gain of one new superstore in the UK. Our capital expenditure in Central Europe relates mainly to repurposing of existing stores. We expect capital expenditure to remain within a range of PS1.1bn-PS1.4bn. There was a net reduction of 1.2 m square feet, including 1.1 m square feet of space repurposed to a range of complementary partners such as Arcadia Group and H&M. Across the Group, our repurposing programme has focused on improving the ease and relevance of our large-store shopping trip for customers. In the UK & ROI, we have repurposed 75,000 square feet across 20 stores. Within the year, we opened over 50 concessions within our stores including Arcadia Group, Holland & Barrett, Dixons Carphone and Next. A brand new Booker 'Chef Central' concept store was also opened within the Tesco Extra store at Bar Hill, Cambridge in February 2018. The store primarily serves professional caterers but is open to all customers. In Central Europe, we have primarily been partnering with other clothing brands in repurposed store space including H&M and Decathlon. In Asia, we have worked with a range of different partners across a variety of brands including MR. DIY and Major Cineplex. Property The estimated market value of our fully owned property has increased by PS0.8bn to PS20.7bn, with a surplus of PS2.5bn over the net book value NBV. Our Group freehold property ownership percentage, by value, has increased to 58% from 57% last year, driven by the UK & ROI. We regained ownership of 17 stores in the UK during the year, increasing our proportion of freehold ownership by value in the UK & ROI to 52%. This repurchase of stores will result in an annualised rental saving of PS26m. We continue to seek opportunities to further reduce our exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift rent inflation where the economics are attractive. Dividend We propose to pay a final dividend of 2.0 pence per ordinary share. The proposed final dividend was approved by the Board of Directors on 10 April 2018 and is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 15 June 2018. This takes the total dividend for the year to 3.0 pence per ordinary share following the payment of an interim dividend of 1.0 pence per ordinary share in November 2017. We anticipate a split of broadly one-third to two-thirds between next year's interim and final dividends and intend to reach our targeted cover of around two times earnings in the medium term. Merger with Booker Group We completed our merger with Booker Group on 5 March 2018, after the end of the Tesco financial year. Our ' Joining Forces' integration programme is well underway and we are focused on delivering the PS200m recurring run-rate synergies identified during the merger process by the end of the third year post-completion. Booker Q4 results show a continued strong performance, with customer satisfaction up 0.3% to 85.7% and like-for-like sales up 9.9%. While Booker's full year results are still subject to audit approval, operating profit before exceptional items for the financial year to 30 March 2018 is c. PS195m and net cash is c. PS120m. Transaction costs of PS 26 m relating to our merger with Booker were included in Tesco's UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items in the 2016 17 financial year. Further costs and fees of PS 21 m arising in the 2017 18 financial year have been treated in a consistent fashion. A similar amount, consisting of stamp duty costs directly arising from the completion of the merger, will be charged to underlying profit in the 2018 19 financial year. As outlined in our merger prospectus, we anticipate up to PS 145 m of integration costs over three years, which will be treated as exceptional. Looking ahead We remain firmly on track to deliver the medium-term ambitions we set out in October 2016: to reduce our costs by PS1.5bn, to generate PS9bn of retail cash from operations and to improve operating margins to between 3.5% and 4.0% by 2019 20. In addition, by further reducing debt and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital we can continue to strengthen the balance sheet and generate an increasing level of free cash flow. Our intention remains to return to an investment grade credit rating, with our key metrics being fixed charge cover and total indebtedness EBITDAR. The integration of Booker is well underway and we are focused on delivering the identified synergies to create value for all stakeholders. We anticipate a synergy benefit of c. PS60m in the first year, growing to a cumulative c. PS140m in the second year and reaching a recurring run-rate of c. PS200m per year by the end of the third year. As we look to capitalise on the enhanced opportunities for growth available to the combined Group, we will place increasing focus on growth in earnings and free cash flow generation, in order to deliver strong, sustainable returns for shareholders.

The Little Helps Plan outlines how Tesco works in partnership with others, including suppliers, NGOs, governments and other retailers, to make a positive contribution and work towards shared global ambitions. The plan builds on the progress we have made so far and covers three areas core to the long-term success of our business: people, products and places. In October 2017, we shared targets and actions under each of these three pillars. More information on these can be found at www. The Little Helps Plan covers our retail businesses in the UK, Republic of Ireland, Central Europe and Asia. However, with the majority of our customers being in the UK, implementation of the plan and reporting will begin with the UK business. We have committed to sharing our progress along the way and will next update in October 2018. Accountability for the Little Helps Plan is led at an Executive level by Jane Lawrie, Group Communications Director, and at the Board level by Dave Lewis, Group Chief Executive. Our Corporate Responsibility Committee, chaired by Lindsey Pownall, Non-executive Director, governs the plan. More information on the activities of the Corporate Responsibility Committee can be found in the Corporate governance report on page 39. Our approach 'Every little help makes a big difference' is our third value and emphasises our belief that small actions can add up to make a big difference. Our Little Helps Plan identifies the most pressing social and environmental challenges facing the business, our customers and our communities, and outlines our commitments to help tackle these. People The 440,000 colleagues who work for us around the world are at the forefront of serving our shoppers better every day. We want to give them a great experience of working at Tesco and be a place where everyone can get on, whatever their ambitions. To do this, we are investing in training so colleagues are supported to develop their careers and to build skills for their future. We are committed to building an inclusive culture and ensuring these opportunities are available to all colleagues. We are also trialling a number of innovative solutions that will offer colleagues greater flexibility over their own work schedules. Our target To help our colleagues succeed by providing them with the flexibility, skills and reward they need to get on. For the full list of our targets and actions see our Little Helps Plan at www.

Building strong, trusted relationships with our suppliers plays a key role in achieving this. Health Our customers and colleagues tell us that they want to make healthier choices, but sometimes it can be difficult. We want to make it easier to lead a healthier life and we are focused on offering simple, practical actions that lead to sustainable changes. Packaging We know packaging plays an important role in preserving and protecting products but we are taking action to reduce its overall impact on the environment. We are working with the industry to develop a closed loop system which can be applied to all key packaging materials. Food waste We have a responsibility and commitment to lead reduction of food waste from farm to fork. Through our Group Chief Executive's Chairmanship of the international Champions 12.3 coalition, we are committed to accelerating progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal target to halve per capita global food waste by 2030. Our targets To help make sustainable products accessible and affordable for all. To support all of our colleagues to live healthier lives and help our customers make healthier food choices every time they shop with us. To ensure we never use more packaging than is needed, and that what we do use is from sustainable sources and goes on to be reused or recycled. To help halve global food waste, farm to fork, by 2030. Places We are proud to be a valued part of over 6,000 communities around the world and want to help them thrive. We bring social and economic benefits through the local people we employ, the local businesses we work with and the local projects we support. We support causes important to colleagues and customers. We deliver this through our community donation programmes, strategic partnerships with charities and support for food banks. Our target To help our local communities thrive by positively contributing both socially and economically. Foundations Underpinning all the pillars of the Little Helps Plan are a number of areas where it is vital to do the right thing. It remains a priority for us to ensure our products are safe, that we have a strong health and safety culture for customers and colleagues, and that we stay on track with our ambitious plan to become a zero-carbon business. We recognise that these areas and strong corporate governance are equally important to ensuring our business is having a positive impact on society. They are core expectations and are embedded in the way we do business. 17 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic report 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. indb 17 20 04 2018 15:43 shopping baskets outside of seasonal changes. For colleagues we have given out free fruit and offered mini health checks throughout our health events. In 2017 18 we also made mental wellbeing training available for all colleagues and brought together a group of colleague Health Heroes to share their stories and inspire others to make healthier choices. In January 2018, we announced a groundbreaking new five-year strategic partnership with the British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK and Diabetes UK. The aim of the partnership is to help reduce the risk of heart and circulatory disease, cancer and diabetes. The partnership will support colleagues, customers and their families to make sustainable lifestyle changes and adopt healthier habits. For more information visit www. Packaging We continue to make changes to our packaging to help reduce our impact on the environment. 87% of our Own Brand packaging by weight is currently widely recyclable. We have made significant changes to the packaging of our wet wipes, resulting in a 20% reduction in the material used and thereby removing 57 tonnes of plastic. This material saving is enough to make over 10 million more packs. We recognise that we can do more in partnership with government and industry to help establish a robust, closed loop approach to recover and reuse all key packaging materials. We have three strategic priorities to help reduce packaging waste and boost recycling across the UK: 1. Materials and design: In collaboration with our suppliers we are reducing packaging and restricting the number of materials we accept so that less packaging is used and packaging is easier to recycle. Recovery and recycling: We believe a holistic approach is required to create an integrated national recovery and recycling system. We support developing a cost-effective Deposit Return System DRS as one aspect of this approach. Changing customer behaviour: Once consistent recycling infrastructure is in place, we can help customers recycle more with simple, clear information. Tackling food waste Five years ago, we made a commitment to lead on reducing global food waste in our own operation, supply chains, and in our customers' homes. Food waste is a global challenge and through our international markets and Dave Lewis's Chairmanship of the international Champions 12.3 coalition, we are committed to driving progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal target to halve per capita global food waste by 2030. Products Sourcing with care In our UK supply chains, we are prioritising the environmental and social risks associated with 20 of our most important products and ingredients - from beef and coffee, to wild fish and cotton. To view the full top 20 list and some of the actions we are taking, visit www. Collaboration with suppliers, industry organisations, government bodies and civil society is vital for us to make progress. For example, we know that soil degradation is a key issue facing agricultural products and the environment. We analysed the most vulnerable regions we sourced from and in 2017 we started a new project in partnership with the Broads Authority and with the support of the Rivers Trust, National Farmers Union NFU and the Environment Agency. To raise awareness of the impact of water run-off with potato growers in East Anglia, we tested new technologies that help retain valuable top soil and reduce the amount of fertiliser entering local waterways. Working with partners, we will share the learnings in other key sourcing regions. This year, as part of our human rights due diligence approach, we have engaged stakeholders and other businesses to further understand the risks of forced labour in palm oil supply chains. 100% of the palm oil used in our Own Brand products in the UK is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil but we want to take further action to mitigate the social challenges associated with palm oil production. Our engagement has helped us identify and understand the areas of greatest risk, and we are working collaboratively through the Consumer Goods Forum to tackle this challenge as an industry. com sourcing for more information and www. com modernslavery for our latest Modern Slavery Statement. A healthier place to work and shop For many years we'five worked hard to help colleagues and customers make healthier food choices. We are also continuing to work with our suppliers to reduce the amount of sugar, fat and salt in thousands of products. In Central Europe in 2017 we reviewed 120 Own Brand soft drinks and introduced a new standard to limit the sugar to less than 1 teaspoon per 100ml. This follows the UK business which, by November 2016, had reduced the sugar in all Own Brand soft drinks to below the threshold for the government levy. We'five also helped increase consumption of fruit and vegetables by introducing new, great value ranges such as Farm Brands and Perfectly Imperfect. Our Free Fruit for Kids initiative remains popular in the UK and since 2016, we have given out 50 million pieces of free fruit in 800 stores. In May 2017 we held our first ever in-store health event in the UK. As part of this we reduced the price of 200 healthier products and highlighted in-store and online products which are lower in sugar, fat or salt. As a result, we saw the biggest monthly improvement in the health of our customers' In 2017 18, the 10 million tonnes of food sold in the UK retail operations generated 73,340 tonnes 0.7% of surplus. 53,126 tonnes 0.5% was wasted, which we sent for energy recovery. Of this, just 19,898 tonnes 0.2% was safe for human consumption. In September 2017 we also shared our 2016 17 food waste data for the Republic of Ireland and Central Europe for the first time. The page opposite gives a breakdown on our food surplus and waste in all these markets for 2017 18. In 2016, we made the commitment that no food that is safe for human consumption will go to waste from our UK retail operations by the end of 2017 18. We have worked hard to deliver our target through the launch of new industry leading initiatives. Surplus food safe for humans is offered to local charities through Community Food Connection. Food not taken by charities is offered to colleagues through our 'colleague shops' which have been rolled out to all stores. We send any suitable remaining surplus to animal feed. We have achieved huge progress in ensuring more good food goes to charity and we are now introducing a further programme of work to ensure no food safe for human consumption goes to waste. Our other markets share the same ambition and food redistribution programmes are now in all stores in the Republic of Ireland and all hypermarkets in Bangkok and Malaysia. In Central Europe over 600 stores out of a total 961 are already donating surplus food and all remaining stores will be donating by 2020. We are also working in partnership with our suppliers to offer customers the food they love with less waste. In 2017 18, we introduced resealable salad bags across our most popular salad lines and became the first UK supermarket to start selling perfectly ripe green satsumas and clementines that stay fresher for longer. In Central Europe, we introduced our Perfectly Imperfect range which has helped save over 6,000 tonnes of 'wonky' fruit and vegetables from going to waste. With 25 of our largest suppliers, we have announced a joint commitment to adopt UN Sustainable Development Goal target 12.3, measure and publish food waste data for their own operations and act to reduce food waste farm to fork. We are planning to build on this work over the coming year across more of our supply chains and communicate with customers on how they can reduce food waste in the home.

' Urszula Wisniewska Manager of Mozesz wiecej Poland beneficiary People Colleagues have told us how important flexibility and certainty are in order for them to reach their ambitions both inside and outside of work. In 2017 18 we started to trial a new app in the UK that allows colleagues to see their shifts, manage overtime and request holiday. In time the app will also give the option to swap shifts, request shift changes and even take shifts in different stores - providing them with genuine flexibility and control over their hours. We have committed to rolling out this app in all our markets and have already started to introduce a simplified version in our Asian stores. Our UK apprenticeship programme aims to give over 1,000 colleagues, of all ages and all levels of experience, the opportunity to continue their education and build skills for their future. With technology transforming society, we are also developing a training programme to ensure that all our colleagues have the digital competence and confidence to succeed. Inclusivity and creating a culture where everyone has equal opportunity remains integral to our business. In January 2018 we pledged support to the UN standards promoting the rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex LGBTI people. More recently we signed up to the 30% Club, demonstrating our commitment to having strong female representation within our senior leadership team by 2020. The ratio of male to female colleagues at 2017 18 year-end is outlined in the table below. Further analysis of our gender pay gap can also be found in the Corporate governance report on page 47 or online. Places In 2017 18 we have continued to support communities through our community donation initiatives. We have established programmes in the UK Bags of Help, Republic of Ireland Community Fund and Central Europe You Choose, We Help. All of these programmes put the power in the hands of our customers to choose the local projects that Tesco supports financially. In Central Europe one in every four customers voted in 'You Choose, We Help'. Through these programmes we have distributed over PS51m and supported more than 24,000 local projects to date. Wherever we operate we also work closely with food banks and local charities to help feed people in need in local communities. In 2017 18 we donated the equivalent of 46 million meals to help feed people in need across the UK, Republic of Ireland, and Central Europe through our food surplus redistribution programmes. In January 2018, all our stores in Malaysia also participated in a campaign which enabled customers to donate food to 100 local charities supporting vulnerable families and homeless people. In Thailand, customer fundraising meant that underprivileged children were able to have nutritious lunches throughout February 2018.

The location-method impact is provided for disclosure only and all intensity, net and gross emissions shown are calculated using the market-based method. Foundations Climate change In May 2017, we announced the new science-based targets on the right, which are aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement recommendation of a 1.5 degree global warming trajectory. They will also enable us to meet our ambition to become a zero-carbon business by 2050. Our carbon footprint is calculated according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and our net carbon footprint in 2017 18 was 3.4 million tonnes of CO 2 e. For our own operations absolute carbon emissions we achieved a 13% reduction compared to last year and 26% compared to 2015 16. To help us achieve our new targets, we have committed to source 100% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. In 2017 18, 55% of our electricity across the Group was from renewable sources and in the UK we have already switched to 100% renewable purchased electricity, supported by renewable energy certificates. This, in addition to investments in energy efficiency, has enabled us to reduce our net carbon intensity per sq. ft. of retail and distribution floor space by 6% compared with last year, and 15% since 2015 16. Our targets Reduce absolute carbon emissions from our operations from 2015 16 levels: 35% by 2020, 60% by 2025 and 100% by 2050. Source 65% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2020 and 100% by 2030. Anti-bribery and fraud We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethics and integrity in the way we do business around the world. We adopt a zero tolerance approach to bribery and fraud at Tesco and expect our business partners to do the same. Our Code of Business Conduct outlines our most important legal obligations and the policies that guide the conduct of all our colleagues in areas including health and safety, information security, bribery and fraud. In February 2018, we refreshed all our communications on the Code and held an internal campaign to encourage colleagues to speak up if they have any concerns the Code is not being followed. To support this culture, we also provide an independent and confidential whistleblowing service - Protector Line - that enables our colleagues, suppliers and their staff around the world to raise concerns. We use e-learning to support compliance with the Code and anti-bribery and anti-fraud training is included in our annual refresher training for all relevant colleagues. Everyone in the business must comply with the Code and we have implemented annual Code compliance declarations which are reviewed by our Group Risk and Compliance Committee. 21 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic report 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR.",

      "Detailed Analysis of ROE": "\u2022 Is **ROE** increasing (good sign) or declining (bad sign)? AI answer: The **ROE** has declined from **1.60%** (previous year) to **-0.62%** (current year), indicating a deterioration in the company's profitability relative to shareholders' equity.\n\n\u2022 Is growth in **ROE** higher than that of the competitors and the industry a firm operates in? AI answer: The report does not provide explicit competitor or industry **ROE** benchmarks; however, a negative **ROE** typically underperforms industry averages for a leading retailer, signaling underperformance relative to peers.\n\n\u2022 Is growth persistent (good sign) or temporary (bad sign)? AI answer: The decline appears to be influenced by exceptional charges, notably **PS263m** in exceptional costs, and ongoing restructuring efforts. Given the company\u2019s stated turnaround plans and improving operating profit margins, the decline may be partly temporary but with risks of persistence if exceptional and restructuring costs continue.\n\nForecasts:  \n\u2022 Expected **ROE** next year: Based on the company's guidance to recommence dividends in 2017-18 and ambitions to improve operating margin to **3.5%-4.0%** by 2019-20, **ROE** is expected to improve but likely remain modest in the short term as investments and cost reductions take effect.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The company\u2019s **ROE** has deteriorated from a positive **1.60%** to a negative **0.62%**, driven primarily by significant exceptional charges and restructuring costs reported in the year.  \n- Despite the decline, underlying operating profit before exceptional items increased by nearly 30%, suggesting operational improvements that may drive a recovery in **ROE** over time.  \n- The company\u2019s strategic focus on cost reductions (**PS1.5bn** target) and margin improvement signals potential for a return to positive and growing **ROE**, but near-term risk remains due to ongoing exceptional costs and pension deficits.",
      "Detailed Analysis of ROE Driver": "\u2022 Is growth in ROE driven by increases in both efficiency and margin (very good sign) or only by one measure (good sign)?  \nAI answer: The growth in ROE is not driven by both; **Asset Turnover** slightly decreased from **3.671** to **3.627**, indicating a minor decline in efficiency, while **Profit Margin** worsened significantly from a positive **0.2535%** to a negative **-0.0715%**, reflecting deteriorating profitability. This suggests weakening ROE primarily due to margin compression rather than efficiency gains.\n\n\u2022 Is the efficiency and margin higher compared to competitors and the industry (good sign)?  \nAI answer: The negative **Profit Margin** is a clear concern and likely below industry averages, signaling challenges in profitability. Although the **Asset Turnover** remains relatively high, the slight decline combined with margin erosion suggests the company is underperforming on profitability compared to peers, weakening investor value creation.\n\nForecasts:  \n\u2022 Expected Asset Turnover next year: AI answer  \nGiven the company's strategic focus on improving operational efficiency and store mix as described in the report, **Asset Turnover** is expected to stabilize or slightly improve, potentially reaching around **3.65**, assuming effective implementation of cost and property optimizations.\n\n\u2022 Expected Profit Margin next year: AI answer  \nWith ongoing turnaround efforts, cost reductions targeting **\u00a31.5bn**, and a goal to achieve a Group operating margin of **3.5% - 4.0%** by 2019-20, the **Profit Margin** is forecasted to improve significantly over the next year, likely moving back into positive territory and trending upwards toward the target margin range.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The company\u2019s **ROE** is currently weakening due predominantly to a declining **Profit Margin**, while **Asset Turnover** is slightly down but remains relatively strong.  \n- The negative margin indicates profitability challenges that overshadow operational efficiency, which is still competitive but not enough to offset margin pressure.  \n- Looking ahead, strategic initiatives and cost-saving programs suggest margin recovery will be the dominant driver for ROE improvement, with **Asset Turnover** expected to stabilize or modestly improve.",
      "Detailed Analysis of Risk": "\u2022 **Are risks increasing (bad sign) or declining (good sign)?** AI answer: Overall risk appears to be declining. NLP financial risk decreased from 1.2 to 1.05, and NLP legal risk notably dropped from 0.61 to 0.07, indicating reduced perceived financial and legal risks. However, NLP tax risk increased from 0.55 to 0.72, signaling rising tax-related concerns.\n\n\u2022 **Is the number and severity of risks higher than that of competitors/industry (bad sign)?** AI answer: Without direct competitor data, it is difficult to definitively conclude, but the substantial drop in legal risk and moderate decline in financial risk suggest the company is managing core risks effectively, potentially better than industry norms.\n\n\u2022 **Is sentiment increasing (good sign) or declining (bad sign)?** AI answer: Sentiment appears to be improving, as indicated by declining financial and legal risk scores. However, the increase in tax risk could temper overall positive sentiment.\n\n\u2022 **Is specificity increasing (good sign) or declining (bad sign)?** AI answer: Specificity increased from 0.08196 to 0.09698, indicating that disclosures have become more detailed and precise, which is a positive signal for transparency.\n\n\u2022 **Are complexity measures (sentence length, depth, and unfamiliarity) increasing (bad sign) or declining (good sign)?** AI answer: Complexity has slightly increased, with sentence length rising from 26.74 to 28.28 and sentence depth from 6.47 to 6.53. This suggests disclosures are somewhat more complex, which may challenge some investors but also reflect thoroughness.\n\n\u2022 **How are sentiment, specificity, and complexity compared to those of competitors?** AI answer: Without competitor benchmarks, exact comparisons are unavailable, but increased specificity alongside improved sentiment suggests better disclosure quality, though the slight rise in complexity may be a relative drawback.\n\nForecasts:\n\n\u2022 **Is Gearing expected to increase next year?** AI answer: Gearing increased from 3.53 to 4.48, indicating a rising leverage trend; unless addressed, gearing is expected to continue increasing, which may elevate financial risk.\n\n\u2022 **Is Current Ratio expected to increase next year?** AI answer: Current ratio improved modestly from 0.75 to 0.79, suggesting a slight strengthening of short-term liquidity, likely to continue improving if current trends hold.\n\n\u2022 **Is Quick Ratio expected to increase next year?** AI answer: Quick ratio rose from 0.34 to 0.37, indicating a marginally better position in liquid assets; this positive trend may persist, improving near-term financial flexibility.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The company\u2019s perceived financial and legal risks have decreased, signaling improved risk management; tax risk increased, warranting monitoring.  \n- Gearing has increased significantly, highlighting rising leverage and potential vulnerability.  \n- Liquidity ratios (current and quick) have improved slightly but remain below 1, indicating some short-term liquidity constraints.  \n- Disclosure specificity has improved, enhancing transparency and investor confidence.  \n- Complexity in disclosures has increased moderately, which may affect readability but reflects detailed reporting.  \n- Overall, risk disclosures show progress in transparency and risk reduction, but financial leverage growth is a concern.  \n- Investors should watch gearing trends and tax-related risks closely.  \n- The company appears to be on a path to improved risk transparency but must manage leverage prudently.  \n- Forward-looking liquidity positions show cautious optimism.  \n- Increased disclosure detail paired with improved sentiment is a positive signal for stakeholder trust.",
      "summary": "- The company\u2019s **ROE** declined from **1.60%** to **-0.62%**, mainly due to significant exceptional charges and restructuring costs, signaling near-term profitability challenges.  \n- Underlying operating profit before exceptional items increased nearly 30%, indicating operational improvements that support a potential recovery in **ROE**.  \n- **Profit Margin** deteriorated from **0.25%** to **-0.07%**, driving the negative **ROE**, while **Asset Turnover** remained relatively stable around **3.63**, showing consistent operational efficiency.  \n- Risk profile improved with financial risk down from **1.2** to **1.05** and legal risk sharply reduced from **0.61** to **0.07**, enhancing overall risk perception.  \n- However, **tax risk** increased from **0.55** to **0.72**, requiring investor vigilance on potential tax-related exposures.  \n- Leverage rose notably with **Gearing** increasing from **3.53** to **4.48**, heightening financial risk despite slight improvements in liquidity ratios (**Current Ratio** 0.79, **Quick Ratio** 0.37).  \n- Disclosure quality improved as specificity increased from **0.082** to **0.097**, promoting transparency, though complexity also rose modestly, which may affect readability.  \n- Forward-looking, **ROE** is expected to improve modestly as cost-saving initiatives and margin recovery efforts take effect, with **Asset Turnover** stabilizing near **3.65**.  \n- Liquidity trends suggest cautious optimism with slight increases in **Current** and **Quick Ratios**, but short-term constraints persist given ratios remain below 1.0.  \n- Investors should weigh the operational progress and improved risk transparency against elevated leverage and ongoing margin pressures when assessing the company\u2019s outlook."

Having focused on our three turnaround priorities, we are competitive in the UK again, our balance sheet is more secure, and we continue to rebuild trust by operating with transparency. At the same time, feedback from our customers, colleagues, supplier partners and shareholders continues to improve. We have stabilised our business, and now we are rebuilding profitability. But there is much more we want to do. We must keep listening and innovating: we want to offer truly helpful service: and we need to keep unlocking the power and potential of our colleagues. So we have shared our plans to do that. Our six strategic drivers are not new: they have been guiding our efforts throughout much of the last three years. But taken together, they set a clear direction. Our intention is to become even more competitive for customers, simpler for colleagues, and an even better partner for suppliers, while creating long-term value for our shareholders. At the centre of everything is our purpose: to serve shoppers a little better every day. If we keep putting the customer at the heart of our business, and ask ourselves how we can help serve them a little better every day, we can build on the momentum we are showing. There is still work to do, but this year's performance has demonstrated that every little help really can make a big difference at Tesco. Serving shoppers a little better every day. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 2 Introduction This year has been a significant one for Tesco, where, against a challenging external environment, we have continued to make progress against our purpose: to serve shoppers a little better every day. I am grateful to the management team and Tesco colleagues for all that they have done to deliver this. In October, we shared our plans to create long-term value for stakeholders, and in November, Dave Lewis and the management team invited investors, supplier partners and analysts to Tesco's offices in Welwyn Garden City to hear more about the six strategic drivers at the heart of those plans. This report sets out the progress we are making against each of those drivers and tells the story of how we are building on the strong foundations we laid down in the last few years. Although the business has continued to make significant progress this year, across many of our markets we continue to face a challenging operating environment. In the UK, business rates in particular continue to be a considerable burden, and are the biggest tax we have paid this year. John Allan Non-executive Chairman Building on strong foundations. \" I am very pleased to report another strong year of improvement at Tesco. \" We welcome the fact that the UK Government has committed to reviewing the tax framework and look forward to working with them on this. In terms of the Board's support for Tesco's agenda, we have focused on three areas: 1. corporate governance: 2. helping the business to benefit from the expertise of our Board: and 3. exploring opportunities for future growth. Throughout the year, we have continued to focus on strengthened corporate governance. In July, we appointed a new Non-executive Director, Steve Golsby, who brings a deep knowledge of Asia - in particular Thailand, our largest international market. In January, we were pleased that Deanna Oppenheimer accepted the Board's invitation to become Senior Independent Director. Deanna has a wealth of experience, and succeeds Richard Cousins, who decided to step down from the Board. I would like to thank Richard for his strong contributions to Board deliberations and wish him well for the future. Our emphasis on strong governance also extends to issues we have faced within our business. Last November, our Tesco Bank debit cards were the subject of an online fraudulent attack. We acted quickly to ensure customers' accounts were protected and there was no data loss or breach of systems. Shortly after the end of our 2016 17 financial year, we announced that our subsidiary business, Tesco Stores Limited, had reached an agreement on a Deferred Prosecution Agreement in relation to historic accounting practices, and that we had agreed with the UK Financial Conduct Authority to a finding of market abuse. This brings towards a close a challenging time in Tesco's history. The Board will continue to support Dave and the management team in their efforts to restore trust in the Tesco business and brand. Our second focus has been helping the business to benefit from the expertise of our Board. We have had in-depth reviews of our six strategic drivers and risk management, and we have supported the leadership team on talent development and corporate responsibility. Throughout the year, the Board has considered how Tesco can continue to create long-term value for our stakeholders. That included completing a portfolio review. As a result, we have sold Kipa, our retail business in Turkey: garden centre chain Dobbies: Euphorium bakery: Giraffe restaurants: and Harris Hoole coffee shops. All of these businesses have different strengths and potential, but the sales have allowed Tesco's management team to focus on the areas where Tesco can build on its core competencies and unique strengths to create future growth. This focus has allowed us to announce, in January, a proposed merger with Booker Group. This merger builds on Tesco's core strength as a food business and allows both Tesco and Booker to unlock growth in the UK food market in a way that neither would be able to do alone - in particular by focusing on the fast-growing 'out of home' and 'on the go' food markets, to create the UK's leading food business. Reflecting our improved performance and the Board's confidence in Tesco's future prospects, I am pleased to confirm that we intend to recommence paying dividends in respect of the 2017 18 financial year. We expect dividends to grow progressively from that financial year. We are conscious that the Tesco turnaround is a significant project, but I am confident that with the clear plans and superb talent we have in Dave and the whole Tesco team, there is a huge amount of potential to create sustainable, long-term value for all our stakeholders. John Allan Non-executive Chairman Watch our videos Visit www. com ar2017 to hear more from John Allan. 3 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Chairman's statement Whilst our business continues to face significant external challenges, such as the increasing burden of business rates, National Living Wage and the Apprenticeship Levy in the UK, and greater competitive intensity in Poland, we are making good progress. The energy and commitment of our 460,000 colleagues has enabled us to make further significant improvements to the way we serve our customers, and we have done this at the same time as increasing operating profit before exceptional items by 30% for the Group. In October 2014, we set out our three turnaround priorities and, in 2016, we shared the detail of the six strategic drivers which are driving our mediumand long-term decisions. This Annual Report gives a high-level overview of those six drivers. The strategic drivers are designed to create sustainable value for our four stakeholders in our business: customers, colleagues, supplier partners, and our shareholders. Customers At the heart of everything we do are our customers. In every decision we take, and every plan we develop, we ask ourselves one simple question: will it help serve shoppers a little better every day? In the year, we'five done a lot to strengthen our customer offer. We're continuing to see a sustained improvement in the feedback we're getting from customers on price, service, quality and availability. We continuously innovate to serve our customers better, and this year we have developed 2,422 new products with our supplier partners, as well as reformulating hundreds more products to make them healthier. We'five also made shopping easier for parents by offering free fruit for children in our large stores. Our prices are lower, with a typical basket of products in the UK costing 6% less than in September 2014. We'five also made our offer simpler, for example by cutting multi-buy promotions by a further 24%. At the same time, we have worked hard to remove reasons for customers to shop elsewhere by introducing seven exclusive fresh food brands, alongside our existing Brand Guarantee. Colleagues Every day, our colleagues go the extra mile to help our customers and it is really encouraging to see this coming through in customer feedback, with a continued increase in ratings of colleague helpfulness through the year. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive \" In every decision, we ask ourselves: how will this help serve shoppers a little better?\" Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 4 Group Chief Executive's statement A strong performance. This has been achieved while at the same time changing the way we serve our customers across our channels, as shopping habits change. Many colleagues have been impacted by the changes we have made to management structures and shift routines, including the move from night-time to day-time replenishment. This makes the feedback from customers even more humbling, and a credit to the unwavering commitment of our colleagues in serving shoppers a little better every day. Creating opportunities for colleagues to get on has been a big focus and will continue to be as our business evolves. This year 4,000 colleagues have been promoted or moved to broader roles across the business. We have welcomed over 100 graduates and supported 1,200 apprenticeships and work placements. Supplier partners Strong partnerships with our suppliers mean we can serve our customers better, invest in innovation and grow our businesses together for the long term. This year we have relaunched our online Supplier Network, which now has over 5,000 members. Reflecting the strength of our partnerships, for the first time we topped the independent supplier survey run by Advantage in October, and our own internal Supplier Viewpoint survey shows that 77% of suppliers are positive about their relationship with us. We were also pleased to be recognised by supply chain body GS1 UK, for leading the industry in supporting small British suppliers. Shareholders In order to share more fully our investment case, we have set out more detail on our medium-term ambitions. In particular, we shared our ambition to deliver a Group operating margin of between 3.5% - 4.0% by our 2019 20 financial year, and we have made good progress towards that ambition this year, with a step up from 1.8% to 2.3% in Group operating margin before exceptionals. We have also announced our intention to recommence paying dividends in respect of the 2017 18 financial year, to return value to shareholders in a way which is sustainable for our business. Governance Following the year-end, we announced a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the UK Serious Fraud Office in relation to historic accounting practices, and an agreement with the UK Financial Conduct Authority to a finding of market abuse. Over the last two and a half years, we have fully cooperated with this investigation, while at the same time taking steps to transform our business. What happened in 2014 is a huge source of regret for all of us, and we are determined to maintain and strengthen the changes we have been making to rebuild trust in our business and brand. As well as bringing this matter towards a conclusion, we have made good progress on wider issues of corporate responsibility. We have made a commitment that by the end of 2017, no food that is safe for human consumption will go to waste from our UK retail operations - and this year we have seen a 148% increase in the amount of surplus food donated to people in need. Future growth In January, we announced a proposed merger with Booker Group, to create the UK's leading food business. Bringing together the complementary skills of retail and wholesale businesses will allow us to unlock new opportunities and to better serve customers with a wide range of high-quality affordable food where they want it, when they want it. I'd like to thank all of my colleagues for everything they have done for our customers and our business this year. We have been through some tough years in rebuilding our business, and I'm continually grateful for everything they do. Our goal now is to go even further together. Over the last year we have turned a corner but, as always, we have more to do. We will keep putting the customer at the heart of the business, and we will continue to work openly and transparently with our supplier partners, our colleagues and every shareholder in our business. We will continue to strive to serve our shoppers a little better every day. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive 5 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Our six strategic drivers set out the plans and aspirations which will create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Maximise the mix to achieve a 3.5% - 4.0% Group margin Building sustainable profitability across our businesses, channels and product ranges. A differentiated brand A strong brand creates long-term value. Our purpose, to serve shoppers a little better every day, is at the heart of what our brand stands for. Maximise value from property Our property strategy is about releasing value from our estate, and repurposing space to enhance our customer offer. Reduce operating costs by PS1.5bn We have undertaken a thorough review of our entire cost base, to identify further opportunities for meaningful savings. Innovation Our innovation strategy is driven by expertise and insight in our three differentiating capabilities: Product, Channel and Customer. Generate PS9bn cash from operations Cash is the lifeblood of our business, and we have set a three-year target to generate PS9bn of cumulative retail cash from operations. 7 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Reduce operating costs by PS1.5bn We'five identified PS1.5bn of potential savings for the years to 2019 20, with particular opportunities to simplify the way we run our stores, modernise our distribution and fulfilment networks, and more efficiently procure goods and services not for resale. This year we have generated PS455m of cost savings, of which PS226m contributes to our PS1.5bn target. Goods not for resale - c. PS500m In our day-to-day operations we purchase a wide range of goods and services not for resale, covering everything from marketing to haulage and consumables. Consolidating our spend with our most important supplier partners has allowed us to make substantial savings - for example by reducing our number of haulage partners in Central Europe from 10 down to three, working across the region. Logistics and distribution - c. PS450m Improving stock flow and increasing the efficiency of our supply chains reduces our costs, and also helps us get products to customers faster - so they benefit from fresher food too. As part of this work, we're changing our distribution network - announcing the closure of our distribution centres in Welham Green and Chesterfield - to ensure that the way we distribute food and goods within our business is as simple and cost-effective as possible. Store operating model - c. PS550m Continuing to improve service in store is our absolute priority, and by recalibrating the way we serve customers we have identified opportunities to increase customer satisfaction while also reducing costs. In our UK stores, we have worked with colleagues to ensure that we schedule hours for when our customers need them most, reducing our night operations and moving replenishment to the daytime. A differentiated brand We are on a journey to rebuild trust in our brand, and we have made significant progress. As the brand strengthens, we invest more in those things that make the Tesco brand and experience unique. Our opportunity is to differentiate through our products and services - with great quality at affordable prices, and a unique Tesco offer - and through customer experience, for example by simplifying our systems for ordering online, and delivering consistently great service in store. With our Brand Guarantee, customers don't have to worry about the price of branded products - which they could get from other retailers - and our own-label products become the point of differentiation, with a unique and helpful offer which gives customers a reason to choose Tesco. We take pride in the quality of our food, and that's reflected in our 'Food Love Stories brought to you by Tesco' campaign, which aims to set out our food quality credentials and celebrate the passion and care that goes into the meals we all love. The six strategic drivers continued Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 8 Our world-class store ordering systems have allowed us to simplify backroom procedures in stores - increasing the amount of stock that goes straight from a delivery onto shelves. This ensures great availability for customers, while also reducing the residual stockholding in store and allowing our colleagues to more efficiently manage stock by only handling a product once. Our 88,000 square feet store in Surat Thani was too large, with an overly-broad range that made the shopping trip harder for customers. We took out around 20% of the retail space, creating room for tenants such as Boots and KFC. These bring new income and attract more customers, with a halo effect on our core retail offer and a resulting increase in retail sales density. Maximise the mix to achieve a 3.5% - 4.0% Group margin By improving profitability and optimising working capital, we will generate positive cash from our retail operations. Cash from operations is the biggest contributor to free cash flow, but working capital is a significant opportunity - with better forecasting, and a tighter assortment of products in our distribution centres, we can reduce stock holding and drive working capital benefits. We are also focused on capital discipline to improve free cash flow and have set rigorous hurdle rates for capital allocation, with a focus on payback periods and maximising returns, in order to balance longer-term investments with projects that will more quickly deliver cash. Maximising the mix means looking at the full picture of everything we do to ensure we are delivering great service for our customers, and driving growth in areas which deliver sustainable profits - in order to achieve a 3.5% - 4.0% Group operating margin by our 2019 20 financial year. We serve shoppers through a wide range of channels and services. To ensure we can deliver these sustainably, we work hard to build long-term profitability - by investing in new areas, and by improving the economics of more recent channels, such as Grocery Home Shopping. We follow this approach in all parts of our business, from choosing how we allocate space in our large stores, to looking at the promotional mix we offer to our online customers. 9 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report We have innovated in our ranges, bringing customers great quality meat and produce at affordable prices through our exclusive fresh food brands. Our innovative Free From range also includes many of the products our customers miss most - like our award-winning Free From Garlic Baguette. In March 2017, we were named Free From Retailer of the Year for the third year running. Maximise value from property We have a significant property portfolio, combining both freehold and leasehold assets. We look closely at opportunities to insulate the business from future rental increases, by carefully optimising our freehold and leasehold mix. Repurposing space - in our stores, malls or car parks - allows us to improve sales densities in our larger stores, while also improving our offer for customers. In the UK we have worked with other leading brands to open 49 concessions in our stores this year, with partners including Arcadia Group and Holland & Barrett. We are also exploring opportunities to release value by selling 'air rights' above a small number of our stores in urban areas - working with a developer to build residential properties above or alongside our stores, without capital investment from Tesco. Innovation By listening to shoppers, and looking at broader customer trends, we can drive innovation in both the products we sell, and the channels through which we sell them. Innovation touches everything we do, from the launch of our PayQwiq digital wallet, making the checkout process easier for customers, to our work on reformulation - taking hundreds of tonnes of salt, sugar and fat out of our own-label products to help customers live healthier lives. The strength of the partnerships we have with our suppliers plays an important role in innovation. By building our businesses together, we also give suppliers the confidence to invest in innovative products and solutions for the benefit of our mutual customers. The six strategic drivers continued Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 10 Our business is organised around the three pillars of Customers, Product and Channels. We place customers at the centre of everything we do to deliver our purpose - serving shoppers a little better every day. Reinvest Our focus is always on making Tesco the best it can be for our customers. The better a job we do for customers, the more we will improve sales: the more our sales improve, the more we can reinvest in further improving the shopping trip.

A detailed analysis of discontinued operations can be found in Note 7. This was a strong performance for Tesco where we delivered results ahead of expectations. We grew sales, excluding VAT, excluding fuel, by 1.1% at constant rates and we saw positive volume growth in both the UK & ROI and International segments. Group operating profit before exceptional items was PS1,280m, up 29.9% on last year as we continue to rebuild profitability whilst investing in the customer offer. Our statutory profit before tax was down 28.2 % to PS145m including PS 263 m of exceptional costs. We generated retail operating cash flow of PS2.3bn, up 9.1% on last year, including a PS387m improvement pre-exceptionals in working capital, and we also reduced net debt excluding Tesco Bank by 27% to PS 3.7 bn. Now that our business has stabilised we have also shared more detail about our clear plans for the coming years. We are well-placed to deliver our ambition of a Group operating margin of 3.5% - 4.0% by the 2019 20 financial year. This ambition is underpinned by six strategic drivers, including the PS1.5bn operating cost reductions which we are on track to secure over the next three years. Reflecting our improved performance and confidence in future prospects, the Board has reviewed our dividend policy. We intend to recommence paying dividends in respect of the financial year 2017 18. We expect dividends to grow progressively from that financial year with the aim of achieving a target cover of around two times earnings per share over the medium term. \" This was a strong performance for Tesco where we delivered results ahead of expectations. \" com ar2017 to find PDF and Excel downloads of our financial statements. Alan Stewart Chief Financial Officer Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 14 Profit recovery continues. In the UK and the Republic of Ireland ROI, we have now seen five consecutive quarters of like-for-like sales growth. In the UK, volumes grew 1.6% and transactions grew 1.7% as we continued to make fundamental improvements to all aspects of our offer. We saw annual positive like-for-like growth for the first time in seven years and outperformed the market across all categories on a volume basis. Volume outperformance was particularly strong in fresh food, where the exclusive brands we launched in March 2016 have helped to significantly strengthen our value proposition. Significant product cost deflation in the first half of the year eased in the second half. In collaboration with our supplier partners, we have worked hard to minimise the impact of emerging inflationary cost pressures. Despite some inflation in a number of categories, the price of a typical customer basket remains around 6% cheaper than in September 2014 and promotional participation has fallen to 32% as we made a conscious decision to focus our investments on sustainable improvements rather than on short-term couponing and promotions. We achieved improvements in all key customer metrics, including colleague helpfulness and availability, where performance reached record levels. In the Republic of Ireland, like-for-like sales fell by 0.1 % as we continued to invest in lowering prices. We have a leading position in the market in volume terms and have further grown volume share by making improvements across our customer offer, with a focus on fresh produce, meat and bakery. Our full-year UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items was PS803m, up 60% on last year, with margin growth of 68 basis points year-on-year. This improvement includes the impact of investments we have made in all aspects of our offer, particularly in lowering core prices and in the quality and price of the exclusive fresh food brands which we launched in March 2016. These investments enabled us to drive volume growth, generating positive operational leverage. In addition to managing costs more effectively year-on-year, we are also optimising the mix of our offer across channels and products. For example, within our beers, wines and spirits category we have focused on improving the relevance and profitability of our offer by broadening our range of speciality beers, increasing the prominence of own brand products and maintaining a strong, stable core price position in an extremely promotional market.

International sales growth weakened in the second half due to an increasingly competitive environment in Europe, particularly Poland, and as we annualised a strong performance last year in Asia. In the year, we grew like-for-like sales strongly in Thailand as we invested in both lowering prices and improving our fresh food proposition. We grew market share and were pleased to retain our number one position for customers for brand and trust a. In Malaysia, top-line sales growth was held back by weak consumer spending across the market and a trend away from large stores towards convenience shopping, where we are currently under-represented. In Central Europe, like-for-like sales grew in all markets apart from Poland which remains intensely competitive. Positive volume growth in the region was driven by a strong performance in fresh food where we improved quality and inspired customers with new ranges and events.

Whilst we continued to invest in our offer in all of our markets, our response to intense competition in Poland weighed on profitability in Central Europe. We continued to focus on improving our store economics across the region, including simplifying management structures, reducing store administration and closing unprofitable store counters. We also opened a new distribution centre at Poznan in Poland, reducing transport costs for the country by 20%. From April 2017, we have separated the management of our international business, creating two new Executive Committee roles leading Asia and Central Europe, giving greater focus to each region. The introduction of a new retail tax in Poland remains suspended pending the outcome of the European Commission's investigation. We continue to be cautious about potential legislative changes in our European markets. Tesco Bank 2016 17 2015 16 Year-on-year change Revenue PS1,012m PS955m 6.0% Operating profit before exceptional items PS157m PS162m 3.1 % Operating profit PS77m PS161m 52.2 % Lending to customers PS9,961m PS8,542m 16.6% Customer deposits PS8,463m PS7,397m 14.4% Net interest margin 4.0% 4.2% 0.2 % Risk asset ratio 20.0% 20.0% - Tesco Bank continues to provide a simple and transparent product offer to serve the banking and insurance needs of Tesco customers. Active customer account numbers grew by 3.5%, with particularly strong growth in current accounts. We have continued to improve our customer offer by introducing a new premium credit card, simplifying the loan application process by introducing digital signatures, giving interest rate guarantees on current accounts for new and existing customers and through a national roll-out of PayQwiq to all large stores, a digital wallet app that allows customers to pay with their phone in our shops. Operating profit before exceptional items reduced by 3.1 % to PS157m. This decline was due to the full year effect of the introduction of European Commission caps on interchange income which first came into effect in December 2015. Adjusting for this impact, we saw strong profit growth driven primarily by lending income. Exceptional items of PS 80 m relating to Tesco Bank include an increase in the provision for customer redress and a restructuring charge. Risk-weighted assets have risen in line with lending and the Core Tier 1 ratio has improved to 16.7%. The balance sheet remains strong and well-positioned to support future lending growth from both a liquidity and capital perspective. Exceptional items in operating profit 2016 17 2015 16 Net impairment of non-current assets and onerous lease provisions PS 6 m PS 423 m Net restructuring and redundancy costs PS 199 m PS 126 m Provision for customer redress PS 45 m - Interchange settlement PS57m - Property transactions PS165m PS156m Provision for SFO and FCA obligations PS 235 m - Past service credit and associated costs arising on UK defined benefit pension scheme closure - PS480m Total exceptional items in operating profit PS 263 m PS87m Exceptional items are excluded from our headline performance measures by virtue of their size and nature, in order to reflect management's view of the performance of the Group. In the current year, the net effect of exceptional items on operating profit is PS 263 m. Our annual impairment testing resulted in a net charge of PS 6 m. This comprises a net PS103m provision release relating to property, a net increase of PS 56 m in onerous lease provisions and a net PS 53 m impairment charge in goodwill and intangible assets, principally relating to dunnhumby subsidiary, Sociomantic. Net restructuring and redundancy charges of PS 199 m relate principally to changes to our distribution network and store colleague structures and working practices in the UK & ROI, and also includes a PS 35 m charge relating to Tesco Bank business simplification. The provision for customer redress of PS 45 m was recognised in Tesco Bank in the first half, following updated guidance published by the Financial Conduct Authority, proposing an extension to the Payment Protection Insurance settlement deadline which is now set at August 2019. Exceptional items include a credit of PS57m in relation to a legal settlement in respect of interchange fees. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 16 Financial review continued We generated net profits pre-tax of PS165m from property transactions in the year, of which PS91m related to the sale of the Letnany Shopping Mall and Liberec Forum Shopping Centre in the Czech Republic. We also sold a number of properties and development sites in the UK & ROI business. An exceptional charge of PS 235 m has been recorded as an adjusting post balance sheet event, following judicial approval on 10 April 2017 of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement between Tesco Stores Limited and the UK Serious Fraud Office regarding historic accounting practices and an agreement with the UK Financial Conduct Authority of a finding of market abuse in relation to the Tesco PLC trading statement announced on 29 August 2014. Joint ventures and associates, interest and tax Joint ventures and associates Losses from joint ventures and associates before exceptional items increased by PS 9 m to PS 30 m, due to lower profits recognised in our UK property joint ventures. After exceptional items, including an impairment of investment property within Gain Land, our associate in China, and an adjustment in insurance reserves in Tesco Underwriting, our share of post-tax losses from joint ventures and associates rose to PS 107 m from PS 21 m last year. Finance income and costs 2016 17 2015 16 Interest receivable and similar income PS48m PS29m IAS 32 and 39 'Financial instruments' - fair value remeasurements PS61m - Finance income PS109m PS29m Interest payable PS 523 m PS 490 m Capitalised interest PS6m PS6m IAS 32 and 39 'Financial instruments' - fair value remeasurements - PS 19 m IAS 19 net pension finance costs PS 113 m PS 155 m Finance costs PS 630 m PS 658 m Exceptional charge: Translation of Korea proceeds PS 244 m PS 220 m Statutory finance costs PS 874 m PS 878 m Finance income rose to PS109m, mainly due to the favourable effect of marking-to-market financial instruments. These are non-cash adjustments driven by changes in the market's assessment of credit and debt risk. Interest payable increased to PS 523 m due to debt acquired as part of our February 2016 agreement to regain sole ownership of 49 stores and two distribution centres. The impact of this was partially offset by a PS26m reduction in interest following the repayment of debt in the year. Net pension finance costs of PS 113 m reduced in line with the reduction in the opening IAS 19 pension deficit at the start of the 2016 17 financial year. Net pension finance costs are calculated by multiplying the opening net deficit by the opening discount rate each year. For 2017 18, they are expected to increase to c. PS 165 m. An exceptional non-cash loss of PS 244 m arose on the translation of the proceeds from the sale of our Homeplus business in Korea which were held in GBP money market funds in a non-Sterling denominated subsidiary. This does not represent any economic cost to the Group. Group tax Tax on profit before exceptional items was PS 185 m with an effective rate of tax for the Group of 25%. This tax rate is higher than the UK statutory rate primarily due to the impact of the 8% supplementary tax surcharge on bank profits, introduced in January 2016, and depreciation of assets that does not qualify for tax relief. The tax rate benefited from the impact on deferred tax of the expected reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% in 2020. On a statutory basis, including an exceptional credit of PS98m principally relating to a lower book value than tax value of property disposals and tax relief on exceptional impairment and restructuring costs, the tax charge was PS 87 m. The effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items for the 2017 18 financial year is expected to be similar to this year, at around 25%. Earnings per share on a continuing operations basis Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items and net pension finance costs were 7.90p, 41% higher year-on-year principally due to our stronger profit performance. Statutory basic earnings per share from continuing operations were 0.81p, lower than last year driven by higher net exceptional costs. 17 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Summary of total indebtedness 2016 17 2015 16 Movement Net debt excludes Tesco Bank PS 3,729 m PS 5,110 m PS1,381m Discounted operating lease commitments PS 7,440 m PS 7,814 m PS374m Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax PS 5,504 m PS 2,612 m PS 2,892 m Total indebtedness PS 16,673 m PS 15,536 m PS 1,137 m Net debt excluding Tesco Bank reduced by PS1.4bn to PS 3.7 bn, as our retail operating cash flow and property and business disposal proceeds were greater than capital expenditure and other charges. We have a strong funding and liquidity profile underpinned by PS4.4bn committed facilities and our key credit metrics fixed charge cover, net debt EBITDA and total indebtedness ratio have improved over the year. Discounted operating lease commitments The reduction in discounted operating lease commitments includes a benefit from the buybacks we have completed in the UK. In the year, we regained sole ownership of 16 superstores from a number of different vendors, resulting in an annual rent saving of PS22m. Pension The IAS 19 pension deficit measure, which relates to our closed UK defined benefit scheme, increased by PS 2.9 bn to PS 5.5 bn due to the reduction in bond yields. Despite this increase in the IAS 19 measure of our liabilities, the actual pension payments that are payable to members in the future have not changed. During the year, we completed a fide-risking programme which has reduced the future volatility of the scheme's long-term funding. At the last triennial valuation, the Trustee and the Company agreed a long-term funding plan where the Company is paying contributions of PS270m a year to the UK defined benefit scheme. The next triennial actuarial valuation is effective as at 31 March 2017 and work is already underway. The Trustee is aiming to conclude the valuation as soon as is reasonably possible. Summary retail cash flow 2016 17 2015 16 Cash flow from continuing operations excluding working capital PS1,695m PS2,033m Increase decrease in working capital underlying decrease in working capital PS387m PS377m impact from exceptional items PS197m PS 91 m cash impact of new approach to supplier payments - PS 231 m Cash generated from operations - continuing operations PS2,279m PS2,088m Cash generated from operations - discontinued operations PS 1 m PS493m Cash generated from operations PS2,278m PS2,581m Interest paid PS 518 m PS 422 m Corporation tax paid received PS 64 m PS125m Net cash generated from retail operating activities PS1,696m PS2,284m Cash capital expenditure PS 1,328 m PS 1,004 m Free cash flow PS368m PS1,280m Other investing activities PS1,620m PS543m Net cash used in from financing activities and intra-Group funding and intercompany transactions PS 1,342 m PS 854 m Net increase in cash and cash equivalents PS646m PS969m Include exclude cash movements in debt items PS1,114m PS4,219m Fair value and other non-cash movements PS 379 m PS 1,817 m Movement in net debt PS1,381m PS3,371m On an underlying basis, working capital improved by PS387m driven by growing sales volumes, initiatives to reduce stockholding and the timing effect of a fuel payment. The reported total reduction in working capital also includes the net impact of exceptional items. Excluding working capital, we generated PS1.7bn of cash from continuing retail operations. The decrease of PS 0.3 bn on the previous year primarily reflects the payment of a turnaround bonus to colleagues in cash rather than shares and higher net exceptional costs than last year. Interest paid was PS 96 m higher than last year due to the debt acquired as part of our February 2016 agreement to regain sole ownership of 49 stores and two distribution centres. The impact of this was partially offset by PS1.2bn of debt we redeemed in September 2016 and a further PS0.7bn of debt we redeemed in January 2017. The cash tax outflow of PS 64 m reflects payments by our international businesses which more than offset a refund of taxes already paid in the UK, as we continue to agree and close historic enquiries into tax returns. Cash movements of PS1.1bn in debt items primarily reflect the redemption of three medium-term notes on their maturity. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 18 Financial review continued Capital expenditure 2016 17 2015 16 UK & ROI PS731m PS676m International PS403m PS254m Tesco Bank PS46m PS40m Group PS1,180m PS970m Capital expenditure excluding buybacks of PS1.2bn was PS0.2bn higher than last year reflecting our planned increase in spend to refresh more than 200 stores in the UK and to accelerate the store opening programme in Thailand. We now expect Group capital expenditure to be around PS1.25bn in 2017 18. This is around PS250m below our original estimate, as we continue to focus on capital spend that delivers attractive returns and move more of our planned technology spend to cloud-based services. There was a net reduction of 2.2 m square feet, which includes 1.7 m square feet related to the disposal of Dobbies garden centres with the balance being net closures of space. In Asia we opened 114 stores, primarily in our convenience format in Thailand. In Europe we closed 23 stores. This year we repurposed just over 1.0m square feet across the Group, improving the ease and relevance of the shopping trip for customers. This included 0.5m square feet in Thailand repurposed for new and existing partners, including five new branches of Decathlon Sports, exclusive in the market to Tesco Lotus, and four new cinemas. In the UK, we repurposed 0.1m square feet in 14 stores, introducing brands such as Miss Selfridge, Wallis and Holland & Barrett. Property 2016 17 2015 16 UK & ROI International Group UK & ROI International Group Property a - fully owned Estimated market value PS13.1bn PS6.7bn PS19.9bn PS13.3bn PS6.4bn PS19.7bn Net book value b PS12.6bn PS5.1bn PS17.8bn PS12.6bn PS5.0bn PS17.6bn % net selling space owned 52% 74% 63% 52% 71% 61% % total property owned - by value c 50% 78% 57% 47% 75% 54% a Stores, malls, investment property, offices, distribution centres, fixtures and fittings and work-in-progress. b Property, plant and equipment excluding vehicles. The estimated market value of our fully owned property has increased by PS0.2bn to PS19.9bn, retaining a surplus of PS2.1bn over the net book value, as the repurchase of 16 stores in the UK and a foreign exchange translation effect more than offset the impact of the sale of Turkey and Dobbies garden centres. Our Group freehold property ownership percentage, by value, has increased from 54% to 57% year-on-year, driven by both the UK & ROI and International. In International, the effect of the sale of our business in Turkey more than offset the impact of the sale of two large freehold shopping centres in the Czech Republic on the mix of freehold to leasehold. In April 2017, we regained ownership of a further seven large stores in the UK with a freehold valuation of PS219m in a transaction with British Land. Including the effect of this transaction, we have now increased our proportion of freehold ownership by value in the UK & ROI to 51%, up by 10% over two years. The repurchase of stores to date has resulted in an annualised saving of PS152m rent, predominantly in relation to fixed-uplift and index-linked rental agreements. The Group operating lease charge reduced by 9% in the year to PS1.0bn. We continue to seek opportunities to further reduce our exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift rent inflation where the economics are attractive. Looking ahead We made good progress over the last year, further strengthening our customer offer and delivering an improvement in profitability a little ahead of expectations. We are confident in the plans we have shared and in the progress we will make this year, including further steps towards reducing our costs by PS1.5bn, generating PS9bn retail cash from operations and improving Group operating margin to between 3.5% and 4.0% by 2019 20. With a much more competitive offer and supplier partnerships as strong as they have ever been, we are much better positioned to navigate challenging market conditions. In January, we announced that we had agreed the terms of a proposed merger with Booker, focused on unlocking new growth, particularly in the faster-growing 'out of home' food market. We are continuing to engage as planned with the Competition and Markets Authority in advance of seeking shareholder approval for the transaction, anticipated in late 2017 early 2018.

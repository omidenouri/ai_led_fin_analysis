      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE": "- The **Return on Equity (ROE)** increased significantly from approximately **0.75%** in the previous year to **6.62%** in the current year, indicating a marked improvement in the company's ability to generate profit from shareholders' equity.  \n- This improvement reflects enhanced **profitability** and more effective **capital utilization** despite the challenging retail market environment.  \n- The **underlying profit before tax** fell by 6.9%, yet the ROE rose, suggesting that the company managed to optimize its **equity base** or reduce equity levels, improving efficiency.  \n- The company\u2019s **reduction in capital expenditure** to no more than \u00a32.5 billion over the next three years points to disciplined capital management, which supports sustainable ROE growth.  \n- Tesco's focus on **multichannel leadership** and **customer-centric strategies** is enhancing revenues and customer loyalty, key drivers for future profitability.  \n- The strategic exit from underperforming international markets, notably the US and China (now accounted as discontinued operations), helps improve the quality of earnings and return metrics.  \n- The company maintained a **stable dividend**, reflecting confidence in cash flow and earnings stability, which appeals to shareholders.  \n- Risks such as economic uncertainty, competitive pressures, and regulatory challenges remain, but management\u2019s focus on **cost control** and **operational efficiency** mitigates these.  \n- While short-term pressures might constrain immediate profit growth, the company's **long-term strategy** and ongoing store refreshment programs are expected to sustain ROE improvement.  \n- Over the next quarter and year, ROE is likely to remain on an upward trajectory if the company continues executing its strategy effectively and managing capital prudently, implying **positive shareholder returns** ahead.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE Driver": "- **Asset Turnover** declined from approximately **4.95** to **4.08**, indicating a reduction in the company\u2019s efficiency in using its assets to generate sales. This weakening suggests the firm is generating less revenue per unit of asset compared to the previous year.\n- Conversely, **Profit Margin** improved markedly from **0.19%** to **1.53%**, a significant increase highlighting enhanced profitability on each unit of sales.\n- The drop in asset turnover could reflect challenges in the retail sector such as **weaker UK trading conditions**, **regulatory impacts in South Korea**, and **political unrest in Thailand**, as noted in the report.\n- The improved profit margin seems to be driven by focused actions like **accelerated investment in price and quality**, **better cost controls**, and a strategic shift towards **higher-margin multichannel offerings**.\n- From an investor value creation standpoint, the **strengthening profit margin** is a positive sign, indicating better operational leverage and pricing power.\n- However, the **declining asset turnover** signals potential issues in asset utilization and store productivity, which could pressure returns if not addressed.\n- The annual report\u2019s emphasis on **accelerating store refresh programs, enhancing convenience formats, and expanding online channels** suggests management is aware and actively working to improve asset efficiency.\n- The balance between these drivers indicates profitability is currently the **more dominant contributor** to ROE changes, overshadowing the weakening asset turnover.\n- Over the next quarter and year, the company expects **asset efficiency to improve** as store refurbishments and format innovations take effect.\n- Profitability is also expected to be **maintained or grow gradually**, supported by ongoing investments in pricing, product range, and Clubcard-driven loyalty programs.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of Risk": "- The company\u2019s **gearing ratio** increased from 1.75 to 2.09, indicating higher financial leverage and increased reliance on debt financing, which raises financial risk.\n- Both the **current ratio** (0.69 to 0.73) and **quick ratio** (0.16 to 0.17) improved slightly, though remaining below 1, suggesting continued liquidity constraints but a marginally better short-term financial position.\n- The **NLP financial risk** score rose from 0.67 to 0.79, signaling heightened perceived financial risk in the report\u2019s narrative.\n- **NLP legal risk** surged significantly from 0.20 to 0.76, highlighting that legal concerns, possibly compliance or regulatory issues, have emerged as a major risk factor.\n- Conversely, **NLP tax risk** decreased from 0.69 to 0.60, indicating somewhat reduced emphasis or exposure to tax-related risks.\n- The **NLP specificity** slightly declined (0.074 to 0.071), suggesting a minor reduction in the precision and concreteness of risk disclosures.\n- **Sentence length** increased from 27.1 to 31.1 words and **sentence depth** marginally decreased (6.58 to 6.43), reflecting longer but slightly less syntactically complex sentences.\n- Longer sentences combined with slightly lower depth may indicate more elaborate explanations but with somewhat simpler sentence structures, which may aid or hinder clarity depending on content.\n- Overall, the report reveals an **increase in perceived risk**, especially financial and legal, with small improvements in liquidity but potential concerns over growing debt levels.\n- The slight reduction in specificity and increased sentence length point to a modest decline in **disclosure clarity**, suggesting a need for clearer, more focused risk communication to enhance investor confidence.",
      "summary": "- **Return on Equity (ROE)** improved substantially from **0.75%** to **6.62%**, reflecting enhanced **profitability** and more efficient **capital utilization** despite a 6.9% decline in underlying profit before tax.  \n- The company optimized its **equity base** and implemented disciplined **capital expenditure** controls, maintaining spend under \u00a32.5 billion over three years, supporting sustainable ROE growth.  \n- A strategic focus on **multichannel leadership**, **customer-centric initiatives**, and exiting underperforming international markets has strengthened revenue quality and future earnings potential.  \n- **Asset turnover** declined from 4.95 to 4.08, signaling reduced efficiency in using assets to generate sales, partly due to external market challenges and regional regulatory impacts.  \n- Conversely, a marked improvement in **profit margin** from 0.19% to 1.53% highlights better **operational leverage**, **cost control**, and a shift toward higher-margin offerings.  \n- Management\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve **asset efficiency** through store refresh programs and expansion of convenience and online formats are expected to reverse the asset turnover decline.  \n- Financial risk increased, evidenced by a rise in the **gearing ratio** from 1.75 to 2.09, indicating greater reliance on debt and higher leverage risk.  \n- Liquidity ratios improved slightly but remain below 1, signaling persistent short-term liquidity constraints.  \n- Significant increases in **legal risk** and overall **financial risk** perception call for enhanced risk management and clearer risk disclosures to maintain investor confidence.  \n- While short-term pressures exist, the company\u2019s strategic initiatives and disciplined capital management underpin a positive outlook for sustained ROE improvement and shareholder returns."

      "full_report_sentence": "The future: strategic developments in retail The backdrop of technology-driven change in the retail sector becomes a more insistent drumbeat every day. Boundaries between the online and offline world are becoming blurred. The challenge, and opportunity, for retailers is not just to have and be able to operate across multiple channels. It is to meet the rapid changes in consumer behaviour that we are seeing as technology opens up new horizons for them. The capacity for consumers to communicate instantly with each other, with us and with other retailers is driving completely different expectations for service levels, choice, convenience, indeed the whole shopping experience. A level of customisation and personalisation, unthinkable a decade ago is becoming the norm. Consequently, being a leading retailer today is not a guarantee of value creation tomorrow. We need to ensure that we are tomorrow's leading retailer. We had already set ourselves on the path to becoming a leading multichannel retailer to meet this challenge. The accelerating evolution of customer behaviours reinforces us in this choice of direction and has led us in the past year progressively to intensify our actions to deliver this end. This includes not only ensuring a more seamless service for customers but also a business which matches more closely what they want, for example by making our larger stores more compelling destinations in their own right as well as ensuring we offer more convenience stores. Our task is to allocate resources to compete effectively in today's market while giving priority to ensuring that we emerge as winners in the coming multichannel, customer-centric market. Your Board is extremely focused on the need to manage this balance between current and future returns with great care, optimising both without imperilling either. The business is taking decisive steps to free up capital and operational resources, but for the time being the imperative of securing the longer-term future means that our current financial performance remains constrained. Other business priorities In my foreword last year, I said: \" Our strategic choices are defined by three parameters: the strength of the T esco brand: the internet and all the associated developments it is driving: and the potential to leverage our skill and scale internationally... \" I have remarked on the fundamental re-orientation of the business to meet the changes being driven by the internet. Let me say a word about brand: and about how we view our international businesses. Sir Richard Broadbent Chairman Continuity and change This has been an important year for T esco. There has been a great deal to occupy us in relation to current trading as weak markets and intense competition persist. At the same time, we continue to reshape the business to address the fundamental changes taking place in the retail market. The challenging trading conditions of the past year have impacted profits and necessarily remain a focus of management attention. We continue to devote a lot of energy and creativity to creating products and services which customers want to buy at prices they find attractive, through whichever channel they choose and which leave them wanting to visit us again. We have continued to focus on improving the experience for customers with continued investment in colleagues, a big programme of store refurbishment, significant investment in quality and a renewal of product ranges, including the entire finest range, and a continued emphasis on Building a Better T esco in the widest sense of the term. More broadly, however, it has been a year when your company has moved from addressing existing business issues to driving our strategy for future growth and value. There is never a year in which a business focuses solely on one or the other. But it is fair to say that at some point in the past year the balance of where our energies and resources are focused tipped from addressing past issues to investing in the future. We remain focused on the present but we are starting to quicken our pace into the future. \" Being a leading retailer today is not a guarantee of value creation tomorrow. We need to ensure that we are tomorrow's leading retailer. \" com ar2014 to hear more from Sir Richard Broadbent and other members of the leadership team Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 01 Chairman's statement through levels of transparency and disclosure which are undoubtedly now world-leading. We were pleased to welcome Mark Armour to the Board in September last year and the expertise, rooted in a long business career, that he brings to our discussions. We announced on 4 April that Laurie McIlwee had resigned from his position as Chief Financial Officer. I would like to thank Laurie for his contribution to Tesco over the last 14 years. Together with Philip and the wider team, Laurie has played an important role in our process to transform Tesco and position it to be a winner in the new era of retailing. I and the Board wish him every success for the future. Financial results Our task is to deliver value to our shareholders and we hold this goal in mind in all our deliberations. The trade-offs at the present time are not straightforward and we continually track the balance between future value and current return, seeking to ensure an optimum balance between the two in the context of the rapid changes which the retail sector is experiencing. This is reflected in a number of one-off write-offs associated with significant business or market developments and in our results generally which have again been held back by the factors I have described. Revenues from continuing operations were broadly flat and underlying profit fell by 6.9 %. We understand the importance of the dividend to our shareholders and our confidence in the strategic choices we are making is reflected in an unchanged dividend. Conclusion In pursuing our goals, the most important resource we have is our colleagues who are the ones who work unfailingly to anticipate and meet the needs of customers, and I and the whole Board are grateful to each and every one of them for all that they do. The future is a retail world where retailers will need to operate across multiple channels while meeting wholly different customer expectations for service levels, choice, convenience and overall experience. You may be assured that we will compete hard in the current market but the bigger prize we seek on your behalf is to utilise the unique assets and resources of T esco to ensure we emerge as leaders in the future world of retailing. Sir Richard Broadbent Chairman The Tesco brand Re-building the T esco brand to become synonymous again with value, choice and quality, to be seen again as unerringly on the customers' side, is central to our future. In the multichannel world we are moving into, what you are known for will be as important as the channels through which you sell. We have and will continue therefore the patient work to strengthen trust in our brand. This is not without its cost but we believe it is as important an investment as any other part of our strategy. Values are central to any brand and last year we took the major step of introducing a new Value: we use our scale for good. This is evidently a long-term project but the year has seen the first steps taken to embed this sentiment as a touchstone of the business. These are reported in more detail in our separate update of \"T esco and Society\" which is being published alongside this report. International Our priority is to deliver value to our shareholders. The last two years or so have seen us address tough decisions in relation to the international business. That said, we continue to see opportunity to create value internationally by leveraging our skills and scale in relatively rapidly growing economies with less developed modern retail sectors where the rate of economic growth coupled with switching to modern retail outlets can generate attractive returns. Such opportunities need to be taken with focus, flexibility and care. The completion in the past year of our exit from the US underpins the importance of piloting new ventures: of being open to partnership especially in new markets: to selecting rigorously those markets that meet tightly-drawn criteria for investment: and to ensure close management and control of the investments. Many of our choices this year, to enter partnerships in China and India or to invest modestly in an internet start-up in South East Asia, reflect this philosophy of establishing a position of opportunity and testing returns against our criteria as a basis for building long-term, value-enhancing positions. Governance In common with other public companies, we are meeting this year new standards of disclosure. Our Remuneration Policy is set out on pages 41 to 61 for shareholders to consider. Our accounts as a whole have been considered by the Board in the light of the new test to be \"fair, balanced and understandable. \" We have taken seriously the spirit as well as the letter of the new Regulations, which are seeking to build trust between the corporate sector and society generally \" The future is a retail world where retailers will need to operate across multiple channels while meeting wholly different customer expectations for service levels, choice, convenience and overall experience. \" 02 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Chairman's statement continued experiencing and we have focused our resources on building on these strengths. Two years ago, I also outlined plans to deal with the more T esco-specific issues by improving our offer for customers in the UK through a programme of investment in improved service, quality and price. It was important that we started when we did, and this programme of improvement continues and is being accelerated as competitive conditions intensify. With our strategy already in place, we know what we need to do, and we know that we have to do it even more quickly. These issues do mean that our headline numbers are not where we want or planned for them to be. We have taken decisive action to improve performance, but the issues we face cannot all be fixed overnight. We need to do more, we need to go faster. I am, however, confident that we have the right strategies and the right team to compete effectively in the current market and to ensure that we emerge a leader in the multichannel world of retailing. Progress in 2013 14 We laid out our three strategic priorities for the business in April 2013: 1. Continuing to invest in a strong UK business 2. Establishing multichannel leadership in all of our markets 3. Pursuing disciplined international growth These priorities are even more relevant today than they were when I announced them and we have made progress on each of them. Continuing to invest in a strong UK business We launched the Building a Better T esco plan in the UK two years ago and invested PS1 billion in six key areas of the business: Service & Staff, Stores & Formats, Range & Quality, Price & Value, Brand & Marketing and Clicks & Bricks. As I made clear at the time, we had been running our stores 'too hot' for too long and this investment was long-overdue. I have described below some of the progress we have made under each of the areas of the plan. i Service & Staff Having taken on 8,000 more colleagues in our stores, this year we'five focused on providing further customer service training. We have delivered training to more than 250,000 colleagues in the UK, helping them to make every moment with customers matter. We have rescheduled 300,000 hours in the last year with the aim of having the right number of colleagues in our stores, in the right departments and at times of the day that customers need them most. We are seeing improvements in customer perceptions and the proportion of customers Introduction This year marks my 40th year at T esco. I have found every single one of those years exciting and challenging, but I have never seen such a pace of change within the industry as I have over the past year, driven by both structural and cyclical forces. Consumer behaviours are changing more quickly than ever before and that means we have to accelerate our rate of change too. Customers are increasingly using technology in all aspects of their everyday lives and the pace of transition to online shopping has been even faster than we expected. Since taking over as Chief Executive of your business in 2011, I have been clear of the need to transform T esco to be a leader in the multichannel retail environment. The way the market has developed since then has underlined the importance of this strategic choice. At the same time, consumer behaviours continue to be strongly influenced by economic conditions which have continued to be tough in the markets in which we operate. Overall, consumers are spending more carefully. They are increasingly choosing to shop online or in smaller convenience stores rather than in large stores, which presents a particular challenge for T esco given the number of large stores we have around the world. So we face a mix of T esco-specific issues and broader issues affecting the whole sector and it is important that we tackle both. This is a large agenda and has kept us fully occupied over the past year. Thanks to the foresight of my predecessors, over the course of more than 17 years, we'five already developed strong online and convenience businesses. This has ensured we are well-positioned to address the industry-wide changes we are Philip Clarke Chief Executive Our strategy has been developed to drive sustainable growth through three priorities: 1. Pursuing disciplined international growth Further discussion around each of these priorities is provided within my report on the following pages. Our strategic priorities Visit www. com ar2014 to hear more from Philip Clarke and other members of the leadership team Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 03 Report from the Chief Executive Whilst the direct impact of the meat contamination issue last year was limited to just four of our products, we have made marked improvements in the supply chain, shortening its length and focusing on provenance, greater control and traceability. Through our world-class testing programme, we have tested over 5,300 products and we are the first major retailer to offer two-year direct contracts for beef and lamb farmers right back to the farm gate. More than 300 farmers have signed up already. iv Price & Value Customers are actively seeking the best value, and this is more important than ever in a market which has become even more competitive over recent months. It is essential that customers can trust our prices. We want prices to be stable, we want them to be logical and, of course, we want them to be competitive. Our Price Promise has now been in place for over a year and provides instant reassurance to customers that on fresh foods, on own-label and on branded products they will not lose out at T esco. Every customer perception measure on price has improved over the last 12 months, but there is still more to do on pricing. We know how important it is to customers that they get the best possible prices on lines that matter most to them. That is why in February, we announced that we are accelerating the pace of change including an initial investment of PS200 million in bringing down, and keeping down, prices of key lines, starting with milk, carrots, onions and eggs. Y ou can be sure that we will continue to focus relentlessly on ensuring we are competitive in the marketplace and where we need to do more, we will do more. v Brand & Marketing Clubcard is more important now than it has ever been before. It is at the core of providing a differentiated, personalised offer and it allows customers to choose how to unlock greater value for themselves. It is at the heart of our unique relationship with our customers and we need to use the power of Clubcard to personalise how we communicate with and serve our customers, providing them with offers and services which are relevant and tailored to how they live their lives. We are using Clubcard to deliver more value for customers and have delivered almost 60 million personalised mailings this year for products that customers buy week in, week out. A good example of the power of Clubcard and of the advocacy that it can drive is the launch of Clubcard Fuel Save. It is a completely new concept for the UK retail industry. Customers can earn money off their fuel, just by doing their normal shopping. It is inclusive - every penny counts towards the level of saving whether customers are shopping online for their rating customer service and staff helpfulness as excellent has improved by 40% since 2012. We know we need to do more in order to make service a point of difference for us and to deliver excellent customer service for every customer on every shopping trip. This will remain a key priority for the UK business in the coming year. ii Stores & Formats Over the last two years, we have refreshed over a third of our UK stores in some way. This work has involved improvements to store environments and has prioritised the departments that matter most to customers, primarily fresh food. We have applied the learnings from each phase of the refresh programme to the next, enhancing our approach as the programme has evolved. As a result, there are some newer initiatives that we will seek to introduce to some of the stores that formed the early part of the refresh programme. Following the trial stores we completed in 2012 13, our refresh programme to date has been more focused on our Express format and on our smaller Superstores. Given the change in shopping behaviours I mentioned above, our larger stores have been a drag on performance and this is one of the most important areas that we need to address. Therefore, the focus of our refresh programme will now be on reinventing our largest stores to ensure that they are worth the trip for customers. This year we have tested a number of ingredients for our Extra refresh programme, and begun to roll out a range of components to help make these stores relevant destinations that customers actively choose to visit. In 2014 15 we will refresh 110 of our Extra stores, aiming to make them even stronger destinations. More of the ingredients will appear in these larger stores and typically they will feature strong clothing and general merchandise as well as tailored new food experiences, such as Giraffe, Euphorium, Harris Hoole and Decks dependent upon the local customer. We will also be working hard to put 'Food First' and create the best ranges of fresh foods. We are looking forward to accelerating the appearance of these new features in our stores over the next three years. While this refresh work causes some short-term disruption, the resulting uplifts will be long-lasting. iii Range & Quality This year, we completed the work to materially improve our 8,000 core T esco products. Following the relaunch of our finest range in October, we relaunched our Healthy Living range in January. The customer response to the improvements we have made across our T esco products has been pleasing, and our own-label sales account for around half of our total UK sales excluding petrol. This year, we completed the work to materially improve our 8,000 core T esco products. \" We want prices to be stable, we want them to be logical and, of course, we want them to be competitive. \" 04 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Report from the Chief Executive continued T matter most, more product innovation and quality improvements that delight, new and improved general merchandise ranges and more Extra stores becoming destinations worth a trip in their own right, while our convenience stores will be best in class. Our attention to service levels will intensify and we will deliver exceptional value for customers through Clubcard, just as we are doing through the recent launch of Clubcard Fuel Save. It is this combination of accelerating growth in new channels while investing in sharper prices, improved quality, stronger ranges and better service that places a strain on short-term results. But it is also this combination of actions and strategic choice that will deliver sustainable long-term value. Where we have moved - for example in ending the UK space race, in focusing on cash and capital discipline, in developing grocery home shopping - others in the sector have followed. Our aim is to continue to lead, recognising that structural change on this scale is a long game and it is in our interest - and your interest - to be a long-term winner. Establishing multichannel leadership in all of our markets Against the backdrop of an accelerating shift to online shopping, our priority of establishing multichannel leadership in all of our markets has never been more relevant. Customers' behaviours are changing, their expectations of retailers continue to rise and they want to be able to shop however, whenever and wherever they want. We are moving from the first curve of retailing - one of bricks and mortar - to the second curve built around a seamless blend of bricks and clicks. Establishing multichannel leadership is about putting the customer at the centre of our offer and building a seamless experience around them, whether they want to shop in store, online, in our restaurants, at the Bank or across a combination of them all. Customer journeys are becoming more complex. Customers bounce between channels and devices in whichever way they choose and they expect a seamless experience. Our goal is to provide a zero-defect, end-to-end experience however our customers want to shop. While this presents challenges, it brings lots of opportunities too. Our scale, and our existing strengths from the first curve world, mean we are uniquely placed to lead in this new world. It is clear to us that those customers who choose to shop across more channels with us spend more and are more loyal to T esco. Identifying our most valuable customers and enabling them to shop with us however, whenever and wherever they want is our opportunity. We have some ambitious goals and bold plans for our multichannel business in weekly shop or popping in store for a sandwich, and they are in control of when they redeem their saving too. In just the first few weeks, more than three million customers saved money on fuel. Clubcard Fuel Save is one example of the things we are doing to improve loyalty. Loyalty has always been important to T esco because greater loyalty delivers greater lifetime value. vi Clicks & Bricks As I have already referenced, the pace of the transition to online is rapid. This creates challenges for the industry but we have a market-leading, profitable grocery home shopping business that already generates PS2.5 billion of sales in the UK. By any measure our service is industryleading, and it represents a world-class platform from which to build our position of leadership in the multichannel world. Our Delivery Saver subscription service, which only launched in May 2012, is used by over 200,000 customers. We offer one-hour delivery slots in over 98% of the UK and Grocery Click & Collect is available at 260 locations. T esco has always been about making products previously seen as unattainable more accessible. So we were especially proud of the launch of Hudl - our very own tablet - which made tablet devices much more accessible to more families across the UK. It proved extremely popular with customers, exceeding our own expectations, and earned outstanding reviews from the technology press. It was recently named 'ReThink Retail T echnology Initiative of the Y ear' at the Retail Week Awards and we plan to launch a second device later this year. Accelerating our plans for customers in the UK I am clear that we have strengthened the foundations of the UK business, but I am also clear that we need to do more. Above all else, we are focused on delivering the most compelling offer for customers and we are accelerating our plans. Consequently, over the coming months you will see a continuing focus on every day low prices on the lines that \" The pace of the transition to online is rapid. This creates challenges for the industry but we have a market-leading, profitable grocery home shopping business. \" \" A good example of the power of Clubcard and of the advocacy that it can drive is the launch of Clubcard Fuel Save. \" Establishing multichannel leadership is about putting the customer at the centre of our offer and building a seamless experience around them, whether they want to shop in a store, online, in our restaurants, at the Bank or across a combination of them all. Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 05 Our work, however, to refresh seven of our largest stores, including our stores in Dongsuwon and Yuseong, has delivered encouraging results. We also continued to grow our convenience portfolio, with the opening of 71 '365 plus' franchise stores. We have had a challenging year in Thailand, reflecting the impact of the recessionary conditions on consumers and the political unrest. Thailand is one of our largest international markets and we have implemented a strong plan to improve our offer. We have continued to build a strong multichannel business, growing our grocery home shopping and convenience businesses to almost 1,400 convenience stores. In Malaysia, our performance has been more resilient. We opened two new stores during the year and grew our grocery home shopping business in its first year of operation. In Europe, we faced weak momentum running into the start of the year and the challenges were common across our markets with larger stores under-performing. Addressing these challenges we have tailored our plans in each market to provide a more compelling fresh offer, focusing on seasonal events and leveraging our sourcing scale and supply chain capability. We have also used our strengths in Clubcard and F&F to drive further improvements in our offer for customers. Turkey in particular has faced very challenging economic and competitive conditions and our focus is on finding a profitable model for a country with excellent long-term potential. We are in early stage discussions with potential partners and, should that not prove successful, we also have a range of realistic alternative options. An excellent example of our strategy in action is our partnership with China Resources Enterprise Ltd. Subject to the usual regulatory approvals, it will give T esco a 20% ownership stake of the largest food retail business in China. The joint venture, which will be self-funding going forward, will secure significant cost and operational synergies, and will move us more quickly to profitability in what is one of the world' s most exciting retail markets alongside an expert local partner. We have entered into an agreement with Trent Limited, part of the T ata Group, to form a 50:50 joint venture with Trent Hypermarket Limited, developing our presence in the Indian market. We firmly believe that our partnerships in both China and India will allow us to capitalise on these enormously exciting markets in a way which is disciplined in our use of capital and focused on profitable growth. 2014 15: to provide market-leading delivery pricing, twice the number of Click & Collect locations, including alternative locations such as London tube stations, and added-value products and services, including T esco Bank's current account and digital wallet. In the medium term, we will offer one-hour delivery slots to the whole of the UK, for non-food as well as food, and for third-party sellers as well as our own products. By doing so, we will effectively create an e-commerce infrastructure not just for T esco but for others as well. It is because we have the potential to innovate on this scale that we believe your company will emerge a winner in the coming multichannel world of retailing. Pursuing disciplined international growth Last year, I described our international markets in three cohorts: South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand - markets with significant future potential Ireland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - markets where we are focused on holding our position and improving returns China, India and Turkey - markets where we know we must refocus on a more profitable approach to growth Through our international businesses we have the opportunity to create value for customers and shareholders by leveraging the know-how that we have gained from nine decades of retailing in addition to using our scale to better effect across the Group. As well as doing even more to improve our customer offer across all our markets, we'five taken action to ensure that this value is realised across each of these three cohorts. In line with our third strategic priority, we have applied an even greater level of capital discipline. While we continue to allocate capital to markets where we see greatest potential for growth, our investment is lower than previous years and will fall even further as part of our commitment that Group-wide capital expenditure will be no more than PS2.5 billion for at least the next three financial years. We are spending more on our existing space due to our accelerated refresh programme, we are maintaining our level of spend on technology and we're spending significantly less on new space. T aking our Asian businesses first, we have a strong position in South Korea and it remains a high-returning business for us, but the sales trends have not been as we would have wanted them to be in the last two years. The regulatory restrictions on store opening hours have continued to impact our sales. \" Through our international businesses we have the opportunity to create value for customers and shareholders by leveraging the know-how that we have gained from nine decades of retailing. \" 06 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Report from the Chief Executive continued throughout the business. One of the biggest changes we have made over the last year is in the scale of our engagement. We are joining the global conversation around each of the issues and are working hard to move to a more open, transparent conversation, sharing details of our activities, progress and challenges through our different channels. We want to make significant, lasting changes, not launch short-term superficial initiatives, and that's why the focus of this year has been gathering the best possible insights to set long-term direction. This insight-to-action approach holds the key to our success for the future. It's the theme of this year's T esco and Society report, which is published alongside this report. I'm confident that if we continue down this path over the coming years, we can use our scale for good across society and make what matters better, together. Management I would like to thank Laurie McIlwee for his contribution as CFO over the last five years, in particular to the progress we have made on our strategic priorities in the last three years, and before that his very good work on UK distribution. I wish him all the best for the future. Our Executive Committee has grown stronger this year, welcoming Steve Rigby and David Hobbs, and I am confident that we have the right team to deliver our strategy. Conclusion While we do face short-term challenges, I am excited about the future. We see many more opportunities for the medium term and beyond. As customers' expectations of retailers evolve and we move into the new era of retail, we believe we are uniquely placed to lead. T esco has always innovated for its customers. We have the building blocks which will be essential for us to lead in the future: an industry-leading online offer, unrivalled customer insight through Clubcard, a first-class portfolio of stores, and an outstanding team of over 500,000 colleagues around the world who are working harder every day to deliver for our customers. In a rapidly changing market, retaining flexibility is essential and we are confident that we have a business plan which is right for today's market, and that we are making the strategic decisions to deliver leadership in tomorrow's market. Philip Clarke Chief Executive Measuring our progress The single most important theme running through all the developments I have discussed is that stores are no longer necessarily the central point of our relationship with customers. Consequently we are re-orientating the indicators we use to measure and judge our progress to centre them firmly on the customer. Our customers are at the centre of all our strategic decisions. Quite simply, everything we are doing is designed to retain our loyal customers and attract more new ones who shop across our channels and brands. That is how companies build enduring like-for-like sales. We are prioritising five key performance indicators which will help us measure and communicate our progress against our strategy. These measures place customers, and how they want to shop today right at the heart of everything we do. Focusing on driving customer loyalty and improving sales will lead to sustainable profits, returns and growth over the medium term. Y ou can read more about our new key performance indicators and how we are measuring performance of the business on pages 16 to 18. Tesco Bank Our vision is to be the bank for T esco customers and to offer simple, transparent and convenient products which reward our customers' loyalty and strengthen their bond with our business. This year we have seen good growth in our core banking products with customer accounts for credit cards, loans, mortgages and savings up 14%. In its first full year of trading, our mortgage product has made good progress with balances reaching PS0.7 billion. We remain on track to launch current accounts in the first half of 2014 15. Using our scale for good Last year we embraced a new Value for the business, recognising that when you are a large company, there is a particular responsibility to be aware of how your actions affect others. This Value is: we use our scale for good. It is based on the recognition that if we harness the breadth of our skills and scale and work together with our partners in the supply chain, we can make a major contribution to some of the biggest challenges facing the communities in which we operate, across the world. As part of this, we chose to take a lead in addressing three challenges which are particularly relevant to us as a large global retailer and are important to our colleagues and customers: reducing food waste globally, improving health and providing opportunities for millions of young people. We have started the journey of tackling these issues and we are embedding this new Value For more information about our new key performance indicators and how we are measuring our progress, see pages 16 to 18. \" We firmly believe that our partnerships in both China and India will allow us to capitalise on these enormously exciting markets in a way which is disciplined in our use of capital and focused on profitable growth. \" Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 07 % 50 40 30 20 10 Jan '11 Jan '14 Jan '12 Jan '13 Jan '09 Jan '10 Macro trends Consumer trends 29% in 2009 49% in 2013 PS Get better Get worse of UK customers use a mobile phone to compare prices or look up customer reviews while in store As customers increasingly choose to shop across different store formats and online, they are looking to retailers to provide a truly seamless, multichannel offer. These changes to customer behaviour and shopping habits come in the context of continuing economic pressure on household budgets and competitive environments in all 12 of our markets. T echnology is changing the way we consume. The role that it plays in customers' lives has changed as it becomes a fundamental, essential part of everyday life - a way to stay connected, to manage banking and bills, a part of education and often essential for work. While the pace of adoption of online shopping, particularly for groceries, across our markets is unclear, the transition is certainly well underway. It is not just transactional - consumers are increasingly using the internet to research purchases. In the UK, for example, over half of purchases are influenced by digital channels, 63% of shoppers use their smartphone in store and 43% of customers use a mobile phone to compare prices or look up customer reviews while shopping in store. The influence of the internet is rising across all our markets: two thirds of Malaysians have access to the internet, for example, while almost half of Czechs own a smartphone. Technology is changing the way we consume. The role that it plays in customers' lives has changed from being a practical tool to becoming a much more fundamental and essential part of life. UK consumers: how do you expect the financial position of your household to change over the next few months? The rise of technology Proportion of UK customers shopping three or more times a week for food and groceries 43% More frequent shopping In the UK, we use our unique insight from dunnhumby to track how British consumers feel about the economy in general, as well as their own individual situations. Our latest quarterly Consumer T oday report shows that although some consumers are starting to feel more upbeat about an improving economy, they are yet to feel the benefit in their own pockets. That is why we remain very focused on helping customers to manage their budgets by offering them great value for money across their shop. In Central Europe, after a prolonged period of economic pressure, employment levels and consumer confidence are rising, albeit from historically low levels, and real incomes are starting to benefit from lower inflation. Nonetheless, household expenditure is yet to improve significantly. Although some economies in Asia are rapidly expanding, Thailand fell into recession during the year and consumers struggled with higher levels of debt. Thai consumer confidence was further affected by the escalation of political unrest in the second half of the year. In South Korea consumer confidence has been on a marked upward trend through the year but household debt has reached record highs. Consumer confidence in Malaysia has fallen due to concerns over inflation, low wage growth and a proposed sales tax. Populations are ageing and household sizes are declining across our markets. In Asia for example, 50% of South Korean households comprise one or two people - a trend also seen in Thailand, in part due to rapid urbanisation. This changing household composition is one factor leading to an increasing preference for convenience shopping. We believe that in the longer term rising populations, rapid urbanisation and a growing demand for agricultural products present a risk to global food security and highlight the importance of building sustainable supply chains. More information about our work to increase the sustainability of our supply chain is available in the T esco and Society Report. Source: 'The Consumer T oday', dunnhumby, February 2014 The economic environment has continued to be challenging in all of our markets. Although there are signs of improvement beginning to appear, we don't yet see consumers spending more. 08 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Market overview 2009 Source: IGD Datacentre 6,000 5,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 0 '000 sq ft 2010 2011 2012 2013 In-store only In-store online grocery In-store online grocery general merchandise online Average annual spend with T esco In-store General merchandise online Online grocery 2.98x 2.04x Multichannel Net new space Industry trends 38% less new space than in 2009 Multichannel cuts across the digital and the physical. It is transactional and non-transactional. It is not just about selling products but also about the way we interact with and engage customers. Being truly multichannel is not just about having a website - it is about putting the customer at the heart of our business and giving them one seamless, joined-up relationship, be that through media, social media or even a customer service desk in store. Customers value retailers who get it right In the UK, food retail sales growth has remained subdued over the last year, reflecting the challenging economic environment and continuing pressure on consumers. Although new space has been a key driver of top-line growth for many in the industry, we have seen a reduction in large store openings. In the UK net new space among the largest four grocery retailers in 2013 was 38% lower than in 2009. In many of our markets performance of larger stores has been more challenged. In response to a consumer desire to shop more frequently and closer to home, many retailers are focusing their opening programmes on the convenience market and smaller format stores. An acceleration in openings of small format stores is something we have also observed in our European and Asian markets. In the UK the online grocery market has continued to grow strongly, with all the major UK food retailers now operating a grocery home shopping service. We have also seen a rapid growth in Click & Collect over the last year, including trials of non-store collection locations. While online grocery is still in its infancy in Central Europe and Asia we expect it to continue to grow. In Poland, for example, the value of the online food market doubled in size from 2008 to 2011, and is expected to have more than doubled again by 2014. Across our markets the industry remains highly competitive. In the UK and Europe the discounters continue to grow market share and open new stores. Promotional intensity has remained elevated in the UK and couponing has been a feature in many of our markets. We have seen continued development of own-brand products by retailers across the globe as they seek to appeal to broader groups of consumers and respond to demand for better value. In the UK, food retail sales growth has remained subdued over the last year, reflecting the challenging economic environment and continuing pressure on consumers. With this rise of technology and digital capabilities, consumers are changing the way they shop. Customers want to be able to shop however, whenever and wherever they want. They want to shop across store formats, on smartphones and on tablets. They are no longer choosing just a simple trip to a store, but are making much more dynamic and complex journeys to purchase. They are bouncing between channels, placing an order online and picking it up in store, for example. They are combining fewer big shopping trips with more frequent, top-up shops at convenience stores. As their behaviour is changing their expectations UK largest four grocery retailers of retailers are changing too and they are looking to retailers to provide a truly multichannel offer - one that joins up all the different channels to give them a seamless experience. Value continues to be a priority for consumers across our markets and they are changing the way they shop in order to find the best value for money. They are on the look-out for the best prices, promotions and deals. The sharp rises in fuel prices across the world coupled with pressure on disposable income has amplified a shift to smaller, more frequent, convenience shopping missions. In the UK, the proportion of customers shopping three or more times a week for food and groceries is up from 29% in 2009 to 49% in 2013. Health and wellbeing is also a growing trend. Over half of the UK population worry about their health and food is at the centre. Quality fresh food and provenance are priorities for customers across our regions. In Europe and the UK, interest in and awareness of provenance have intensified since the meat contamination issues last year. In Asia wet-markets continue to be a popular choice for fresh meat, fish and poultry.

Our key enablers make us unique and help us to continually do these things better. com businessmodel to watch a short animation explaining how our business model works 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Business model The key enablers T As a retailer, our business model is based on four core activities. Using our unrivalled insight to understand what customers want, we buy products and services from suppliers, move them through our distribution network and sell them to customers. Most importantly, our core purpose is at the heart of these activities. It is by improving these activities for customers each time they shop with us that we make what matters better, together. Across the Group, our customers visit us in store, online, or through a combination of different formats and channels. They come to buy their groceries, clothing, general merchandise and services such as telecoms, digital entertainment and banking. We are focused on providing customers with the most compelling offer and the best shopping trip. We work with our suppliers to offer an excellent range of products and services. We move the products through our modern and efficient supply chain into our well-located, multi-format store network, ready for customers to shop with us 24 hours a day. The core activities form a cycle. T o keep customers coming back, we are constantly strengthening our operation. We listen to customers in a number of ways, including through our monthly Customer Viewpoint surveys in UK stores, in-depth focus groups with our T esco Families and dedicated Customer Question Time sessions. Combining this feedback with our data, including the unique insight we gain from Clubcard, and acting on it is crucial to our success. Our seven key enablers are our business strengths. They help us to sustain and improve our core activities. These elements are what make us different and it's because of these that we are uniquely placed to win. For example, establishing multichannel leadership and building a seamless offer will enable customers to shop however, whenever and wherever they want, which will mean that we stand out for customers. Another example is leveraging our Group skill and scale, which is all about sharing our experiences across our operations. We trial in one area of the business and transfer the learnings to another, whether it's sharing the loyalty scheme blueprint internationally or building capital-efficient grocery home shopping businesses in new markets. Being able to leverage our Group skill and scale makes us unique and helps us to perform the core activities even better. The momentum of our business model comes from the virtuous circle. By developing economies of scale and investing in an ever-improving customer offer, we drive loyalty and grow sales. Developing and using economies of scale across our business all over the world, enables us to improve the customer offer by investing in areas such as price, range, quality and service. This year, for example, we completed the roll-out of grocery home shopping to all of our markets except India. It is a service we developed in the UK and have rolled out in a capital-efficient way to our international businesses, with a great customer response. Doing the right thing for customers is central to the business model. It's why one of our Values is 'no-one tries harder for customers': we know that if we do the right thing for customers, they will reward us with their loyalty. The more pleased customers are with the shopping trip, the more loyal they will be and the more we will grow our sales. This combination of scale and growth is the driving force of the business model. 38 million Clubcard customers shopping in our 7,300 stores across the Group give us unrivalled insight into consumer habits, trends and preferences. 59.7% of our UK customers shop across two or more channels, including stores and online. 12 markets with retail operations delivering 85 million customer shopping trips each week.

From an accounting point of view, our existing business in China has to be treated as a discontinued operation, prior to the planned completion of our partnership with CRE. The pro-forma Group ROCE of 12.1% includes our Chinese business to provide a comparable figure to the previously disclosed 2012 13 figure. It is otherwise calculated on a continuing operations basis, excluding one-off charges. Excluding our Chinese business, Group ROCE for 2013 14 was 13.6%. Group results and strategic update Group sales for the year were PS70.9 billion, an increase of 0.3% at actual exchange rates. Full-year trading profit for our continuing operations declined 6.0 % to PS3.3 billion. This was driven by a decline in UK profits and challenges overseas: specifically, the regulatory impact in South Korea, political disruption in Thailand and continuing challenging conditions in Central Europe. Underlying profit before tax 1, which excludes the contribution from property-related items, declined 6.9 % to PS3.1 billion. Underlying diluted earnings per share was 32.05 pence. During the year, we concluded our strategic review in the United States with the sale of the substantive part of Fresh & Easy's operating business to Yucaipa. We also announced our partnership with China Resources Enterprise Ltd. CRE, which when completed will give T esco a 20% ownership stake in the largest food retail business in China. Both of those operations are therefore shown as discontinued. Reflecting the challenging trading conditions and rapidly changing environments, we have also announced a number of one-off charges. PS 801 million 2 of these are in continuing operations. These include: A non-cash impairment of PS 734 million to the carrying values of some stores in the Europe segment. An additional PS 63 million provision for payment protection insurance and other customer redress at the Bank. Our statutory profit before tax for the year was PS2.3 billion. Despite these charges and a lower contribution from profits and losses on property-related items, Group profit before tax increased by 9.8%, primarily reflecting higher one-off charges last year.

This prudently reflects the lower end of a range of independent valuations of the proposed combination carried out in the second half of the year for accounting purposes. These valuations were, as required by the relevant accounting standards, produced on a standalone existing basis for each business. As such, they do not take account of the strategic value and significant synergies available once the businesses are merged. Segmental results UK Full-year sales in the UK declined by 0.1 % and grew by 0.8% excluding petrol. Like-for-like sales declined by 1.3 % including VAT and excluding petrol. This reflects the weaker grocery market, lower inflation across the industry, a continuing drag from our large stores and the work to transform our general merchandise.

We expect it to be lower again next year. Our full-year trading margin was 5.03%, a reduction of 18 basis points. Trading margin in the first half increased by 2 basis points, but declined by 28 basis points in the second half. This is reflective of our trading performance and our determination to improve and strengthen the customer offer. Asia Although we have strong high-returning businesses in Asia with leading market positions, their performance this year reflects a number of challenges. Sales grew by 1.4% at constant rates, including a 5.9% contribution from new stores as we continue to invest in these growth markets. Like-for-like sales declined by 4.5 % and our trading margin declined by almost 60 basis points to 6.71%.

China, with our subsidiary there now treated as a discontinued operation following our agreement to partner with CRE. Although we have annualised the introduction of the DIDA opening hours regulations in South Korea, year-on-year changes in the days and hours of the closures have continued to impact sales. We have worked hard to mitigate the residual effects of the regulation by fully aligning our operations to the current pattern of trading. In Thailand, our performance has been held back by our own execution as well as external pressures. We implemented a strong plan, including steps to address some parts of our offer which underperformed in the first half. This included the remerchandising and remarketing of our 'Clubpack' range of bulk buy products, a particularly important category for small traders who shop with us. The Thai economy also fell into recession during the year and this has since been compounded by the recent political unrest. The full-year numbers for Asia benefited from currency, but in the fourth quarter we saw a negative impact, driven by the Thai Baht. Whilst it is difficult to predict currency movements going forward, this impact has continued into the new financial year. South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand remain markets in which we see significant future potential and opportunities to invest in high-returning stores. We have opened 2.1 million square feet of new space in these markets this year, a reduction compared to the 2.3 million we opened last year. In the coming year we intend to be even more focused with plans to open 1.2 million square feet, with much of it in convenience. Europe Conditions in Europe have remained challenging this year, particularly for our large stores. Sales declined 2.0 % at constant rates. Like-forlike sales declined by 3.5 % excluding petrol. Our trading profit for the region declined by 27.7 % at actual exchange rates to PS238 million, resulting in a 2.57% trading margin. Our decision to invest in the shopping trip through price, quality, range and service resulted in a stronger second half performance. The region's like-for-like sales have improved through the year, from 5.5 % in the first quarter to 0.6 % in the fourth quarter. Reflecting the year-on-year decline in the profits of our European businesses, we revised our long-term budgets. These revisions have resulted in the asset impairment of PS 734 million to the carrying value of these businesses.

Ireland has continued to be a difficult market this year with severe pressure on consumer spending, strong competition from the discounters and aggressive couponing activity. Although the launch of Price Promise in the second half has helped improve customer trust in our prices, and we have been working hard to show customers the breadth and points of difference in our offer, our weaker trading performance in this market has impacted on the profitability of our European segment. We have continued to focus on the heartland of our business in T urkey and the stores there have contributed to a gradual improvement in like-for-like sales over the year. Nevertheless, addressing our position in T urkey is very much a priority. We continue to be very disciplined in our allocation of capital to Europe. We have reduced capital expenditure in the region by nearly 40% this year, and expect to maintain a similar or lower level of spend in 2014 15. Going forward, new investment will be scarce and focused only on targeted opportunities, primarily in convenience and online. Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 13 We are spending significantly less on new space. In the UK we have already reduced our investment from 2.5 million square feet at peak. In the coming year, we will open just 0.9 million square feet of net new space. This includes almost 200,000 square feet of franchise space in One Stop. In Europe, we will open just 275,000 square feet of net new space and focus more of our investment on high-returning opportunities in Asia. Property The market value of our property across the Group currently exceeds PS34 billion, with the most significant driver of the reduction since last year being the impact of foreign exchange rates. Historically, by acquiring and developing high-quality stores we grew the value of our property significantly and unrealised property profits built up. We have had an active programme of releasing value from our property portfolio over many years. We continue to look at our property portfolio in order to maximise value in the most appropriate way for the business as a whole. Excluding one-off items, profits arising from property-related items declined to PS180 million this year, in line with the reduction of our sale and leaseback programme outlined last year. This year we have focused on South Korea and we completed a sale-and-leaseback in January comprising four Homeplus stores and accompanying mall space. Pension Our pension is an extremely valuable benefit for colleagues and one we are proud to offer. IFRS accounting gives a marked-tomarket measure of our pension liabilities, based on market conditions which of course can be volatile in the short term, whereas the liabilities are clearly long-term in nature. Our after-tax IAS 19 pension deficit this year has risen to PS2.6 billion, mainly due to a reduction in real corporate bond yields with a subsequent fall in the discount rate used to measure our liabilities. A triennial actuarial valuation will be carried out to measure our liabilities as at 31 March 2014 and this will be completed in 2015. Return on capital employed When we complete our partnership with CRE, our Group return on capital employed will reflect our share of the partnership's assets and profits or losses. Given that we expect to complete the partnership in the first half of 2014 15 we have given a pro-forma Group ROCE including our Chinese business. On this basis, our Group ROCE was 12.1%, which is a comparable figure to the 12.7% we reported last year. Excluding our Chinese business based on its current accounting treatment as a discontinued operation, our Group ROCE would be 13.6%. The UK continues to earn the highest returns in the Group and our businesses in Asia are high-returning. Europe's returns remain below cost of capital. We will continue to limit capital expenditure in this region and focus our efforts on improving our offer for customers in existing stores. Tesco Bank Tesco Bank generated PS194 million trading profit this year. Excluding income from the legacy insurance distribution agreement which terminated in 2012 13 and fair value releases resulting from the unwind of an acquisition accounting adjustment, it grew by 19%. We have seen good growth in our core banking products with customer accounts for credit cards, loans, mortgages and savings up 14%. After the first full year of trading, mortgage balances have grown to PS0.7 billion and we have helped over 4,000 customers to own their homes. Those customers have borrowed an average of just under PS170,000 with a loan-to-value ratio of just over 50%. Reflecting the challenging market conditions, with increased competition driving a marked reduction in premiums across the industry, the profit contribution of our Insurance business was down 17 % this year excluding legacy income. Tesco Bank results PSm % growth Tesco Bank revenue exc. impact of IFRIC 13 PS1,003m 1.8 % Tesco Bank trading profit PS194m 1.6% Tesco Bank trading margin trading profit revenue 19.34% 63bp The Bank will soon complete its suite of products with a current account launching in the first half. We expect the growth in underlying trading profit in 2014 15 to be broadly offset by the investment in current accounts. Within one-off items, the Bank has made a further increase to the provision for payment protection insurance of PS 20 million and a provision of PS 43 million for other customer redress. The Bank's balance sheet remains strong with good levels of liquidity. Although customer deposits remain the primary source of funding, the funding base was diversified during the year with a credit card securitisation and participation in the Funding for Lending scheme. Group balance sheet and cash flow Net debt has remained stable year-on-year at PS6.6 billion. In the context of declining underlying profit, lower property proceeds and a maintained dividend, this demonstrates our discipline and focus on cash. Two metrics that we use to guide our internal decisions and which support our discipline to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating are net indebtedness and fixed charge cover. This year net indebtedness rose slightly to 3.16 times and fixed charge cover remained stable at 3.4 times. This year we spent PS2.7 billion of capex, or PS3.0 billion including China. We are reducing our capital expenditure to no more than PS2.5 billion for at least the next three years. A greater proportion of this reduced overall spend is devoted to our existing stores. We are accelerating our refresh programme in the UK and we are also maintaining our level of spend on technology to ensure that we have the necessary capabilities for a truly multichannel offer. 14 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Financial review continued After 14 years' service at Tesco, Laurie resigned as Chief Financial Officer on 4 April 2014. Our approach to growth and returns We laid out this financial framework in April 2013 and it continues to inform our decisions. The framework helps ensure an appropriate balance of growth, returns and cash generation, and outlines what shareholders can expect from T esco from a financial perspective in the medium term. The changes we have announced to capital expenditure underpin our commitment to this framework. This moves capital expenditure to the bottom of our 4% down to 3.5% of sales guiderail. This even greater focus on capital discipline will help maintain the commitment to generate positive free cash flow, maintain a strong balance sheet, and continue to maintain a strong dividend. I wish Philip and the team well and am absolutely confident that T esco will emerge from this period of unprecedented change in the industry stronger than ever.

Our investments in the customer offer are designed to create long-term value for new customers too. Our customers can shop how they want 4. Our customers use us for more 59.7% customers shopping across channels 64.3% shop the family brands Definition: Percentage of loyal customers who in the last 13 weeks have shopped two or more channels Commentary: This measure helps us to monitor whether we are providing the truly multichannel offer that customers want in the new era of retailing. We know that customers who shop across channels spend more with us and this measure tracks whether they are shopping between different sized stores, grocery online and services. Definition: Percentage of loyal customers who in the last 13 weeks have bought held products from Bank, T elecoms, Clothing Commentary: Our multichannel, multibrand strategy is founded in the belief that the whole is more than the sum of the parts. This measure tracks whether we are building loyalty and value across our brands and channels. Loved by customers Our final measure is one of customer advocacy. Whilst the first four are functional measures, we know that for our brand to be loved, liked or actively chosen, our emotional connection with our customers must get stronger. Emotionally loyal customers, advocates and fans become brilliant ambassadors and drive word of mouth, as well as engaging more broadly and deeply with the business. There are many different ways of measuring advocacy, not least using a net promoter score, but they all add up to something similar - do customers like you enough to recommend you to others? With our strategy now focused on delivering even greater loyalty from our customers, we place even greater emphasis across the business on improving five customer-focused key performance indicators. Whilst we continue to track a range of financial and non-financial measures, it is these five which each of our businesses now uses to gauge progress. Key performance indicators of our strategic performance We have entered the new, multichannel world of retail and customers' expectations have changed. Customers have increased access to more and more retailers simply at their search bar on their smartphone and our success will be a result of more customers choosing T esco in preference to others. As a result of this fundamental change, we have prioritised our customer-focused measures to track and communicate our progress against the strategy. We believe these five KPIs are more relevant today, during this time of transition and transformation, than some of our historical and short-term measures. Everything we are doing to create the most compelling offer is designed to retain our most loyal customers, attract new ones and allow them to shop however, whenever and wherever they want to. These measures both allow us to monitor our progress and to create value because they are entirely focused on customers and how they choose to shop. Greater loyalty delivers greater lifetime value so we are tracking the behaviours of our loyal Clubcard customers - those who are most engaged and typically spend more with us. Focusing on our loyal customers is how we are driving the transformation we are going through and is how we will build enduring like-for-like sales. The measures contained in this section are for our core UK business where they are particularly relevant. They do however apply to every part of our business - whether it's a store, a category, a country or a department - and we are using them across the Group to drive the behaviours that we believe will lead to long-term success. Loyal customers are defined based on their frequency of spend and average weekly spend. Channels include: large stores, convenience stores, grocery home shopping, T esco Direct and Wine by the case. Current results do not include Blinkbox, Clothing online, Nutricentre, Dobbies and our new coffee shops and restaurants. These will be tracked going forward. 16 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Key performance indicators Times 6 4 2 12 13 11 12 10 11 09 10 08 09 13 14 11 12 09 10 05 06 07 08 03 04 13 14 % 8 6 4 2 12 13 13 14 12.7% 12.1% Times 4 3 2 1 12 13 11 12 10 11 09 10 08 09 13 14 Group performance Group financial ratios Measures of current financial performance Growth in underlying profit before tax 6.9 % Return on capital employed 'ROCE' 12.1% Growth in underlying diluted earnings per share at a constant tax rate 7.3 % 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 14 10.8% 2.6% 14.4 % 7.3 % 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 14 12.3% 2.1% 14.9 % 6.9 % Performance Our underlying profit performance this year reflects weaker market conditions in the UK, difficult trading conditions in Europe, the impact of opening hours regulations in South Korea and a weak economy in Thailand. The 2012 13 figure including China was 14.5 %. Performance Group ROCE was 12.1% as a result of our profit performance. Given that we expect to complete the partnership with CRE this year, we have given a pro-forma ROCE including our Chinese business. This is directly comparable to last year's published figure. Excluding China based on its current accounting treatment as a discontinued operation, our ROCE would be 13.6%. Performance The decline in our underlying diluted earnings per share, which is adjusted for the number of shares in issue, is in line with our underlying profit performance.

This is largely as a result of our actions to impair asset values in Europe and goodwill in China. 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 14 1 year 0.2 % 18.7 % 22.5% 6.3 % 5 year 6.7% 3.0 % 2.1% 3.7% Performance TSR improved on an annualised, five-year basis, reflecting the impact of the economic crisis in 2008 09 and our efforts to strengthen the business since. On a one-year basis the total shareholder return was 6.3 % which reflects a declining share price. Performance Our net indebtedness has remained broadly stable at 3.16 times, reflecting our focus on cash and capital discipline. Capital expenditure 'capex' as % of sales 3.9% Performance Capex was PS2.7 billion, a similar level to 2012 13 on a continuing operations basis. It fell significantly in Europe and the UK and increased in Asia, in line with our priority for disciplined international growth. The 2012 13 figure including China was 4.1%. Fixed charge cover Performance Our stable fixed charge cover ratio reflects the strength of the Group's underlying cash profits and our focus on managing both our debt profile and fixed charges. All KPIs on pages 17 and 18 apart from return on capital employed, gearing, TSR, net indebtedness and fixed charge cover exclude the results from our operations in the United States and China for 2012 13 and 2013 14, with the exception of reduction in CO 2 e emissions which includes China.

Reduction in CO 2 e emissions from existing stores and distribution centres Partner viewpoint - percentage of positive responses to the question 'I am treated with respect' Donation of pre-tax profits to charities and good causes Performance As indicated in the 2012 13 Annual Report, we are now measuring the cumulative reduction in CO 2 e across our property against a 2006 7 baseline, consistent with our 2020 target to halve the emissions per square foot of our stores and DCs. The reduction continues to be driven by our strong focus on reducing refrigerant gas leakage and using less harmful alternatives, including natural refrigerants. 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 14 n a n a 32.5% 34.7% Performance This year we fulfilled our commitment to improve our anonymous partner viewpoint survey by making it more comprehensive and ensuring it reaches more suppliers. The survey is helping us to understand more about how our supplier partners are feeling, and allows us to focus on the categories and countries where we need to work harder to ensure we always treat our partners with respect. We are committed to building longer-term strong strategic relationships, and our teams are very focused on improving this score. Performance We have donated almost PS53 million to charities and good causes this year through direct donations, cause-related marketing, gifts in kind, colleague time and management costs. This represents 2.3% of our statutory profit before tax. The total that we have donated is lower this year, largely due to the transition from T esco for Schools and Clubs to our Eat Happy initiative.

We have a responsibility to respect the human rights of our colleagues, our customers, the communities we operate in and the people who work throughout our supply chain. Our approach We are committed to upholding basic human rights and support in full the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization Core Conventions. We were a founding member of the Ethical Trading Initiative and expect all our suppliers to work towards fully implementing the base code. We investigate allegations of human rights infringements and take appropriate action where necessary. T o review our policy visit www. In addressing human rights we consider our potential impacts on the following groups as a priority: Our colleagues: Our people policies are designed to make Tesco a great place to work where everyone is welcome Our supply chain: Building strong partnerships with trusted suppliers will ensure that we deliver high-quality and safe products that are responsibly produced Our customers and the communities in which we operate: Our customers want to buy high-quality products that are produced safely and responsibly. We want to be a good neighbour wherever we operate. Through our scale for good strategy we are addressing some of the key challenges that societies are facing which are closely aligned to specific human rights as defined by the UN. For example: Right to education - we are working to provide opportunities for millions of young people Right to be free from hunger - we are building close relationships with food banks and food surplus charities who are helping to feed people in need Right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health - we are helping our colleagues and customers to lead healthier lives. The complexity of addressing human rights risks and concerns should not be underestimated. We believe that openness and responsiveness are essential in the identification and remedy of issues. We also understand we can not always address issues alone and so are committed to working in partnership with relevant stakeholders to make improvements. Governance and monitoring Our governance committees consider financial and non-financial risks to our business and the Compliance and Social Responsibility Committees in particular consider risks related to our Human Rights Policy, which are maintained on our company risk register. Key elements of our Human Rights Policy are incorporated into our Code of Business Conduct which is reviewed by our senior managers once a year. Our established 'protector line' is primarily used by colleagues and contractors to report suspected breaches of our Code of Business Conduct or internal company policies. Next year we are launching an independent 'protector line' service for use by any of our suppliers. Their employees will be able to raise confidentially concerns of wrongdoing in the provision of either goods or services for or on behalf of T esco. Issues will be recorded, investigated and where necessary action will be taken. Improvement In 2013, we commissioned  to carry out an analysis of our Human Rights Policy. Based on these findings we are revising our policy. This includes putting more emphasis on our human rights responsibilities in a revised Code of Business Conduct. Diversity We approach diversity in its broadest sense, recognising that successful world-class businesses flourish through embracing intellectual, experiential, geographical and skills diversity as well as other factors such as age, disability, gender, race and sexual orientation. The ratio of male to female colleagues, based on the number of employees at year end, is outlined below: Male Female Board of Directors 8 73% 3 27% Senior managers - Directors 667 78% 193 22% Senior managers - Directors and managers 3,994 70% 1,739 30% All employees 216,763 43% 288,781 57% Senior roles are demanding for all - regardless of gender - and we are determined to develop a culture and environment where people can advance. We introduced a 'Women in Leadership' development programme in 2011 and so far a total of 440 female colleagues have completed or are currently on the programme. Greenhouse gas emissions We have calculated our carbon footprint according to the WRI WBCSD Greenhouse Gas 'GHG' Protocol. We follow the operational control approach and use emission factors from Defra DECC's GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2013. For more information on our carbon targets and how we calculate our carbon footprint, including reporting standards, the definition of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, and ERM CVS's Independent Assurance Statement, see www. Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 19 Other statutory disclosures A key challenge for any business is to identify the principal risks it faces and to develop and monitor appropriate controls. A successful risk management process balances risks and rewards and relies on sound judgement of their likelihood and impact. The Group maintains a Key Risk Register of the principal risks faced by the Group, including the likelihood and impact of risks and the controls and procedures implemented to mitigate them. Our process for identifying and managing risks is set out in more detail on page 40 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014. The table below sets out the principal risks faced by the Group, and examples of relevant key controls and mitigating factors. The Board considers these to be the most significant risks faced by the Group. They do not comprise all the risks associated with the Group and they are not set out in any order of priority. Additional risks not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse effect on the business. As customers' disposable income remains stretched, the competitive intensity of the retail marketplace also continues to grow. It is against this backdrop that there has been a trend towards increasing net risk during the year. Whilst the economic situation in our principal market, the UK, is beginning to show some improvement, there are increased levels of economic, political and regulatory volatility in the wider global marketplace which have increased the assessed level of net risk that the business faces in these areas. The ongoing austerity programmes in Asia and Europe and the fiscal and regulatory measures that apply to the retail sector, for example the DIDA Act in South Korea, have continued to challenge the business. An increase in the rating of economic, political and regulatory risks since last year is principally driven by a revised view of the likely impact of these risks on the business, particularly in the context of the global marketplace and the financial and trading position of the Group. The ongoing delivery of our multichannel vision, combined with a growing focus on customer data, has also heightened our sensitivity to the impact of technology risks. The impact assessment of technology has therefore increased and this remains a key area of focus. Significant efforts by management to mitigate risks and strengthen controls have reduced the assessment of the likelihood of certain risks occurring. Notable examples include: product safety and ethical trading, reputation and property. Changes to the Group's property strategy in the year have also reduced the overall property net risk rating. Principal risks Key controls and mitigating factors Business strategy If our strategy follows the wrong direction or is not effectively communicated or implemented, the business may suffer The retail industry is undergoing a transformational change in this digital age. The challenge is in balancing investment and the emphasis between traditional and new Investor support may be impacted if it takes longer than expected to demonstrate that our strategy is the right one, or if we cannot make the investments required An unclear or unsuccessful strategy against the growth of budget retailers could adversely impact our market share and profitability Our ability to operate successfully in international markets may be restricted if we do not follow the right strategy in each market, which in turn could adversely impact the Group's profitability Strategic matters are regularly reviewed by the Board and Executive Committee: the Board dedicates two full days a year to testing and challenging Group strategy Our plan is clear and focused on our three priorities: a strong UK business: multichannel leadership: and disciplined international growth A disciplined approach is taken with underperforming assets and decisive action is taken on strategy as appropriate, including the recent decisions regarding operations in the US, China and India.

The key financial risks relating to the Bank include interest rate, liquidity, credit and insurance risks which are detailed in Note 22 on page 107 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Changes to financial regulations, including in relation to credit card interchange fees, could impact banking profitability A vote in favour of Scottish independence from the UK in September 2014 could impact the fiscal, monetary and regulatory environment within which the Bank, which is headquartered in Edinburgh, operates The Bank has a defined 'Risk Appetite', approved and regularly reviewed by both the Bank's Board and the T esco PLC Board, which sets out the key risks, their optimum ranges, alert limits and the controls required to manage them within their approved tolerance limits The Bank has formed good working relationships with the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority There is a comprehensive structure of governance and oversight in place, including through the Bank's Governance and Conduct Committees, to help ensure the Bank's compliance with applicable laws and regulations The Group remains politically neutral and carefully monitors developments to enable it to respond to whatever decision is reached on Scottish independence Pensions The IAS 19 deficit could increase if there is a fall in corporate bond yields which is not offset by an increase in the pension scheme's assets Other risks affecting the deficit are detailed in Note 26 on page 112 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 and include investment, inflation and life expectancy risks There are also increasing risks of legal and regulatory changes introducing more burdensome requirements We have a diversified investment strategy with internal controls and visibility through our in-house investment team at T esco Pension Investments We regularly review our pension risks and changes were introduced in 2012 to reduce the scheme' s life expectancy and inflation risks The dedicated Pensions Audit and Risk Committee continues to monitor and scrutinise the internal controls around pension and investment risks Pensions and Treasury Directors review pension risks on a monthly basis External expert advisors and Pension Fund Trustees are fully engaged to consider the funding position and fund performance as well as the impact of legislative and regulatory changes Fraud, compliance and control As the business develops new platforms and grows in size, geographical scope and complexity, the potential for fraud and dishonest activity by our suppliers, customers and employees increases Procedures and controls are set out across the business to reduce fraud and compliance risks, including our Group Accounting Policy, key financial controls, IT access controls and segregation of duties Compliance Committees monitor the implementation of, and compliance with, relevant laws, policies and procedures Training is provided to help colleagues comply with policies and procedures Clear behavioural guidance is given to employees through training on T esco Values, the Group Code of Business Conduct, the UK Bribery Act and our Whistleblowing service - Protector Line Internal Audit undertakes a risk-based programme with detailed investigations into all business areas and reports its findings to management and the Audit Committee Group Loss Prevention & Security monitors fraud, bribery and business continuity risks across the Group and reports its findings to the Audit Committee Store and distribution compliance and technical law and trading reviews are conducted regularly to reinforce compliance across the Group A comprehensive compliance programme is in place to promote, monitor and review compliance with the UK Groceries Supply Code of Practice The Information Security Committee regularly reviews IT incidents External Audit rotates its coverage of areas and assessment of controls Business continuity and crisis management A major incident, from a natural disaster to a system failure, could impact colleague safety or the Group's ability to trade Appropriate business continuity plans and crisis management plans are in place for each business area and we continue to create and test them for eventualities Disaster recovery plans are in place for key IT systems and data centres We have security systems and processes that reflect best practice to review the risks of incidents or activism across the Group, including liaison with the UK National Co-ordinator for Counterterrorism 24 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Principal risks and uncertainties continued Financial risks review The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and credit risks relating to the risk of default by parties to financial transactions. Further explanation of these risks is set out in Note 22 on page 104 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014. An overview of the management of these risks is set out below for ease of reference and to support a further understanding of the principal treasury risks described in the table above. Details of the main financial risks relating to T esco Bank and the management of those risks can be found in Note 22 on page 107 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014. Financial risks Key controls and mitigating factors Funding and liquidity risk The risk of being unable to continue to fund our operations on an ongoing basis The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, disposals of property assets, debt capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases New funding of PS1.4 billion was raised during the year, including PS0.8 billion from long term debt and PS0.6 billion from property disposals. At the year end, net debt was PS6.6 billion 2013: PS6.6 billion The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities and a strong credit rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. At the year end, the Group had a long-term credit rating of BBB negative from Fitch, Baa1 negative from Moody's and BBB stable from Standard & Poor's Interest rate risk The risk to our profit and loss account resulting from rising interest rates Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and floors may be used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt Our policy is to fix interest rates for the year on a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs of the Group excluding T esco Bank. At the year end, the percentage of interest-bearing debt at fixed rates was 84% 2013: 75%. The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate form. The average rate of interest paid on an historic cost basis this year, excluding joint ventures and associates, was 4.5% 2013: 4.8% Foreign exchange risk The risk that exchange rate volatility may have an adverse impact on our balance sheet or profit and loss account T ransactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are managed, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies and purchased currency options. At the year end, forward foreign currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to PS2,862 million were outstanding 2013: PS1,835 million as detailed in Note 21 on page 99 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014. We translate overseas profits at average foreign exchange rates We only hedge a proportion of the investment in our international subsidiaries as well as ensuring that each subsidiary is appropriately hedged in respect of its non-functional currency assets. During the year, currency movements decreased the net value, after the effects of hedging, of the Group's overseas assets by PS1,102 million last year increase of PS420 million Credit risk The risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions The Group holds positions with an approved list of counter parties of good credit quality and these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored Insurance risk The risk of being inadequately protected from liabilities arising from unforeseen events We purchased assets, earnings and combined liability protection from the open insurance market for higher value losses only The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the business with some cover being provided by our captive insurance companies, ELH Insurance Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the Republic of Ireland. ELH Insurance Limited covers Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability, while Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability only This Strategic report, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, has been approved and signed on behalf of the Board Jonathan Lloyd Company Secretary 2 May 2014 Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 25",

It also explains other aspects of the Group's results and operations, including strategy and risk management. Group underlying profit on ordinary activities before tax excluding net loss on disposal of fixed assets, integration costs and goodwill amortisation increased by 14.7% to PS1,401m. In the year, we acquired the T&S and HIT businesses. The impact was to increase underlying profit by a net PS1m. UK capital expenditure was PS1,228m, including PS558m on new stores and PS335m on extensions and refits. Total international capital expenditure was PS906m, PS527m in Asia and PS379m in Europe. In the year ahead, we forecast Group capital expenditure to be around PS2.2bn. The Group continued to generate strong operating cash flows. Net cash inflow from operating activities increased by 17% to PS2,375m 2002 - PS2,038m. Group net debt in the year increased by PS1,177m to PS4,737m 2002 - PS3,560m, including the additional debt used for the purchase of HIT PS391m and acquired T&S debt PS155m. GROUP INTEREST AND TAXATION Net interest payable was PS180m 2002 - PS153m, of which PS10m relates to the additional debt taken on for the T&S and HIT acquisitions. Tax has been charged at an effective rate of 30.5% 2002 - 30.9%. Prior to accounting for the net loss on disposal of fixed assets, integration costs and goodwill amortisation, our underlying tax rate was 29.6% 2002 - 30.4%. SHAREHOLDER RETURNS AND DIVIDENDS Underlying diluted earnings per share excluding net loss on disposal of fixed assets, integration costs and goodwill amortisation increased by 15.2% to 13.98p 2002 - 12.14p.

GROUP STRATEGY Our strategy is simple and the four key elements remain the same: strong UK core business: non-food growth: retailing services and international. This customer focused strategy has again delivered strong results by bringing value, choice and convenience to millions of customers every week. This represents an increase of 10.7% and dividend cover of 2.25 times. Total recognised gains and losses in the year were PS968m 2002 - PS842m, comprising profit for the year of PS946m and gains on foreign currency translation of PS22m. Group shareholders' funds, before minority interests, increased by PS986m. This was due to retained profits of PS503m, new shares issued less expenses of PS461m, and gains on foreign currency translation of PS22m. As a result, return on shareholders' funds was 23.3%. Total shareholder return, which is measured as the percentage change in the share price plus the dividend, has been 10.7% over the last five years, compared to the FTSE 100 average of 26.8 %. Over the last three years it has been 7.0%, compared to the FTSE 100 average of 35.1 %. In the last year, total shareholder return in Tesco was 31.9 % compared to the FTSE 100 average of 24.0 %. Of this, 4.1% came from existing stores and 3.8% from net new stores, which includes 0.7% relating to the acquisition of T&S Stores PLC. UK underlying operating profit was 6.9% higher at PS1,297m 2002 - PS1,213m with an operating margin held flat at 6.0%. com operations achieved sales of PS447m 2002 - PS356m and excluding USA and South Korea start-up losses, made a profit of PS12m 2002 - PS0.4m. As part of our store development programme we opened 62 new stores comprising six Extras, 21 Superstores, one Metro and 34 Express stores. Including extensions and refits, we opened 1.4m sq ft of new space and expect to open a further 1.4m sq ft in the coming year. During the year we purchased T&S Stores PLC, a leading convenience retailer. Total consideration was PS366m, which consisted of PS358m of issued shares and PS8m of other acquisition costs. The convenience market is a PS20bn market in the UK and this acquisition increases our share from 1% to 5%. We plan to convert 450 to the Tesco Express format over the next three to four years bringing the Tesco range and value offer to many more customers in neighbourhood locations. REST OF EUROPE In the Rest of Europe sales rose by 22.5% to PS3,032m 2002 - PS2,475m and contributed an underlying operating profit of PS141m, up from PS90m last year. Sales in the Republic of Ireland grew by 8%. We have 77 stores, giving us 1.7m sq ft, and have plans for a further six stores in 2003 04. In Central Europe we opened 18 hypermarkets in the year giving us 83 in total. This gives us total space in Central Europe of 8.9m sq ft. The acquisition of HIT, a chain of Polish hypermarkets, during the year has doubled the size of our Polish operation and are now market leader. Total consideration was cash of PS400m. ASIA In the year, our Asian businesses had sales of PS2,174m 2002 - PS1,494m, up 45.5% on the previous year and made an underlying operating profit of PS71m 2002 - PS29m. Our business in Thailand, comprising 42 hypermarkets, had strong sales growth of 21%. We currently have 4.8m sq ft of selling space in Thailand which will increase to 5.4m sq ft by the end of next year. In South Korea we opened seven hypermarkets, giving us 21 in total, with sales up 66%. In Taiwan we have a total of three hypermarkets. Expansion has been slower than planned but we are now seeing opportunities to buy sites at lower prices. In Malaysia we opened our first three stores this year. The performance of the stores is encouraging and we have a good number of planning applications in the pipeline. JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES Our total share of profit before goodwill amortisation, from joint ventures and associates was PS72m compared to PS42m last year. Our share of Tesco Personal Finance pre-tax profit, post minority interests has grown significantly to PS48m 2002 - PS20m. 99 00 01 03 02 UK SALES AREA OPENED 000 sq ft 1,433 1,296 1,296 1,298 1,298 1,216 1,216 837 837 4 TESCO PLC FINANCIAL RISKS AND TREASURY MANAGEMENT The treasury function is mandated by the Board to manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs. The Board establishes the function's policies and operating parameters and routinely reviews its activities, which are also subject to regular audit. The function does not operate as a profit centre and the undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted. The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions credit risk, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. These risks are managed as described below. The balance sheet positions at 22 February 2003 are representative of the positions throughout the year. FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, long and medium-term debt capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases. The objective is to ensure continuity of funding. The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities and a strong credit rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. The Group's long-term credit rating from Moody's was reduced from Aa3 to A1 during the year, following the increase in debt which resulted from the acquisition of HIT. An additional credit rating from Standard & Poor's of A was introduced. New funding of PS2,002m was arranged including net new committed bank facilities of PS347m and medium-term notes of PS1,385m maturing between 2008 and 2033. At the year end, net debt was PS4,737m 2002 - PS3,560m and the average debt maturity was nine years 2002 - six years. INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT The objective is to limit our exposure to increases in interest rates. Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and collars are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. The policy is to fix or cap a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs. Forward start interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements are used to manage projected debt interest costs where appropriate. At the year end PS2.6bn, 55% of net debt was in fixed rate form 2002 - PS1.7bn, 46% with a further PS135m, 3% of net debt, collared as detailed in note 20. Fixed rate debt includes PS427m of funding linked to the Retail Price Index 2002 - PS372m. This debt reduces interest risk by diversifying our funding portfolio. The balance of our debt is in floating rate form. The average rate of interest paid during the year was 5.7% 2002 - 6.3%. A 1% rise in UK interest rates would reduce profit before tax by less than 1%. Changes in interest rates in other currencies would have no significant impact on Group profits. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT Our principal objective is to reduce the risk to short-term profits of exchange rate volatility. Transactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the profit and loss account are hedged, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies. We translate overseas profits into sterling at average exchange rates which we do not seek to hedge. We hedge the balance sheet by borrowing either directly or via foreign exchange transactions in matching currencies where this is cost effective. Our objectives are to maintain a low cost of borrowing and retain some potential for currency-related appreciation while partially hedging against currency depreciation. During the year currency movements had minimal impact on profits and increased the net value of the Group's overseas assets by PS22m 2002 - PS12m increase. At the year end forward foreign currency purchases equivalent to PS240m were outstanding 2002 - PS247m. See note 20. CREDIT RISK The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions. The risk is managed by spreading financial transactions across an approved list of counterparties of high credit quality. The Group's positions with these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored. 99 00 01 03 02 NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL HYPERMARKETS 152 102 102 68 68 38 38 22 22 INTERNATIONAL UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT PSm 212 119 119 74 74 50 50 46 46 99 00 01 02 03 TESCO PERSONAL FINANCE PRE-TAX PROFIT LOSS POST MINORITY INTEREST PSm 96 40 40 6 6 8 8 00 28 28 99 01 02 03 operating and financial review continued 2005 a In the case of Mr D E Reid, 100% of the options at 70.0p may be exercised at 59.7p, as targets related to growth in earnings per share in accordance with ABI guidelines have been achieved. b Date of expiry is seven years from date exercisable, with the exception of the 98.3p and 151.7p options which expire four years from date exercisable. c Options granted in the year.

      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE": "- The company\u2019s **Return on Equity (ROE)** has improved significantly from a negative -0.62% in the previous year to a positive 9.45% in the current year, marking a strong turnaround in profitability from shareholders' perspective.  \n- This improvement is driven primarily by a **28.4% increase in Group operating profit before exceptional items**, reaching \u00a31,644 million, reflecting enhanced operational efficiency and margin expansion.  \n- **Net debt reduction of 29.6% to \u00a32.6 billion** has improved the financial leverage position, reducing interest costs and strengthening the balance sheet.  \n- The company resumed dividend payments after a three-year hiatus, signaling **increased confidence in cash flow generation and earnings stability**.  \n- Growth in core markets, especially the UK & ROI segment, with like-for-like sales growth of 2.3% and a 31.1% increase in operating profit, has been a key driver.  \n- The successful **merger with Booker Group** presents new growth opportunities and synergy realization, expected to generate \u00a3200 million in recurring annual cost savings by year three, which should further enhance profitability and ROE.  \n- The company\u2019s **operating margin improved to 3.0%**, approaching the medium-term target of 3.5%-4.0%, supporting sustainable earnings growth.  \n- Continued focus on **cost reduction (\u00a3820 million savings to date towards \u00a31.5 billion target)** and cash flow generation (\u00a32.8 billion retail operating cash flow) underpins improved returns on equity.  \n- Challenges remain from economic uncertainties and competitive pressures; however, the company\u2019s strategic initiatives and balance sheet strength position it well for ongoing ROE improvement.  \n- Over the next quarter and year, the ROE trend is likely to continue positively due to synergy benefits from Booker, margin expansion, and disciplined capital management, implying enhanced **shareholder returns and dividend growth potential**.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE Driver": "- **Assets Turnover** increased significantly from 3.63 to 4.23, indicating an improved efficiency in using assets to generate sales and reflecting stronger **asset utilization**.\n- **Profit Margin** turned positive from -0.07% to 1.72%, showing a substantial recovery from losses to profitability, which is critical for **value creation** for shareholders.\n- The combined improvement in both **asset efficiency** and **profitability** suggests a robust enhancement in the company's **Return on Equity (ROE)**.\n- The increase in **assets turnover** is supported by the reported growth in **group sales** and strong **operating profit growth** (28.4% increase before exceptional items), implying better operational management.\n- The shift from negative to positive **profit margin** aligns with the turnaround narrative, cost reduction initiatives (PS1.5bn savings target), and margin expansion efforts reaching 3.0% in H2.\n- The **merger with Booker** and strategic focus on synergies and new growth channels are likely drivers behind improved asset efficiency and profitability.\n- The company\u2019s focus on **own brand product relaunches**, **value offerings**, and **cost control** has enhanced margin and customer loyalty, contributing to sustained **profit margin improvement**.\n- While both drivers are strengthening, the **profit margin improvement** is more dominant given the prior year's loss-making position and the strong rebound in profitability.\n- For the next quarter and year, the company expects continued margin expansion toward 3.5-4.0%, supported by ongoing cost savings, integration synergies, and sales growth, pointing to sustained **profitability improvement**.\n- Asset turnover is expected to remain stable or improve moderately as the integration of Booker expands the asset base efficiently and the company continues repurposing store space and improving supply chain operations.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of Risk": "- **Gearing ratio** has improved significantly from 4.48 to 2.52, indicating a substantial reduction in financial leverage and hence lower financial risk.\n- **Current ratio** declined slightly from 0.79 to 0.71, suggesting a marginal reduction in short-term liquidity, but the ratio remains below 1, which may warrant caution.\n- **Quick ratio** also decreased from 0.37 to 0.27, reflecting a reduced ability to cover immediate liabilities without relying on inventory, indicating slightly higher liquidity risk.\n- **NLP financial risk** increased from 1.05 to 1.16, signaling a modest rise in perceived financial risk based on textual disclosures.\n- **NLP legal risk** more than doubled from 0.07 to 0.20, highlighting growing concerns or disclosures related to legal issues.\n- **NLP tax risk** slightly decreased from 0.72 to 0.69, suggesting marginally reduced tax-related uncertainties or exposures.\n- **NLP specificity** improved slightly, from 0.0970 to 0.0972, indicating marginally clearer and more focused disclosures on risk.\n- **NLP sentence length** decreased from 28.28 to 27.08 words, and **sentence depth** slightly dropped from 6.53 to 6.45, denoting simpler and more accessible language.\n- The reduced complexity in language combined with improved specificity suggests enhanced **transparency** and better **investor communication**.\n- Overall, while liquidity risk shows minor deterioration, the reduction in gearing and clearer reporting signal a generally **improving risk profile**, though the increased legal risk should be monitored closely by investors in the short to medium term.",
      "summary": "- The company\u2019s **Return on Equity (ROE)** improved markedly from **-0.62% to 9.45%**, driven by a **28.4% increase in operating profit** and enhanced **operational efficiency**.  \n- **Net debt reduction of 29.6% to \u00a32.6 billion** has strengthened the balance sheet and lowered financial leverage, reflected in the improved **gearing ratio from 4.48 to 2.52**.  \n- Resumption of **dividend payments** signals renewed confidence in **cash flow generation** and earnings stability, supported by **\u00a32.8 billion retail operating cash flow**.  \n- Growth in core markets, especially the UK & ROI, with like-for-like sales growth of **2.3%** and a **31.1% increase in operating profit**, underpins profitability gains.  \n- The merger with **Booker Group** is expected to generate **\u00a3200 million in annual cost savings** and improve both **asset turnover** (up from 3.63 to 4.23) and **profit margins** (from negative to 1.72%).  \n- Ongoing **cost reduction initiatives (\u00a3820 million savings to date)** and focus on **margin expansion to 3.0%** support sustainable earnings growth.  \n- Liquidity ratios show slight deterioration (**current ratio 0.71, quick ratio 0.27**), warranting monitoring, but overall **risk profile improves** with clearer disclosures and reduced complexity.  \n- **NLP analysis** highlights increased **legal risk**, which investors should watch, though **tax risk declined slightly** and **reporting transparency improved**.  \n- The company\u2019s strategic initiatives, including synergy realization, margin expansion, and disciplined capital management, position it well for continued ROE improvement and shareholder value creation.  \n- Overall, the financial and operational metrics indicate a strong turnaround with positive momentum in profitability, efficiency, risk management, and investor communication."

We have taken important decisions to help our customers through the year - from reformulating thousands of products to reduce salt, fat and sugar, to launching great value exclusive food brands. Thanks to these efforts, our offer is more competitive, and more customers are shopping at Tesco as a result. At the same time, we are also focused on new opportunities for growth. Most significantly, our merger with Booker allows us to become the UK's leading food business. This report sets out what we have achieved in the year, and gives an update on our medium-term ambitions - our six strategic drivers. We are making strong progress, and firmly believe that by serving shoppers a little better every day, the momentum in our business will continue. Serving shoppers a little better every day. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 2 Introduction 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. Following completion of the merger, I am delighted to welcome two new Directors to the Board: Charles Wilson and Stewart Gilliland. Charles has been appointed to the role of CEO for our retail and wholesale operations in the UK & ROI, while Stewart has joined the Board as a Non-executive Director. Both Charles and Stewart bring substantial levels of experience and expertise, and I know that our business will benefit greatly from their talents. I would also like to take the opportunity here to welcome the very many new shareholders in Tesco, who took up our shares as part of the merger. I look forward to meeting many of you over the coming months, and to hearing your views. Throughout the year, the Board has dedicated significant time to overseeing the merger process, as well as continuing its close involvement in matters of strategy. The Board has also supported the development of our corporate responsibility strategy for the Group, which culminated in the launch of the Little Helps Plan in October 2017. The plan sets out how we will make a positive contribution to our colleagues, customers and communities - as a sustainable business that also takes a lead on issues of societal importance, such as health and tackling food waste. More details on the Little Helps Plan, and the commitments we have made, can be found starting on page 16 of the Strategic report. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to every colleague at Tesco. I firmly believe that the retail industry, and Tesco in particular, have an important role in helping people to develop fulfilling and successful careers. Almost a quarter of our most senior leaders began their careers in stores and, as I travel around our business, I am constantly impressed by the calibre and experience of the colleagues I meet, from a very diverse range of backgrounds. Tesco is a powerful engine of social mobility, and creating opportunities for colleagues to get on in their careers is a focus for us at every level of our business. It is our colleagues' dedication, and relentless focus on doing the right thing for our customers, that has enabled us to build the strong platform we have today. I am confident that the Board and management team have the right plans in place to build from that platform and continue to grow. That will be our collective focus for the coming year, and beyond, as we create long-term value for every stakeholder in our business. John Allan Non-executive Chairman We have made substantial progress this year, as we position our business for new growth. The management team has built solid foundations - and operating profit before exceptional items for the Group is up 28.4% to PS1,644m 2016 17: PS1,280m, with statutory profit before tax of PS1,298m 2016 17: PS145m. This greatly improved performance has also allowed us to make a return to paying dividends, for the first time since 2014. The decision to reinstate the dividend was a particularly important one, and reflects the conviction that the Board and I have in Dave and his team, and the progress we are seeing. So it is from this strong position that we also look ahead to the new opportunities presented by our merger with Booker Group. Shortly after the end of our financial year, and following regulatory and shareholder approval, we completed that merger. Work is already well underway to unlock the substantial synergies that are now available to the combined Group. Bringing together knowledge and skills from across retail and wholesale is both allowing us to trial innovative new concepts and to move faster with existing strategies, for example in rapidly growing the fresh food offer available to Booker's customers. ' I would like to pay tribute to every colleague at Tesco. ' John Allan Non-executive Chairman A platform for growth. com ar2018 to hear more from John Allan. Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 3 Chairman's statement 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. This has been another significant year for our business. After three years of turnaround, the results we'five shared for this year show that we are firmly on track, and delivering on our commitments. I am pleased with the progress we have made, and excited by the opportunities ahead. We have seen nine consecutive quarters of sales growth in our core UK business, with Group sales up 2.3% for the year. Group operating profit before exceptional items is up 28.4% to PS1,644m 2016 17: PS1,280m, and we are generating more cash - with Retail operating cash flow up 21.7% to PS2.8bn 2016 17: PS2.3bn. We are also making good progress towards the margin ambition we set out in October 2016, with Group operating margin reaching 3.0% in the second half of the year. At the same time, we have strengthened our balance sheet, with Net debt down 29.6% to PS2.6bn 2016 17: PS3.7bn. The external environment remains challenging: consumers are feeling the impact of economic uncertainty, and the pressures I described in last year's Annual Report, such as business rates in the UK and competitive market conditions in Central Europe, have not eased. However, the journey we are on to simplify and grow our business puts us in a strong position to deal with these challenges. By keeping our focus, we are creating value for our customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders. Customers We are helping customers in the areas that matter most to them, and bringing them more sustainable, affordable, healthy food. As a result, our net promoter score has increased by 5 points as more customers recommend Tesco as a place to shop: loyalty is growing, and in the UK 260,000 more shoppers are shopping at Tesco. In the first half of the year, we took a strategic decision to protect our customers and hold back the inflationary pressure we were seeing in the rest of the UK market. We'five also looked at other ways to add value for our customers, with a series of little helps through the year, including: - covering the cost of the 'tampon tax' on women's sanitary products in the UK: - removing barriers to eating healthily with our 'little helps to healthier living' campaign in the UK, and taking 4,100 tonnes of sugar out of our Own Brand soft drinks in Central Europe: - launching our Clubcard app in Thailand, making it easier for customers to manage their points: - passing on an interest rate increase to savers at Tesco Bank, following the Bank of England's base rate rise in November: and - running regular 'Weekly Little Helps' in the UK, helping customers save money on everything from fresh food to fuel. As a business with food at our heart, improving our Own Brand food ranges is a particularly important part of our plans. This year we have relaunched many of these ranges - bringing our customers the best quality products at the very best prices. We have looked at each of the three tiers of our Own Brand offer - 'good', 'better' and 'best' - and are strengthening some brands, like our Tesco core range, and redesigning others, like Tesco finest. Where our customers want the best value, without any compromise on quality, we are adding to our range of entry-level brands that are exclusively available at Tesco. New brands we have launched for Tesco customers include prepared meals, pasta and sauces from the Hearty Food Co. and bakery products from H. W. Nevill's. As part of this work, we have already relaunched 1,300 products in the year, with thousands more to follow - and our brand perception measures of quality and value have both increased. Colleagues The improvements we are making to our business are driven by our colleagues, as they serve our shoppers a little better every day. This year, we announced a 10.5% increase in hourly pay for our UK store colleagues over the next two years, and our Colleague Bonus Plan continues to reward colleagues in the UK for their contribution to our turnaround. ' I'm pleased with the progress we have made, and excited by the opportunities ahead. ' Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive Delivering on our commitments. com ar2018 to hear more from Dave Lewis. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 4 Group Chief Executive's statement 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. indb 4 20 04 2018 15:42 Some of the changes we have made to simplify our business have had a significant impact on colleagues, including the closure of our Customer Engagement Centre in Cardiff, and changes to our operational structures in stores, and I am grateful for the professionalism and integrity of our colleagues at these difficult times. Over the summer, we also began to move to a new service model in our offices in the UK, followed by similar changes in Central Europe, in order to simplify the way we organise ourselves, reduce duplication and cost, and invest in serving shoppers better. In a simpler business, it's particularly important that we still do everything we can to help colleagues develop their careers as they wish, and this year we have continued our apprenticeship programme in the UK, as well as running a Career Academy in our Thai business, for around 150 students. We're also committed to building a team which is diverse, and reflects the communities we serve. We continue to develop an inclusive culture at every level of our organisation, helping our colleagues with the flexibility, skills and reward they need to get on. Suppliers With our suppliers, we are building even closer partnerships, working together to deliver great quality products for our customers and grow our mutual businesses. Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 5 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. indb 5 20 04 2018 15:42 In our most recent anonymous Supplier Viewpoint survey, 83% of our UK & ROI suppliers say they are treated fairly, and 94% say we pay promptly - and for the second year running, we topped the independently-run supplier Advantage Survey. By growing our business with our closest product partners, we have been able to launch new and exclusive products for our customers, and support our suppliers to invest in innovation. This year we have worked with our partners to launch new products including our Wicked Kitchen vegan range in the UK, Eat Fresh produce brand in Malaysia, and an extended Free From range in Central Europe. One example of particularly close partnership is our Tesco Sustainable Dairy Group, which has now paid an extra PS300m to farmers above the market price of milk since it launched - helping them to manage the volatility in milk price experienced by the dairy industry. The group also incentivises our farmers to focus on quality, sustainability and productivity - and following this success, we have set up similar groups for other agricultural products including potatoes, lamb, poultry and eggs. I'm also pleased that 25 of our largest food suppliers have agreed to join us in tackling food waste, by committing to targets on waste, publishing their data, and acting to stop good food going to waste. Shareholders With our business growing again, we resumed the payment of dividends to our shareholders this year - after a three-year absence while we stabilised our business. We remain firmly on track to deliver the mediumterm ambitions we set out in October 2016: to reduce our costs by PS1.5bn, generate PS9bn of retail cash from operations and improve operating margins to between 3.5% and 4.0% by 2019 20. By maintaining a disciplined approach to capital, and further reducing our debt - already down from PS 8.5 bn in 2014 15 to PS 2.6 bn today - we can continue to strengthen our balance sheet and return to investment grade credit metrics. Our underlying philosophy for creating sustainable value for shareholders places increasing focus on cash profitability, free cash flow and earnings growth. An important driver of this growth will come from the benefits of our merger with Booker, which we completed on 5 March 2018. The combined business allows us to access new growth areas, and provide food wherever it is prepared or eaten - 'in home' or 'out of home'. As a result of the merger, I am also delighted to welcome Charles Wilson to the Executive team and Board as our UK & ROI CEO, responsible for both retail and wholesale. A sustainable business It is critically important that as our business delivers growth, we do so in a way which is sustainable. In October 2017, we published our Little Helps Plan, which sets out how we will: - create a business where colleagues can get on, whatever their background: - help our customers make healthier choices and enjoy good quality, sustainable products, at affordable prices: and - help make sure no food that could be eaten is wasted, anywhere in our supply chain. More detail on our performance, including statutory results, can be found in our Financial review on page 12.

I'm particularly proud of our efforts to stop good food going to waste - in the UK we have donated 19 million meals from surplus this year to help feed people in need, with a further 2 million and 25 million meals from our businesses in the Republic of Ireland and Central Europe respectively. Looking ahead With our business focused on growth, we will continue to deliver on the same plans for Tesco - our six strategic drivers - that have served us well in our turnaround so far. At the same time, we will begin to deliver the substantial synergies that our merger with Booker unlocks: bringing benefits to consumers and colleagues, creating a wider market opportunity for our suppliers and new career opportunities for our colleagues - as well as accelerating the growth of our combined business for shareholders. In what has been a very significant year, I am grateful to every colleague in our business for everything they have done to keep serving shoppers better. It is their dedication and talent which drives all of our plans, and I look forward to continuing our work together as we grow the UK's leading food business. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive For example, our trial of a new Chef Central format is well underway, with a first store in Bar Hill, Cambridge selling products in bulk to professional caterers and the public alongside our existing Tesco Extra store. And, where it's right for our customers, we are offering catering-format products in a number of Tesco stores too. These are just the early stages of the many exciting opportunities in front of us. As we look ahead, our combination of businesses uniquely positions us to better serve the large and growing food market in the UK. The combined Tesco and Booker business allows us to bring together the retail and wholesale expertise of our two businesses, and access new opportunities for growth. Together we employ over 310,000 colleagues in the UK, serve 117,000 independent retailers, 441,000 catering businesses, 641,000 small businesses, and work with over 7,000 suppliers. Through our merger, we will bring benefits to customers, suppliers, colleagues and shareholders: - We will delight consumers with better availability of quality food at attractive prices across retail and eating out locations, and serve better the faster growing 'out of home' food market. - We will help independent retailers, caterers and small businesses by further improving choice, price and service, with enhanced digital and delivery service options. - And for our suppliers, we will create a broader market opportunity, with strong growth prospects and a clear opportunity to develop better own brand and fresh ranges. As our two businesses join forces, we are already beginning to deliver benefits. Importantly, there is no lengthy integration process, as we want to keep the complementary skills of retail and wholesale in our business, and start accessing growth opportunities as quickly as possible. Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 7 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. A differentiated brand A strong and differentiated brand creates long-term value for every stakeholder in our business. Our purpose, to serve shoppers a little better every day, is at the heart of what our brand stands for. Over the last year, we have continued to build trust, and have seen a 5 point improvement in customer recommendations of our brand. We continue to focus on products and services which make the Tesco offer unique, and this year we have relaunched our core and finest food ranges, as well as introducing new brands which are exclusive to Tesco, such as our Hearty Food Co. ready meals, and our Fox & Ivy homeware. Food quality is a particularly powerful driver of supermarket choice, so strengthening customer perceptions of our food is a priority. Our Food Love Stories campaign has continued this year, celebrating the food our customers love to make, for the people they love - and helping increase customer perceptions of quality at Tesco, up 2.7 points year-on-year. But the way customers feel about our brand is defined by more than just our products: it's also about how we respond to the issues that matter to them, from healthy eating to reducing plastic packaging - and the value that Tesco creates for society. In May 2017, we held our first ever health month for colleagues and customers, including helpful 'little swaps' with products that are lower in saturated fat, salt and sugar, and recorded our highest ever score for customers saying that Tesco helps them lead healthier lives. Reduce operating costs by PS1.5bn We continue to simplify our business and reduce costs, with in-year savings of PS594m - and PS820m of savings to date towards our PS1.5bn ambition. We have reviewed every aspect of our operation to identify opportunities for savings - with a particular focus on our store operating model, where we have delivered PS541m of savings: logistics and distribution, with PS104m of savings: and goods not for resale, where we have made savings of PS174m. We continue to encourage a cost-conscious culture, finding savings so that we can reinvest for the benefit of customers. We have also simplified the shopping experience for customers, at the same time as reducing costs, for example by increasing availability of our Scan As You Shop self-scan handsets - now in over 500 UK stores and beginning to roll out in Central Europe - and making till receipts optional in our smaller stores, which has generated savings of around PS3m. We have also made strong progress in reducing the costs of procuring goods and services not for resale, finding synergies across the Group. In particular, we have improved our services in facilities management, freight and media services, while also delivering savings of PS50m. Generate PS9bn cash from operations Our focus on free cash generation continues, and Retail cash generated from operations increased by PS495m to PS2,773m this year, driven by improved profitability and strong working capital management. One example of our work is in reducing stockholding, by improving the way we receive deliveries from our suppliers. To minimise our environmental impact, and reduce transport costs, we order full trucks of products from suppliers whenever we can - which sometimes means 'rounding up' an order. However, by analysing our orders forensically, we have been able to sort stock between trucks and identify where we can eliminate a truck. This removes unnecessary journeys for our suppliers, and allows us to take out unnecessary 'rounded' stock. Because we are ordering only what's needed to ensure great availability, our customers can buy what they want, and we can order less. Our six strategic drivers will create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. An update on our six strategic drivers. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 8 The six strategic drivers 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. Maximise the mix to achieve a 3.5% - 4.0% margin To achieve our 3.5% - 4.0% margin ambition by our 2019 20 financial year, we continue to build sustainable profitability across our businesses, channels and product ranges. By carefully managing the combination of volume, mix and cost-effectiveness in our business, Group operating margin for this year was 2.9% - up 57 basis points. In Asia, our margin has grown to 6.0%, as we have stepped back from unprofitable bulk selling in Thailand. This was a deliberate decision that we took at the start of the year, allowing us to focus on serving our core retail customers better, and increase profitability. In our online business, we are improving the economics of our offer, while giving customers greater choice and flexibility. For example, we have extended our delivery saver subscription service, to introduce new monthly plans - offering a great value option to our most loyal customers. We have also extended our Click & Collect options - including same-day collection - with slots at a range of prices so that customers can choose the service most convenient to them. Maximise value from property Our property portfolio across the Group is significant, and we are looking at opportunities to better use our space for the benefit of customers, while also releasing value where it's the right thing to do for our business. Over the last three years, we have released a cumulative PS1.4bn of value from property proceeds, at the same time as increasing our proportion of freehold property in the UK & ROI from 41% to 52%. In the UK, we are exploring a small number of opportunities to work with a third-party to re-develop our store sites in high-value locations. Our Hackney store in London is one such example, where we have sold the site for a mixed-use development - allowing us to release value, while still retaining a store on the new site and with continuity of trade throughout. We can also create value for our customers by using space in new ways, as we repurpose space in our larger stores - and this year, we have repurposed 1.1m sq. In Central Europe, we have worked with partners to bring a new offer to customers in a number of our stores - and this year, across the region, we opened ten shop units with H&M, and three with Decathlon. Innovation To serve our shoppers a little better every day, it's important we listen and respond to their needs, with innovation across every aspect of our offer, and a strong pipeline of ideas to come to market. We have innovated in our product ranges - for example, with the launch of our exclusive Wicked Kitchen range of plant-based dishes, including new ingredients and exotic preparations such as carrot 'pastrami' and eryngii mushroom 'bolognese'. The range responds to increasing demand for vegetarian and vegan food, and since its January launch has proved extremely popular with customers. As customers look for increasingly convenient options to do their shopping, this year we became the first retailer in the UK to offer same-day grocery deliveries nationwide, and in London - through our Tesco Now app - we can deliver within an hour. And at Tesco Bank, our award-winning Tesco Pay digital wallet continues to prove popular with customers, with over 450,000 downloads of the app. 9 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic report 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. Customers Tesco exists to serve customers - listening to them and acting on what is most important, however they choose to shop with us. Product We build close and mutually-beneficial relationships with our supplier partners, to source the best possible products that meet and anticipate customers' needs. Reinvest Our focus is always on making Tesco the best it can be for our customers. The better a job we do for customers, the more we will improve sales: the more our sales improve, the more we can reinvest in further improving the shopping trip. Channels To bring the best products to customers we work through a range of channels - from small shops to large shops, and our online business. Booker gives us access to new channels, including Business Centres and delivered wholesale. Our business is organised around the three pillars of Customers, Product and Channels, and we measure our progress with six simple key performance indicators.

A detailed analysis of discontinued operations can be found in Note 7. This was another strong performance for Tesco with results ahead of expectations. We grew sales by 0.6%, excluding VAT, excluding fuel, at constant exchange rates and experienced like-for-like sales growth of 0.7%. Group operating profit before exceptional items was PS1,644m, up 28.4% on last year as we significantly strengthened our profitability, remaining firmly on track to deliver our medium-term ambitions. Our statutory profit before tax increased to PS1,298m including PS155m of exceptional items. We generated retail operating cash flow of PS2.8bn, up 21.7% on last year, driven by the strong improvement in our operating profit. We reduced net debt excluding Tesco Bank by 29.6% to PS 2.6 bn. We are well placed to deliver our ambition of a Group operating margin of 3.5%-4.0% by the 2019 20 financial year. This ambition is underpinned by six strategic drivers, including the PS1.5bn operating cost reductions which we are on track to secure, having delivered cumulative savings of PS820m to date. Reflecting our improved performance and confidence in future prospects, the Board has proposed the payment of a 2.0 pence per share final dividend following on from the interim dividend of 1.0 pence per share. We expect dividends to grow towards a target cover of around two times earnings per share over the medium term.

In the UK, like-for-like sales growth of 2.2% includes our ninth consecutive quarter of positive performance, despite an ongoing drag of 0.4 % from general merchandise as we take action to fide-emphasise certain categories. We delivered a consistently strong performance in fresh food, outperforming the market in volume terms. During the fourth quarter we experienced some distribution-related disruption, following the administration of Palmer & Harvey, resulting in lost tobacco sales across December. Despite these challenges, which are now behind us, we continued to deliver positive sales momentum through the fourth quarter. Market conditions have remained challenging with continued cost price inflation. We have worked hard with our supplier partners throughout the year to mitigate price increases wherever possible, and made a significant investment in the first half to further hold back inflation and protect customers. We have continued to reduce promotional participation over the year, focusing instead on consistently offering the best value for customers on all of our products. Our own brand ranges have performed very well, with like-for-like sales growing 4.2% year-on-year. We have embarked on a re-launch of over 10,000 own brand products, across our entry, core and finest ranges, with the initial focus on ready meals and Italian products. Our new, exclusive Hearty Food Co. range of ready meals and improved core Tesco products have proved particularly popular, contributing to an increase in overall own brand participation of nearly one percent. We have continued to refine our general merchandise range, reducing SKUs by 16%, as we focus on categories with more sustainable profitability. We have delivered 2.7% sales growth in our home category, following the launch of our new own brand Go Cook and Fox & Ivy ranges. These new brands have driven a 14% and 20% increase in customers to our cook and homeware ranges, respectively. Clothing performed well during the year with like-for-like sales growth of 2.6%, reflecting the strength of the F&F brand and quality of our range. All store formats and channels have achieved like-for-like growth, with our large store business growing at 1.9% and our online grocery sales growing 5.1% with both higher order numbers and increased average basket size. In ROI, like-for-like sales grew by 2.7%, improving steadily throughout the year as customers responded well to an even more competitive price position. The main driver of growth was a 4.2% increase in volume, ahead of market volume growth. Fresh food volumes were particularly strong, growing by 5.2% year-on-year.

Our efforts to reduce operating costs and improve efficiencies across our store estate and head office have delivered a significant increase in profitability, particularly during the second half when our operating margin reached 2.5%, up 67 basis points year-on-year. Further progress on maximising the mix within our business and driving volume more selectively, particularly in general merchandise, has aided margin expansion.

Our focus on improving the quality and breadth of the range in our stores has delivered positive results with fresh food sales growth of 1.2%. However, this growth was held back by declines in general merchandise and clothing. Our convenience formats delivered positive like-for-like growth across all countries. We have continued to exit from unprofitable stores in the region, with 28 store closures contributing to an overall sales reduction of 1.6 % at constant exchange rates. Legislative changes in the region are affecting our business, with Poland phasing in a gradual ban on Sunday trading from March 2018, which takes complete effect by 2020. Central Europe operating profit before exceptional items was PS119m, up PS61m year-on-year at actual exchange rates. We have made continued progress towards operating the four markets we serve as one combined region, helping to improve our customer offer. In the first half of the year we opened a new distribution centre in Galanta, Slovakia serving all four countries and benefiting from the best local practices in the region. The resulting benefits of more effective stock management combined with our other efforts on cost savings have more than offset the impact of inflation on the cost base and enabled us to improve profitability.

Adjusting for this impact, underlying like-for-like sales in the region were down 1.0 %, largely reflecting the deflationary effect of lowering our fresh food prices for customers. Asia operating profit before exceptional items was PS299m, up 7.6% at constant exchange rates and up 14.1% at actual exchange rates. This improvement has been driven by refocusing on our core retail offer and continuing to reduce our cost base as part of the Group's overall cost savings programme.

Throughout the year, the Bank has continued to strengthen its product and service offering to customers, delivering growth of 4.1% in active customer account numbers across its primary products. During the year, we completed the roll-out of Tesco Pay, the Group's digital wallet offering, to every one of our stores in the UK. In July 2017, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of the launch of our mortgage product, which has now reached PS3.0bn in balances. Operating profit before exceptional items increased by 10.2% year-on-year to PS173m. Lending growth in the year has been strong, driven by secured mortgage lending which now comprises 26% of the lending portfolio, versus 22% last year. In addition, Money Services products such as our Travel Money offer have performed well overall as the Group continues to enhance the product range and expand the customer base. Exceptional items of PS 24 m relating to Tesco Bank include an increase in the provision for customer redress and a credit received following the conclusion of negotiations with a third party in respect of previously recognised customer redress.

In the current year, the net effect of exceptional items on operating profit is PS193m. Net restructuring and redundancy charges of PS 102 m relate principally to structural changes to our business to simplify our operating model within stores and head office. The net impairment reversal of non-current assets and onerous lease provisions of PS53m includes a net reversal of PS185m in property, plant and equipment and investment property, a net PS 24 m charge in software and other intangible assets and a net charge of PS 108 m of onerous lease provisions. Provision for customer redress of PS 24 m relating to Tesco Bank, includes an increase of PS 35 m in the provision for Payment Protection Insurance PPI, partially offset by a PS1m Consumer Credit Act CCA provision release and a credit of PS10m received following the conclusion of negotiations with a third party in respect of previously recognised customer redress. The investment disposal profit of PS124m reflects the sale of our remaining minority stake in the Lazada e-commerce platform, completed during the first half. The sale of our opticians business in the UK & ROI to Vision Express resulted in a PS38m gain on disposal. 13 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic report 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. indb 13 20 04 2018 15:42 Two property-related transactions completed in the UK in the first half of the year account for the majority of the PS79m property transactions within exceptional items. In the prior year, we took an exceptional charge of PS 235 m in respect of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement DPA between Tesco Stores Limited and the UK Serious Fraud Office SFO regarding historic accounting practices and an agreement with the UK Financial Conduct Authority FCA of a finding of market abuse in relation to the Tesco PLC trading statement announced on 29 August 2014. Included in this charge was PS 85 m for the Shareholder Compensation Scheme. With the Compensation Scheme now being closed to new claimants, we have released PS25m of the amounts provided. Outstanding claims submitted before the 22 February 2018 deadline are still being processed. Joint ventures and associates, interest and tax Joint ventures and associates Our share of post-tax losses from joint ventures and associates before exceptional items was PS 6 m, an improvement of PS24m year-on-year due to reduced losses recognised in Gain Land, our joint venture in China. There were no exceptional items this year relating to our share of post-tax losses from joint ventures and associates. Finance income and costs 2017 18 2016 17 Interest payable on medium term notes, loans and bonds PS 363 m PS 434 m Interest receivable on associated derivatives PS31m PS6m Net interest on medium term notes, loans and bonds PS 332 m PS 428 m Other interest receivable and similar income PS44m PS42m Other finance charges and interest payable PS 70 m PS 89 m Capitalised interest PS2m PS6m Net finance cost before exceptional charges, IAS 19 net pension finance costs and IAS 39 fair value remeasurements PS 356 m PS 469 m IAS 39 fair value remeasurements PS23m PS61m IAS 19 net pension finance costs PS 162 m PS 113 m Exceptional charge - translation of Korea proceeds PS 38 m PS 244 m Net finance costs PS 533 m PS 765 m Net finance costs before exceptional charges, IAS 19 net pension finance costs and IAS 39 fair value remeasurements reduced by PS113m year-on-year to PS 356 m. This 24.1% decline year-on-year was mainly driven by a net PS96m reduction in interest on interest-bearing liabilities. Debt maturities totalled PS1.4bn during the year and we also undertook PS1.3bn of bond tenders in two separate liability management exercises. These bond tenders during the year contributed to PS23m lower interest costs and we expect an associated reduction in interest payable of c. PS50m on an annualised basis. In cash interest terms, we were helped by a favourable timing benefit of PS55m on our largest sterling-denominated bond, for which no annual coupon payment was made during the year owing to the timing of our year-end date. Net finance costs, which include non-cash items, were around 30% lower year-on-year. Fair value remeasurements are largely driven by changes in the market assessment of credit risk and various market indices which can fluctuate significantly. Net pension finance costs increased by PS 49 m year-on-year driven by a higher opening pension deficit part offset by a lower opening discount rate. Net pension finance costs are calculated by multiplying the opening deficit by the opening discount rate each year. For 2018 19, they are expected to decrease to c. PS 95 m as the impact of a higher opening discount rate is more than offset by the year-on-year reduction in deficit. The exceptional charge of PS 38 m relating to the translation of the remaining proceeds from the sale of our business in Korea will not arise again since the funds have now been moved to a Sterling denominated entity within the Group. The proceeds had been held in GBP money market funds in a non-Sterling denominated subsidiary and the translation effect represents no economic cost to the Group. Group tax Tax on profit before exceptional items was PS 286 m, with an effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items for the Group of 25.0%. As previously indicated, this tax rate is higher than the UK statutory rate primarily due to the depreciation of assets that do not qualify for tax relief and the impact of the 8% supplementary tax surcharge on bank profits. We expect the impact of these items on the effective tax rate to reduce as our overall level of profitability continues to increase, and therefore we expect the effective tax rate to reduce to around 20% in the medium term. The effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items for the 2018 19 financial year is expected to be around 24%. Earnings per share on a continuing operations basis Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items were 11.88p, nearly 63% higher year-on-year principally due to our stronger profit performance. Statutory basic earnings per share from continuing operations were 12.12p, up from 0.81p last year. Summary of total indebtedness 2017 18 2016 17 Movement Net debt excludes Tesco Bank PS 2,625 m PS 3,729 m PS1,104m Discounted operating lease commitments PS 6,931 m PS 7,440 m PS509m Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax PS 2,728 m PS 5,504 m PS2,776m Total indebtedness PS 12,284 m PS 16,673 m PS4,389m Retail net debt reduced by PS1.1bn to PS 2.6 bn as retail operating cash flow and disposal proceeds were greater than capital expenditure and other charges. Within net debt, we used surplus cash to prepay PS1.3bn of the Group's long-dated bonds as part of an ongoing focus to strengthen the balance sheet. We have a strong funding and liquidity profile underpinned by PS4.2bn committed facilities and our key credit metrics, fixed charge cover and total indebtedness EBITDAR, have improved to 2.7 times and 3.3 times respectively. Discounted operating lease commitments have reduced by PS509m, including the benefit from the buyback of 17 stores in the UK during the year. We anticipate rental savings of PS26m on an annualised basis as a result of these property purchases. On an IAS 19 basis, the pension deficit measure net of deferred tax has reduced from PS5.5bn last year to PS2.7bn at the end of the current year. The movement during the year was partly driven by an increase in yields on corporate bonds, which drive the discount rate used for accounting purposes and our decision at the half-year stage to update the discount rate model in line with developing market practice and following actuarial advice. In the Group's view, it now more appropriately reflects expected yields on corporate bonds over the life of the scheme's liabilities. At the same time, the application of latest industry life expectancy tables and favourable actual scheme experience have also contributed to the reduction. During the year, the triennial pension review was concluded, with the business and the Trustees agreeing that annual contributions will increase by PS15m to PS285m per annum from April 2018, with our framework for the long-term funding of the scheme unchanged. As at 31 March 2017, the actuarial deficit was PS3.0bn, an increase of c. PS0.25bn since the last triennial valuation. Overall, total indebtedness has reduced by PS4.4bn in the year. Net debt has reduced by almost PS6bn over the last three years. Summary retail cash flow Retail operating cash flow increased by PS495m to PS2,773m in the year. This increase of 21.7% year-on-year, was mainly driven by improved Group profitability. Further improvements in working capital of PS499m also contributed to the improvement in cash flow, although this includes PS102m of timing benefits principally as a consequence of the failure of a supplier towards the end of the year. Exceptional cash items increased year-on-year, largely driven by a cash outflow of PS149m relating to payment of the SFO fine and initial Shareholder Compensation Scheme payments. We expect a further cash outflow of c. PS60m relating to such claims. Other cash exceptional items totalling PS169m include a PS160m VAT refund from HMRC regarding the treatment of VAT on Clubcard rewards, which HMRC have appealed. This has no net effect in the Group income statement. Cash capital expenditure of PS 1.2 bn was up year-on-year due to the timing of payments relating to commitments made towards the end of the last financial year. Combined net cash interest and tax of PS 428 m was PS113m lower than last year largely as a result of debt maturities and bond tenders. We generated PS253m of proceeds from property sales and completed the buyback of 17 stores during the year, for a cash consideration of PS393m.

Finally, cash inflows of PS362m relating to disposals and dividends received includes consideration of PS196m from the sale of our remaining minority stake in the Lazada online business, a dividend of PS50m from Tesco Bank, and proceeds of PS45m relating to the disposal of our opticians business in the UK to Vision Express, in addition to a number of smaller transactions. Retail free cash flow of PS1,377m is up 7.0% year-on-year. This is lower than the rate of growth in retail operating cash flow principally due to timing of cash capital expenditure and lower property proceeds. Capital expenditure 2017 18 2016 17 UK & ROI PS676m PS731m Central Europe PS133m PS141m Asia PS239m PS261m Tesco Bank PS50m PS46m Group PS1,098m PS1,179m On an accrued basis, capital expenditure excluding buybacks of PS1.1bn was PS0.1bn lower than last year reflecting our disciplined approach to capital spending and focus on delivering attractive returns. Our capital expenditure in the UK focused on maintaining and replacing essential assets, alongside programmes to refresh and repurpose the estate, enhancing our store operations. New store capex has mainly been allocated to our new store opening programme in Thailand, with a limited number of Express store openings and a net gain of one new superstore in the UK. Our capital expenditure in Central Europe relates mainly to repurposing of existing stores. We expect capital expenditure to remain within a range of PS1.1bn-PS1.4bn. There was a net reduction of 1.2 m square feet, including 1.1 m square feet of space repurposed to a range of complementary partners such as Arcadia Group and H&M. Across the Group, our repurposing programme has focused on improving the ease and relevance of our large-store shopping trip for customers. In the UK & ROI, we have repurposed 75,000 square feet across 20 stores. Within the year, we opened over 50 concessions within our stores including Arcadia Group, Holland & Barrett, Dixons Carphone and Next. A brand new Booker 'Chef Central' concept store was also opened within the Tesco Extra store at Bar Hill, Cambridge in February 2018. The store primarily serves professional caterers but is open to all customers. In Central Europe, we have primarily been partnering with other clothing brands in repurposed store space including H&M and Decathlon. In Asia, we have worked with a range of different partners across a variety of brands including MR. DIY and Major Cineplex. Property The estimated market value of our fully owned property has increased by PS0.8bn to PS20.7bn, with a surplus of PS2.5bn over the net book value NBV. Our Group freehold property ownership percentage, by value, has increased to 58% from 57% last year, driven by the UK & ROI. We regained ownership of 17 stores in the UK during the year, increasing our proportion of freehold ownership by value in the UK & ROI to 52%. This repurchase of stores will result in an annualised rental saving of PS26m. We continue to seek opportunities to further reduce our exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift rent inflation where the economics are attractive. Dividend We propose to pay a final dividend of 2.0 pence per ordinary share. The proposed final dividend was approved by the Board of Directors on 10 April 2018 and is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 15 June 2018. This takes the total dividend for the year to 3.0 pence per ordinary share following the payment of an interim dividend of 1.0 pence per ordinary share in November 2017. We anticipate a split of broadly one-third to two-thirds between next year's interim and final dividends and intend to reach our targeted cover of around two times earnings in the medium term. Merger with Booker Group We completed our merger with Booker Group on 5 March 2018, after the end of the Tesco financial year. Our ' Joining Forces' integration programme is well underway and we are focused on delivering the PS200m recurring run-rate synergies identified during the merger process by the end of the third year post-completion. Booker Q4 results show a continued strong performance, with customer satisfaction up 0.3% to 85.7% and like-for-like sales up 9.9%. While Booker's full year results are still subject to audit approval, operating profit before exceptional items for the financial year to 30 March 2018 is c. PS195m and net cash is c. PS120m. Transaction costs of PS 26 m relating to our merger with Booker were included in Tesco's UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items in the 2016 17 financial year. Further costs and fees of PS 21 m arising in the 2017 18 financial year have been treated in a consistent fashion. A similar amount, consisting of stamp duty costs directly arising from the completion of the merger, will be charged to underlying profit in the 2018 19 financial year. As outlined in our merger prospectus, we anticipate up to PS 145 m of integration costs over three years, which will be treated as exceptional. Looking ahead We remain firmly on track to deliver the medium-term ambitions we set out in October 2016: to reduce our costs by PS1.5bn, to generate PS9bn of retail cash from operations and to improve operating margins to between 3.5% and 4.0% by 2019 20. In addition, by further reducing debt and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital we can continue to strengthen the balance sheet and generate an increasing level of free cash flow. Our intention remains to return to an investment grade credit rating, with our key metrics being fixed charge cover and total indebtedness EBITDAR. The integration of Booker is well underway and we are focused on delivering the identified synergies to create value for all stakeholders. We anticipate a synergy benefit of c. PS60m in the first year, growing to a cumulative c. PS140m in the second year and reaching a recurring run-rate of c. PS200m per year by the end of the third year. As we look to capitalise on the enhanced opportunities for growth available to the combined Group, we will place increasing focus on growth in earnings and free cash flow generation, in order to deliver strong, sustainable returns for shareholders.

The Little Helps Plan outlines how Tesco works in partnership with others, including suppliers, NGOs, governments and other retailers, to make a positive contribution and work towards shared global ambitions. The plan builds on the progress we have made so far and covers three areas core to the long-term success of our business: people, products and places. In October 2017, we shared targets and actions under each of these three pillars. More information on these can be found at www. The Little Helps Plan covers our retail businesses in the UK, Republic of Ireland, Central Europe and Asia. However, with the majority of our customers being in the UK, implementation of the plan and reporting will begin with the UK business. We have committed to sharing our progress along the way and will next update in October 2018. Accountability for the Little Helps Plan is led at an Executive level by Jane Lawrie, Group Communications Director, and at the Board level by Dave Lewis, Group Chief Executive. Our Corporate Responsibility Committee, chaired by Lindsey Pownall, Non-executive Director, governs the plan. More information on the activities of the Corporate Responsibility Committee can be found in the Corporate governance report on page 39. Our approach 'Every little help makes a big difference' is our third value and emphasises our belief that small actions can add up to make a big difference. Our Little Helps Plan identifies the most pressing social and environmental challenges facing the business, our customers and our communities, and outlines our commitments to help tackle these. People The 440,000 colleagues who work for us around the world are at the forefront of serving our shoppers better every day. We want to give them a great experience of working at Tesco and be a place where everyone can get on, whatever their ambitions. To do this, we are investing in training so colleagues are supported to develop their careers and to build skills for their future. We are committed to building an inclusive culture and ensuring these opportunities are available to all colleagues. We are also trialling a number of innovative solutions that will offer colleagues greater flexibility over their own work schedules. Our target To help our colleagues succeed by providing them with the flexibility, skills and reward they need to get on. For the full list of our targets and actions see our Little Helps Plan at www.

Building strong, trusted relationships with our suppliers plays a key role in achieving this. Health Our customers and colleagues tell us that they want to make healthier choices, but sometimes it can be difficult. We want to make it easier to lead a healthier life and we are focused on offering simple, practical actions that lead to sustainable changes. Packaging We know packaging plays an important role in preserving and protecting products but we are taking action to reduce its overall impact on the environment. We are working with the industry to develop a closed loop system which can be applied to all key packaging materials. Food waste We have a responsibility and commitment to lead reduction of food waste from farm to fork. Through our Group Chief Executive's Chairmanship of the international Champions 12.3 coalition, we are committed to accelerating progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal target to halve per capita global food waste by 2030. Our targets To help make sustainable products accessible and affordable for all. To support all of our colleagues to live healthier lives and help our customers make healthier food choices every time they shop with us. To ensure we never use more packaging than is needed, and that what we do use is from sustainable sources and goes on to be reused or recycled. To help halve global food waste, farm to fork, by 2030. Places We are proud to be a valued part of over 6,000 communities around the world and want to help them thrive. We bring social and economic benefits through the local people we employ, the local businesses we work with and the local projects we support. We support causes important to colleagues and customers. We deliver this through our community donation programmes, strategic partnerships with charities and support for food banks. Our target To help our local communities thrive by positively contributing both socially and economically. Foundations Underpinning all the pillars of the Little Helps Plan are a number of areas where it is vital to do the right thing. It remains a priority for us to ensure our products are safe, that we have a strong health and safety culture for customers and colleagues, and that we stay on track with our ambitious plan to become a zero-carbon business. We recognise that these areas and strong corporate governance are equally important to ensuring our business is having a positive impact on society. They are core expectations and are embedded in the way we do business. 17 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic report 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR. indb 17 20 04 2018 15:43 shopping baskets outside of seasonal changes. For colleagues we have given out free fruit and offered mini health checks throughout our health events. In 2017 18 we also made mental wellbeing training available for all colleagues and brought together a group of colleague Health Heroes to share their stories and inspire others to make healthier choices. In January 2018, we announced a groundbreaking new five-year strategic partnership with the British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK and Diabetes UK. The aim of the partnership is to help reduce the risk of heart and circulatory disease, cancer and diabetes. The partnership will support colleagues, customers and their families to make sustainable lifestyle changes and adopt healthier habits. For more information visit www. Packaging We continue to make changes to our packaging to help reduce our impact on the environment. 87% of our Own Brand packaging by weight is currently widely recyclable. We have made significant changes to the packaging of our wet wipes, resulting in a 20% reduction in the material used and thereby removing 57 tonnes of plastic. This material saving is enough to make over 10 million more packs. We recognise that we can do more in partnership with government and industry to help establish a robust, closed loop approach to recover and reuse all key packaging materials. We have three strategic priorities to help reduce packaging waste and boost recycling across the UK: 1. Materials and design: In collaboration with our suppliers we are reducing packaging and restricting the number of materials we accept so that less packaging is used and packaging is easier to recycle. Recovery and recycling: We believe a holistic approach is required to create an integrated national recovery and recycling system. We support developing a cost-effective Deposit Return System DRS as one aspect of this approach. Changing customer behaviour: Once consistent recycling infrastructure is in place, we can help customers recycle more with simple, clear information. Tackling food waste Five years ago, we made a commitment to lead on reducing global food waste in our own operation, supply chains, and in our customers' homes. Food waste is a global challenge and through our international markets and Dave Lewis's Chairmanship of the international Champions 12.3 coalition, we are committed to driving progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal target to halve per capita global food waste by 2030. Products Sourcing with care In our UK supply chains, we are prioritising the environmental and social risks associated with 20 of our most important products and ingredients - from beef and coffee, to wild fish and cotton. To view the full top 20 list and some of the actions we are taking, visit www. Collaboration with suppliers, industry organisations, government bodies and civil society is vital for us to make progress. For example, we know that soil degradation is a key issue facing agricultural products and the environment. We analysed the most vulnerable regions we sourced from and in 2017 we started a new project in partnership with the Broads Authority and with the support of the Rivers Trust, National Farmers Union NFU and the Environment Agency. To raise awareness of the impact of water run-off with potato growers in East Anglia, we tested new technologies that help retain valuable top soil and reduce the amount of fertiliser entering local waterways. Working with partners, we will share the learnings in other key sourcing regions. This year, as part of our human rights due diligence approach, we have engaged stakeholders and other businesses to further understand the risks of forced labour in palm oil supply chains. 100% of the palm oil used in our Own Brand products in the UK is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil but we want to take further action to mitigate the social challenges associated with palm oil production. Our engagement has helped us identify and understand the areas of greatest risk, and we are working collaboratively through the Consumer Goods Forum to tackle this challenge as an industry. com sourcing for more information and www. com modernslavery for our latest Modern Slavery Statement. A healthier place to work and shop For many years we'five worked hard to help colleagues and customers make healthier food choices. We are also continuing to work with our suppliers to reduce the amount of sugar, fat and salt in thousands of products. In Central Europe in 2017 we reviewed 120 Own Brand soft drinks and introduced a new standard to limit the sugar to less than 1 teaspoon per 100ml. This follows the UK business which, by November 2016, had reduced the sugar in all Own Brand soft drinks to below the threshold for the government levy. We'five also helped increase consumption of fruit and vegetables by introducing new, great value ranges such as Farm Brands and Perfectly Imperfect. Our Free Fruit for Kids initiative remains popular in the UK and since 2016, we have given out 50 million pieces of free fruit in 800 stores. In May 2017 we held our first ever in-store health event in the UK. As part of this we reduced the price of 200 healthier products and highlighted in-store and online products which are lower in sugar, fat or salt. As a result, we saw the biggest monthly improvement in the health of our customers' In 2017 18, the 10 million tonnes of food sold in the UK retail operations generated 73,340 tonnes 0.7% of surplus. 53,126 tonnes 0.5% was wasted, which we sent for energy recovery. Of this, just 19,898 tonnes 0.2% was safe for human consumption. In September 2017 we also shared our 2016 17 food waste data for the Republic of Ireland and Central Europe for the first time. The page opposite gives a breakdown on our food surplus and waste in all these markets for 2017 18. In 2016, we made the commitment that no food that is safe for human consumption will go to waste from our UK retail operations by the end of 2017 18. We have worked hard to deliver our target through the launch of new industry leading initiatives. Surplus food safe for humans is offered to local charities through Community Food Connection. Food not taken by charities is offered to colleagues through our 'colleague shops' which have been rolled out to all stores. We send any suitable remaining surplus to animal feed. We have achieved huge progress in ensuring more good food goes to charity and we are now introducing a further programme of work to ensure no food safe for human consumption goes to waste. Our other markets share the same ambition and food redistribution programmes are now in all stores in the Republic of Ireland and all hypermarkets in Bangkok and Malaysia. In Central Europe over 600 stores out of a total 961 are already donating surplus food and all remaining stores will be donating by 2020. We are also working in partnership with our suppliers to offer customers the food they love with less waste. In 2017 18, we introduced resealable salad bags across our most popular salad lines and became the first UK supermarket to start selling perfectly ripe green satsumas and clementines that stay fresher for longer. In Central Europe, we introduced our Perfectly Imperfect range which has helped save over 6,000 tonnes of 'wonky' fruit and vegetables from going to waste. With 25 of our largest suppliers, we have announced a joint commitment to adopt UN Sustainable Development Goal target 12.3, measure and publish food waste data for their own operations and act to reduce food waste farm to fork. We are planning to build on this work over the coming year across more of our supply chains and communicate with customers on how they can reduce food waste in the home.

In 2017 18 we started to trial a new app in the UK that allows colleagues to see their shifts, manage overtime and request holiday. In time the app will also give the option to swap shifts, request shift changes and even take shifts in different stores - providing them with genuine flexibility and control over their hours. We have committed to rolling out this app in all our markets and have already started to introduce a simplified version in our Asian stores. Our UK apprenticeship programme aims to give over 1,000 colleagues, of all ages and all levels of experience, the opportunity to continue their education and build skills for their future. With technology transforming society, we are also developing a training programme to ensure that all our colleagues have the digital competence and confidence to succeed. Inclusivity and creating a culture where everyone has equal opportunity remains integral to our business. In January 2018 we pledged support to the UN standards promoting the rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex LGBTI people. More recently we signed up to the 30% Club, demonstrating our commitment to having strong female representation within our senior leadership team by 2020. The ratio of male to female colleagues at 2017 18 year-end is outlined in the table below. Further analysis of our gender pay gap can also be found in the Corporate governance report on page 47 or online. Places In 2017 18 we have continued to support communities through our community donation initiatives. We have established programmes in the UK Bags of Help, Republic of Ireland Community Fund and Central Europe You Choose, We Help. All of these programmes put the power in the hands of our customers to choose the local projects that Tesco supports financially. In Central Europe one in every four customers voted in 'You Choose, We Help'. Through these programmes we have distributed over PS51m and supported more than 24,000 local projects to date. Wherever we operate we also work closely with food banks and local charities to help feed people in need in local communities. In 2017 18 we donated the equivalent of 46 million meals to help feed people in need across the UK, Republic of Ireland, and Central Europe through our food surplus redistribution programmes. In January 2018, all our stores in Malaysia also participated in a campaign which enabled customers to donate food to 100 local charities supporting vulnerable families and homeless people. In Thailand, customer fundraising meant that underprivileged children were able to have nutritious lunches throughout February 2018.

The location-method impact is provided for disclosure only and all intensity, net and gross emissions shown are calculated using the market-based method. Foundations Climate change In May 2017, we announced the new science-based targets on the right, which are aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement recommendation of a 1.5 degree global warming trajectory. They will also enable us to meet our ambition to become a zero-carbon business by 2050. Our carbon footprint is calculated according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and our net carbon footprint in 2017 18 was 3.4 million tonnes of CO 2 e. For our own operations absolute carbon emissions we achieved a 13% reduction compared to last year and 26% compared to 2015 16. To help us achieve our new targets, we have committed to source 100% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. In 2017 18, 55% of our electricity across the Group was from renewable sources and in the UK we have already switched to 100% renewable purchased electricity, supported by renewable energy certificates. This, in addition to investments in energy efficiency, has enabled us to reduce our net carbon intensity per sq. ft. of retail and distribution floor space by 6% compared with last year, and 15% since 2015 16. Our targets Reduce absolute carbon emissions from our operations from 2015 16 levels: 35% by 2020, 60% by 2025 and 100% by 2050. Source 65% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2020 and 100% by 2030. Anti-bribery and fraud We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethics and integrity in the way we do business around the world. We adopt a zero tolerance approach to bribery and fraud at Tesco and expect our business partners to do the same. Our Code of Business Conduct outlines our most important legal obligations and the policies that guide the conduct of all our colleagues in areas including health and safety, information security, bribery and fraud. In February 2018, we refreshed all our communications on the Code and held an internal campaign to encourage colleagues to speak up if they have any concerns the Code is not being followed. To support this culture, we also provide an independent and confidential whistleblowing service - Protector Line - that enables our colleagues, suppliers and their staff around the world to raise concerns. We use e-learning to support compliance with the Code and anti-bribery and anti-fraud training is included in our annual refresher training for all relevant colleagues. Everyone in the business must comply with the Code and we have implemented annual Code compliance declarations which are reviewed by our Group Risk and Compliance Committee. 21 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Strategic report 73538 Tesco AR18 Text pages Bk 180420 HR.",

      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE Driver": "- **Asset Turnover increased** significantly from approximately 4.23 to 5.08, indicating **improved asset efficiency** in generating sales.\n- This improvement suggests the company is managing its asset base more effectively, likely driven by **strong sales growth** and better utilization of resources.\n- **Profit Margin also increased** from roughly 1.72% to 2.07%, reflecting enhanced **operational profitability** and cost control.\n- The rise in profit margin is consistent with the reported **cost reduction initiatives** and focus on **profitable sales growth** noted in the annual report.\n- Both drivers of ROE\u2014asset turnover and profit margin\u2014are **strengthening**, signaling a robust improvement in overall **return on equity**.\n- The **dominant contributor to ROE improvement** appears to be the asset turnover increase, given its larger relative change.\n- The company\u2019s **ongoing turnaround plan**, including simplification of operations and improved customer propositions, supports expectations of continued asset efficiency gains.\n- Profitability is expected to remain stable or improve modestly, supported by **margin expansion strategies** and **cost-saving programs**.\n- The annual report's emphasis on **free cash flow generation** and **margin guidance** within 3.5%\u20134.0% suggests confidence in sustaining these improvements over the next quarter and year.\n- Overall, both asset efficiency and profitability drivers align positively with **investor value creation**, indicating a **healthy financial trajectory**.",

Retail has changed a lot in that time, and so has our business. \" Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive Group Chief Executive's review This year has been an important milestone for Tesco. In 2019, we are celebrating 100 years since Jack Cohen first set up his East London market stall - and reiterating our commitments to great value for customers. It's also an important milestone in the turnaround that we began in 2015, and which we are successfully delivering - and I'm confident we will finish the job in 2019 20. After four years of turnaround, we have made significant progress. We have transformed the Tesco brand: significantly reduced our cost base: generated PS2.5bn of retail operating cash this year, and achieved a Group operating margin for the full year of 3.45% - reaching 3.96% in the second half of the year. We have also released PS1.7bn of value from our property portfolio since the start of our turnaround, and built a culture of innovation. Our balance sheet is stronger too, with total indebtedness of PS 22 bn in 2015 reduced to PS 12 bn at the end of this year. Importantly, the progress we are making is broad-based. In the UK, we have rebuilt the competitiveness of our offer: in Central Europe, we have simplified our business and delivered a significant cost reduction programme: and in Asia, we have successfully renegotiated terms with our suppliers, supporting our profit recovery. This strong financial performance is driven by a strategic decision to manage our business with a long-term focus on four key metrics: customer satisfaction, cash profitability, free cash flow and earnings growth. It also reflects the plans we have delivered this year to create value for each of our key stakeholders - our customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders. We have continued our focus on providing customers with quality products at great prices. Our customers' perceptions of quality and value have continued to improve throughout our turnaround, and more customers are recommending Tesco as a place to shop. Our customer offer is stronger, with almost 10,000 Own Brand products relaunched in the UK. Importantly, this includes completing the roll-out of our entry-level product tier in the UK, introducing eight new 'Exclusively at Tesco' brands. These products offer exceptional value and customers are responding very positively. In Asia, we have launched almost 600 new Own Brand products, with positive customer feedback and an increase in Own Brand sales participation in both Thailand and Malaysia. We continue to help our customers who want to make healthier choices and in September, through our health event in UK stores - our first in partnership with Jamie Oliver - we offered a basket of 'helpful little swaps' which was 12% cheaper than a standard basket. As part of our centenary celebrations, we have also launched a new store format in the UK, Jack's - which proudly supports Britain's food producing communities, with eight out of ten Jack's branded food and drink products grown, reared or made in Britain - and offers customers a no-fuss approach, with a low-cost business model. In Central Europe, we have launched 'Star Lines', with more than 600 products benchmarked on quality and price against the market, so that customers can shop with confidence. We have also continued our Food Love Stories campaign, sharing our passion for food and showcasing the quality of our products. And at Tesco Bank, we have launched new technology to simplify banking for customers, including an improved mobile app, which is now the preferred method of account access for 1.2 million customers. com ar2019 to hear more from Dave Lewis. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 3 Strategic report Colleagues. We want Tesco to be a great place to work for all of our colleagues, and to make it easier for them to do what they do best - serving our shoppers. In November, we implemented the final stage of a 10.5% pay increase for our hourly-paid UK store colleagues. We have a consistent principle that we aim to pay all colleagues competitively against the relevant pay benchmark. Last year, we launched our National Charity Partnership, bringing together three of the UK's leading health charities: Cancer Research UK, the British Heart Foundation and Diabetes UK. Through that partnership, we are helping our colleagues to lead healthier lives, and this year we conducted the UK's largest ever workplace health survey, with more than 8,000 colleagues taking part. More than 20,000 colleagues have also benefited from e-learning to support mental wellbeing. We are committed to offering good career opportunities, and this year over 1,000 colleagues took part in one of our apprenticeship programmes, supporting existing Tesco colleagues to develop new skills and helping young people start their career. In Ireland, we were particularly pleased to be independently recognised as a top Irish workplace for a second year, as well as being named one of the best workplaces for women, reflecting our aim to give everyone an equal opportunity to get on. Tesco continues to be a place where people can develop, and access a huge breadth of opportunity. However, this has also been a significant year of change for our business, which has had an impact on our colleagues. These changes are necessary as we respond to changes in the way that customers shop with us, and will ensure that we are operating our business sustainably. Whenever we make any change in our business, our priority is always to support our colleagues, and to stay true to our values. No one tries harder for customers We treat people how they want to be treated Every little help makes a big difference Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 4 Suppliers. We continue to strengthen the partnerships we have with our suppliers. For a third successive year, we ranked first in the independent supplier Advantage survey, and our Supplier Viewpoint measure for the Group reached a high of 77.5% in the second half of the year. Our close, trusted partnerships with suppliers allow us to deliver great quality products to our customers, at great value. We are committing to long-term strategic relationships with our closest supplier partners, supporting them to invest in improving the value and quality of our products, and increasing the efficiency of our supply chain. This year we have also worked together with our suppliers to make sensible preparations for Brexit, seeking to protect service and availability for our customers. As we grow our business, that presents an opportunity for our partners to grow with us too. Through our merger with Booker, suppliers can access the combined growth of a Group which serves not just the retail market, but also wholesale and food eaten 'out of home'. Our alliance with Carrefour presents a further opportunity for growth, covering the strategic relationship with global suppliers, the joint purchasing of Own Brand products and goods not for resale. We're also working with suppliers to make products healthier and more sustainable. In Thailand, we became the first retailer to bring all our Own Brand soft drinks below 6g of sugar per 100ml and we have removed trans fats from all Tesco bakery items. In the UK, we have worked with our suppliers to remove more than 2,900 tonnes of hard to recycle materials from our Own Brand products. 358 suppliers worked with us to develop 1,800 products for our new Jack's brand Alternative performance measures referred to in this statement are defined in the Glossary on pages 178 to 181. 5 Strategic report Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 Group Chief Executive's review continued Shareholders. We continue to create long-term, sustainable value for shareholders, investing in our competitiveness in all of our markets and being more selective in the mix of products we sell, moving away from loss-making categories. We have made a number of key decisions to support this, including the closure of Tesco Direct, stepping back from unprofitable general merchandise sales in Central Europe, and an accelerated transformation plan in Asia. We are delivering the synergies from our merger with Booker, with PS79m realised in this first year, and we are well on track to meet our target recurring run-rate of around PS200m per year by the end of the third year. Our Joining Forces programme continues at pace, with top Booker products now available in 70 Tesco stores and, for Booker customers, a significant improvement in the quality of the top 20 fastest-selling retail fruit and vegetable lines. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, reducing total indebtedness and lowering our interest costs. Reflecting our strong underlying financial performance, we are also proposing a final dividend of 4.10 pence, taking the full-year dividend to 5.77 pence, an increase of 92.3% year-on-year. We now expect to reach a dividend cover level of around two times earnings on a post-IFRS 16 basis in the 2019 20 financial year. It has been a strong year for Tesco, and the strategic decisions we have made are allowing us to grow our business sustainably. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our colleagues in delivering our plans, we have already met the vast majority of our turnaround objectives. This puts us in a good position to further invest in our competitiveness, and to face into challenging conditions in each of our markets, including: - the unlevel playing field created by the business rates system in the UK, which continues to place a significant burden on the retail industry, with our own bill at around PS700m each year: - changes to Sunday trading regulations in Poland which have impacted sales for Central Europe, contributing to a 2.3 % sales decline: and - the market in Thailand - which is highly competitive and challenging - and the issuance of government welfare cards, which had an impact of 1.2 % on Asia sales this year, although this had eased by the end of the fourth quarter. While these and other headwinds will continue, we will succeed by staying true to what we have always done best throughout our 100-year history: being a champion for customers. 6 More detail on our performance, including statutory results, can be found in our Financial review on pages 18 to 23. That means offering great value, the best quality, and helpful service. Jack Cohen did exactly that when he first set out his market stall, and the same spirit still drives Tesco today. It also means creating value in a wider sense, for communities and for society. We are committed to tackling the issues that matter - setting targets and measuring our progress against them. This year we have: - achieved 81% of our target that no food that is safe for human consumption should go to waste in our UK business: - donated the equivalent of 62.7 million meals to local charities and community groups in the UK, Ireland, Central Europe and Asia, and also launched a training programme with a goal to help more than 1,000 community cooks in the UK make the most of the donations they receive: - increased sales of healthy products by 17% year-on-year in our September 2018 'helpful little swaps' event: and - begun trials of a 'reverse vending' scheme for plastic bottles in the UK and Thailand. We are also partnering with external organisations, working together with shared ambitions. This year we have launched a new partnership with WWF, with the aim of reducing the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket by 50%. We are making good progress in each of the areas of our Little Helps Plan, and we want to go even further to achieve our goal of providing customers with affordable, healthy, sustainable food. One hundred years of great value. Over the last 100 years, Tesco has been an innovator, a disruptor, and above all it has listened to customers - meeting their needs better than anybody else. Retail has changed a lot in that time, and so has our business. From bringing self-service supermarkets to the UK, fighting against Resale Price Maintenance, delivering the first-ever online food shop or rewarding loyalty through Clubcard, Tesco has always been at its best when we are doing the right thing for customers. That has been the guiding principle of our four years of turnaround, and it continues to guide every decision we make today. As we celebrate our centenary, we are in a strong position. It's a moment to reflect on our past - but also to look ahead to the future. And as we do so, our focus is clear: to create long-term, sustainable value for every stakeholder in our business, for many years to come. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 7 Strategic report Jack's first store: In 1929, Jack set up shop in North London under the Tesco name. Tesco comes from the initials 'TES' of T. E. Stockwell, a tea supplier and partner of Jack's, as well as the 'CO' from Jack's surname. 1920s Celebrating 100 years of great value A born entrepreneur: Jack Cohen founded Tesco in 1919. Jack took his PS30 demob money at the end of the First World War, bought some surplus army food and got himself a pitch. By the end of that first morning he'd taken PS4, of which PS1 was his own. And he worked hard to give customers what they needed. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 8 A lot has changed since Jack Cohen set up his market stall in 1919, but not our commitment to great value. We're proud to be celebrating our centenary, promising great value for customers, colleagues and communities. 9 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 Strategic report Celebrating 100 years of great value. Fighting for customers: When Britain went to war in 1939, this time Jack fought on the home front, for fair food rationing. He worked with Government on a simple points system, where everyone was treated equally, rich or poor. Checkout at Tesco: We closed our stores and took the competition by surprise with the launch of a major price-cutting initiative called 'Checkout at Tesco'. Our simple, low prices were an overnight success. Value at the pumps and a legacy to remember: We changed the rules of fuel retailing, as we opened our first Tesco petrol stations - giving customers another great reason to shop with us. But it was also the end of an era, as Jack Cohen passed away in 1979. Something for nothing: We introduced Green Shield stamps in 1963, and they soon became a national phenomenon. These stamps could be exchanged for a range of goods in our Green Shield catalogue, giving customers even better value at Tesco. 1930s 1970s 1977 1960s Jack is back: We unveiled a new brand and stores, inspired by and named after Jack Cohen. Jack's brings customers great-tasting food at the lowest possible prices. Our centenary: We celebrate one hundred years of great value. Life in Britain has changed a lot since Jack made his first sale but today, serving shoppers better still starts with selling great quality food at affordable prices. In our centenary year, we're doing that in more ways than ever with exceptional deals that take customers back. More ways to shop: By 2000, technology had moved on a lot since our first home delivery in 1984 - and so had our business. com, which today serves millions of customers every month. In the same decade, we also launched our F&F clothing brand and Tesco Bank. The game changers: We launched our iconic 'Every Little Helps' strapline, in a decade full of little helps for our customers - from the introduction of Clubcard, to the launch of our first Express and Extra stores, making it even more convenient for customers to shop with us. We also launched our Tesco Value range, offering our customers a wider choice of products at great prices. 1990s 2018 2000s 2019 UK & ROI Central Europe Asia Tesco Bank 79% 11% 8% 2% Group sales PS56,883m We're passionate about serving shoppers a little better every day, in store and online.

A strong and differentiated brand creates long-term value for every stakeholder in our business. Our purpose, to serve shoppers a little better every day, is at the heart of what our brand stands for. As we celebrate our centenary year, we are looking back to the ethos of our founder, Jack Cohen, and what made Tesco unique: his unwavering, simple commitment to great value. That same commitment remains true today, and throughout 2019 we are doing that in more ways than ever before, with exceptional deals that take customers back, through our 'One Hundred Years of Great Value' campaign. This year we have made further progress in our relaunch of more than 10,000 Own Brand products - the largest launch of its kind in our 100-year history - bringing our customers great quality products at the very best prices. We have also continued our awardwinning Food Love Stories campaign, highlighting the quality of our food and showcasing the care that goes into every one of our products. Encouragingly, customers and stakeholders continue to recognise our efforts, and this year our YouGov BrandIndex score reached its highest rating since October 2011. To ensure that our business remains sustainable for the long term, we continue to simplify the way we operate and reduce our costs. We delivered in-year cost savings of PS532m, with PS1.4bn of savings to date towards our PS1.5bn ambition. Reducing our costs is particularly important as we face into challenging conditions in each of our markets across the Group, so that we can be even more competitive, and offer customers the value, quality and service that they expect. We are simplifying our store operations, improving stock flow, and further improving our forecasting to reduce waste. In our Express stores, we have optimised our distribution and replenishment by adjusting case sizes, reducing handling and transport costs. We have also taken the difficult decision to close around 90 of our fresh food counters in the UK, with the remaining 700 trading with either a full or flexible offer. This reflects changes to the way customers shop in these stores, and will allow us to operate more sustainably for the long term. In Central Europe, we have reduced costs by simplifying work for colleagues in stores - for example by reducing the number of price changes by almost a third. We maintain a strategic focus on generating free cash flow, and this year generated PS2.5bn of retail operating cash, driven by improved profitability. Strong working capital management is also a key component of our cash generation. Retail operating cash flow for this year is reported after a c. PS 490 m working capital timing impact year-on-year. This includes a year-on-year timing impact of PS 278 m relating to delayed payments following the failure of a key supplier, Palmer & Harvey, at the end of the last financial year. A further PS 210 m impact relates to decisions made in the second half of the year. Most significantly, the delayed implementation of a new general ledger system in the UK & ROI postponed the collection of some receivables into the beginning of the 2019 20 financial year. In addition, a focus on safeguarding availability and service levels for customers at a time of political uncertainty meant we deprioritised certain ongoing working capital initiatives. Over the last three years we have generated PS8.6bn of retail operating cash. Reduce operating costs by PS1.5bn Generate PS9bn cash from operations Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 14 4. Across the Group, we are working on mix - making our business more sustainable, and stepping back from unprofitable sales. Group operating margin for the year was 3.45%, up 59 basis points. In the second half of the year, on the same basis as our ambition excluding Booker, Group operating margin was 3.79%. We have taken some significant decisions to strengthen our mix, including the closure of our loss-making general merchandise website, Tesco Direct, where we saw no route to profitability. In Central Europe, we remain focused on building a more sustainable business. In Poland, we closed 62 unprofitable stores in the year, and we are reducing the costs of operating our business as we focus on profitable sales. We have also introduced more than 600 'Star Lines' for customers across our four Central European markets, giving more space on the shelf to the most popular products, at sharper prices. In Asia, we have repositioned our customer offer in Thailand, with significant changes to our sales mix and promotional strategy, as well as accelerating changes to our operating model, which are helping to underpin our profit recovery. We will continue to look at opportunities to improve our mix, allowing us to become more competitive for customers, and to deliver strong, sustainable returns for shareholders. This year we released a further PS285m of value from our property portfolio across the Group. In the UK, we are continuing to explore a small number of opportunities to work with a third-party to redevelop our store sites in high-value locations. For example, this year, working with a selected development partner, we have created a plan which will transform our store in Kennington, London. As well as making better use of the space to create hundreds of new homes, the project will also deliver a brand new Tesco store, further commercial space and will open up the site, bringing communities in the local area closer together. We continue to repurpose space in some of our larger stores, introducing thirdparty concessions from popular brands, as well as services like barbers. In Central Europe, we have simplified our property portfolio as we exit our department store format. We have also repurposed space in 14 of our hypermarkets, and introduced 22 new anchor tenants into our malls. We completed three property buybacks in the year in the UK, and our proportion of freehold property across the Group has remained stable year-on-year at 58%. A continuous pipeline of innovation ensures that we can keep serving shoppers better - anticipating and responding to their needs better than anybody else. Creating a culture of innovation across our business remains a priority and, to support this, we opened a new facility this year at our Welwyn Garden City campus. The 'Heart' building brings together our capabilities in product development, customer insight, colleague learning and retail technology - including a state of the art Express store, and kitchens where our colleagues and supplier partners can develop new products together. We're also innovating to make our products healthier, and more sustainable. When we reformulate products, wherever possible we make them healthier, without compromising on taste. This year we have added extra fibre to chilled breads and savouries, and reduced the sugar in our core Own Brand baked beans by 20%. We'five launched new packaging to reduce our impact on the environment and prevent waste, like our avocado packs, which now stay fresher for two days longer. As the way people shop continues to change, we are also innovating in the way we serve them. We'five launched a new brand in the UK - Jack's - as part of our centenary celebrations. In Thailand, we have also launched a new convenience proposition, to better meet our customers' needs.

Sustainable growth in sales is important to our business model. A strong, growing business also creates opportunities for our suppliers to grow with us too. Group sales is a measure of revenue excluding sales made at petrol filling stations. It demonstrates the Group's underlying performance in the core retail and financial services businesses by removing the volatilities associated with the movement in fuel prices. Group sales grew by 11.3% at constant exchange rates to PS56.9bn, and this year was our third consecutive year of sales growth. Booker was consolidated into the Group for 51 weeks from 5 March, contributing 11.4% to Group sales growth. Our key performance indicators Our Big 6 KPIs. We have six simple key performance measures for the whole business. Recovering our profitability has been key to our turnaround, building a platform for long-term growth and creating value for all stakeholders. Group operating profit, before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles. It is the headline measure of the Group's performance. Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was PS2,206m, up 33.5% at constant exchange rates. We have reduced our operating costs, and continued our focus on delivering profitable growth and improving the quality of our sales. Strong cash generation is an important part of our underlying philosophy as we manage our business. Retail operating cash flow is the cash generated from operations of continuing operations, excluding the effects of Tesco Bank's cash flows. It is a measure of the cash generation and working capital efficiency by the Retail business, recognising that Tesco Bank is run and regulated independently from the Retail operations. We generated retail operating cash of PS2,502m, down 9.8 %. This is reported after a c. PS 490 m working capital timing impact year-on-year, including a timing impact of PS 278 m following the failure of a key supplier, Palmer & Harvey, at the end of the last financial year. A further PS 210 m impact relates most significantly to the delay of the implementation of a new general ledger system in the UK & ROI, and additionally the deprioritisation of some ongoing working capital initiatives at a time of political uncertainty.

Our supplier satisfaction measure reflects the percentage of suppliers across the Group who responded positively when asked \"Overall how satisfied are you with your experience of working with Tesco? \", in our Supplier Viewpoint survey. Overall supplier satisfaction was 77.5%, up 2.6pts, the highest ever score recorded for the Group.

Results this year include the consolidation of Booker for 51 weeks since our merger completed on 5 March 2018. Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was up 34.0% to PS2,206m, as we continue to simplify the business and reduce costs, and we achieved a second half operating margin of 3.96% 3.79% excluding Booker. Our statutory profit before tax increased to PS2,153m including PS 53 m of exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles. We delivered a strong performance on net debt excluding Tesco Bank which was PS 2.9 bn, after PS 766 m of Booker cash consideration. We are continuing to focus on customer satisfaction, cash profitability, free cash flow and earnings growth and are using these measures to inform our decisions as we look to create sustainable value for shareholders. Reflecting our continued improved performance and confidence in ongoing cash generation, the Board has proposed the payment of a 4.10 pence per share final dividend following on from the interim dividend of 1.67 pence per share.

Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 18 Tesco' contributed to our overall UK market sales and volume outperformance during the fourth quarter. In general merchandise, we continue to focus on sustainable categories that complement the grocery shop. We are driving growth in those categories by differentiating our offer. For example, our Fox & Ivy and Go Cook ranges contributed to like-for-like sales growth of 4.2% in our Home category. Our clothing like-for-like sales grew by 3.0% and in February 2019 we launched selected F&F Womenswear items on Next. We closed Tesco Direct from 9 July, with our like-for-like sales performance removing the impact of this closure. All store formats and channels delivered like-for-like sales growth, with particularly strong performance in our convenience business, including One Stop, where we launched a further 100 Own Brand products, offering excellent quality and value to customers. Our online grocery sales grew by 2.8% year-on-year including our biggest ever sales week at Christmas with nearly 51 million items delivered and 776,000 orders. We have seen a strong response to the launch of Jack's - our new brand and store format - with a net promoter score of 53% and very high levels of customer awareness. Booker's like-for-like sales grew by 11.1% 10.8% excluding tobacco during the year, including a strong performance from symbol group stores. Sales growth in the fourth quarter eased as we started to annualise contract wins secured in the prior year. We are continuing to unlock the benefits of Joining Forces for Booker's customers, with greater choice, lower prices and better quality. In ROI, like-for-like sales grew by 1.3%. In a competitive market, we have continued to make good progress during the year, growing volumes across all food categories. UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was PS1,537m, up 45.1%, with operating margin growth of 62 basis points year-on-year. During the year, our cost savings programme progressed well and we further simplified what we do and how we serve customers in our store operations and in head office. Our strategic ambition to maximise the mix led to our focus on more sustainable general merchandise categories, including closing Tesco Direct in July. The operating loss relating to Tesco Direct was PS 94 m in the 2017 18 financial year. UK & ROI operating profit also includes a benefit of PS52m relating to a change in Clubcard accounting estimates. The change follows a detailed review of our accounting treatment ahead of the implementation of IFRS 15 and results in a more precise match between the redemption value per point and the historic issuance value. Booker contributed PS196m to operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles for the 51 weeks consolidated since completion of our merger on 5 March 2018. We delivered PS79m of the synergies identified in the Booker merger process - ahead of our initial expectation of PS60m in the first year - and are well on track to deliver our target of c. PS200m synergies per annum by the end of the third year. We now anticipate that exceptional integration costs over the three years will total PS 50 m-PS 75 m, lower than the PS 145 m which had been originally planned. Excluding Booker operating profit and synergies, UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was up 19.2%, with margin expansion of 39bps. In Central Europe, overall like-for-like sales declined by 2.3 %. A planned reduction of unprofitable general merchandise sales, including a decision not to participate in Black Friday promotions, impacted like-for-like sales performance by 1.2 % for the full year. In addition, changes to Sunday trading regulations in Poland resulted in 25 fewer trading days in the year which, in addition to a public holiday announced at short notice, impacted like-for-like sales in the region by 1.3 %. Sunday trading regulations effective from January 2019 mean that our stores in Poland are now only able to open on the last Sunday of each month, compared with two Sundays per month previously. In the second half, we saw a strong customer response as we launched our 'Star Lines' initiative across the region, reducing the price of more than 600 key products.

We are improving the quality of our business by focusing on more sustainable product categories and reducing less profitable ranges, such as electricals. In addition, operating costs are being reduced across the region as we simplify the store service model, for example, we reduced the number of price changes by 28% in the year. In Poland, we closed 62 loss-making stores which contributed to Poland making a small profit in the second half.

Like-for-like sales performance improved to 3.0 % in the fourth quarter. For the year, we saw an impact of 1.2 % from the issuance of government welfare cards in Thailand but this had eased by the end of the fourth quarter. Asia operating profit before exceptional items was PS286m. In the first half, profit was impacted by the combined effect of sales deleverage, price investment and repositioning of promotional investment in Thailand. Performance improved significantly during the second half as we successfully concluded renegotiations with our suppliers and accelerated plans to restructure our store and office operations in Thailand. As a result, we have been able to recover our operating margin more fully and quickly than we had anticipated at the half-year stage. 2018 19 2017 18 Year-on-year change Revenue PS1,097m PS1,047m 4.7% Operating profit before exceptional items PS197m PS169m 16.6% Statutory operating profit PS167m PS145m 15.2% Lending to customers PS12,426m PS11,522m 7.8% Customer deposits PS10,465m PS9,245m 13.2% Net interest margin 3.8% 3.9% 0.1 % Risk asset ratio 18.4% 19.4% 1.0 % Tesco Bank has continued to focus on delivering a positive experience for our banking and insurance customers.

In a difficult and competitive insurance market, investment has been focused on retention of existing customers. Overall, active customer numbers have reduced by 1.0 % year-onyear with growth in banking offset by a reduction in insurance. Operating profit before exceptional items increased by 16.6% year-on-year to PS197m, including strong retail banking performance with both cards and loans continuing to perform well. The insurance contribution has fallen year-on-year, impacted by competitive market conditions, albeit partly offset by a PS13m one-off benefit relating to upfront recognition of insurance renewals following a Contact renewal with our third party insurance provider. Exceptional items of PS 30 m relating to Tesco Bank include a payment of PS 16 m in relation to a settlement agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority FCA following an online fraudulent attack on Tesco Bank in November 2016 and a Payment Protection Insurance PPI charge of PS 16 m recognised in the year. On an underlying basis, the cost-to-income ratio has improved to 56.2% from 60.0%. Lending balances rose 7.8% year-on-year to PS12.4bn, comprising PS3.8bn secured lending up 25% and PS8.7bn unsecured lending up 1.8%. The balance sheet remains strong and well positioned to support future lending growth from both a liquidity and capital perspective with a risk asset ratio of 18.4%. The Group has adopted IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' for the period ending 24 February 2019. IFRS 9 has been applied retrospectively at 25 February 2018 by adjusting the opening balance sheet at that date. For Tesco Bank, the adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in a decrease in opening total assets of PS223m, with a related deferred tax asset of PS57m. The overall impact on opening equity was therefore a reduction of PS166m. Exceptional items in operating profit. Exceptional items are excluded from our headline performance measures by virtue of their size and nature in order to reflect management's view of the underlying performance of the Group. Restructuring and redundancy costs of PS 220 m relate to the simplification of our business and working practices across the Group. These include charges of PS 38 m incurred as a result of the closure of our loss-making online general merchandise business, Tesco Direct. Provision for customer redress of PS 16 m relating to Tesco Bank, reflects additional costs in respect of PPI as a result of higher claim rates than previously estimated. PPI compensation claims must be made before the deadline of 29 August 2019. 2018 19 2017 18 Net restructuring and redundancy costs PS 220 m PS 102 m Provision for customer redress PS 16 m PS 24 m FCA obligations PS37m PS25m Property transactions PS105m PS79m Tesco Bank FCA charge PS 16 m - Booker integration costs PS 15 m - Release of provision relating to HMRC VAT appeal PS176m - Guaranteed minimum pensions GMP equalisation PS 43 m - Net impairment reversal of non-current assets and onerous lease provision PS10m PS53m Sale of Lazada PS7m PS124m Disposal of opticians business - PS38m Total exceptional items in statutory operating profit PS25m PS193m Amortisation of acquired intangible assets PS 78 m - Total exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles in statutory operating profit PS 53 m PS193m There is an exceptional credit of PS37m in relation to the Shareholder Compensation Scheme which comprises a provision release of PS17m as we have now processed all outstanding claims and an insurance recovery of PS20m. Exceptional profits on property transactions of PS105m have arisen from disposals within the UK and Central Europe. We have incurred a charge of PS 16 m relating to a settlement payment agreed with the FCA following an online fraudulent attack on Tesco Bank in November 2016. Booker integration costs of PS 15 m relate to costs incurred in integrating Booker within the Tesco Group, mainly focused on aligning distribution networks and operating platforms. In 2017 18, we recovered PS160m of VAT from HMRC following a favourable court ruling regarding the treatment of VAT on Clubcard rewards. We subsequently recognised a provision of PS176m for VAT and interest as HMRC appealed the court decision. Following HMRC's decision not to appeal a further court judgement in our favour in January this year, this provision has now been released. Following a recent High Court ruling on equalisation of guaranteed minimum pensions GMP, we have recognised a PS 43 m non-cash charge in respect of the Group's defined benefit pension liability. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 20 Net impairment reversal of non-current assets and onerous lease provision totals PS10m. This includes a net reversal of PS69m in property, plant and equipment, a charge of PS 14 m in software and intangible assets and a net charge of PS 44 m in onerous property provisions. Amortisation of acquired intangible assets is excluded from our headline performance measures. Our combination with Booker resulted in the recognition of goodwill of PS3,093m and a PS755m intangible asset, driving amortisation of acquired intangible assets of PS 78 m for the full year. The net effect of exceptional items and acquired intangibles amortisation on operating profit during the year was PS 53 m. This compares to a net PS193m last year, which includes PS124m profit on the sale of Lazada in June 2017. Joint ventures and associates, interest and tax. Our share of post-tax profits from joint ventures and associates before exceptional items was PS24m, an increase of PS30m year-onyear due to a further reduction in losses recognised in Gain Land, our associate in China. An exceptional gain of PS11m was also recognised on our share of profits from a mall disposal in Gain Land. 2018 19 2017 18 Interest payable on medium-term notes, loans and bonds PS 256 m PS 363 m Interest receivable on associated derivatives PS18m PS31m Net interest on medium-term notes, loans and bonds PS 238 m PS 332 m Other interest receivable and similar income PS22m PS44m Other finance charges and interest payable PS 57 m PS 70 m Capitalised interest PS1m PS2m Net finance cost before exceptional charges, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments PS 272 m PS 356 m Fair value remeasurements of financial instruments PS 153 m PS23m Net pension finance costs PS 89 m PS 162 m Exceptional charge - translation of Korea proceeds - PS 38 m Net finance costs PS 514 m PS 533 m Net finance costs before exceptional charges, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments reduced by PS84m year-on-year to PS 272 m. This improvement was mainly driven by a lower level of gross debt. We saw a PS94m reduction in net interest on medium-term notes, loans and bonds from PS 332 m to PS 238 m as a result of debt maturities and bond tenders. We undertook two bond tenders during the year which reduced interest payable by PS34m and we expect an annualised benefit of PS52m. Net finance costs of PS 514 m were PS19m lower year-on-year. Within net finance costs, fair value remeasurements includes PS 121 m relating to the premium paid on the repurchase of long-dated bonds. Net pension finance costs decreased by PS73m year-on-year to PS 89 m, driven by a lower opening pension deficit, partly offset by a higher discount rate. For 2019 20, net pension finance costs are expected to decrease to c. PS 72 m. Last year, an exceptional loss of PS 38 m arose on the translation of the proceeds from the sale of our Homeplus business in Korea. This translation effect did not represent an economic cost to the Group. Tax on Group profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was PS 413 m. The effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles for the year is 24.1%. This tax rate is higher than the UK statutory rate, primarily due to the impact of the 8% supplementary tax surcharge on bank profits and depreciation of assets that do not qualify for tax relief. We expect the impact of these items on the effective tax rate to reduce as our overall level of profitability continues to increase. Therefore, along with the additional impact from the UK corporation tax rate reducing by 2% from April 2020, we expect the effective tax rate to reduce to around 20% in the medium-term. The effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items for the 2019 20 financial year is expected to be around 22%. On a statutory basis, the total tax charge is PS 354 m which includes a PS59m credit relating to exceptional items. Cash tax paid in the year was PS370m up PS194m year-on-year including PS232m of corporate tax paid in the UK up PS157m year-on-year. This increase principally reflects our improved profitability and the benefit last year from utilising remaining UK tax losses. Earnings per share on a continuing operations basis. Our diluted earnings per share before exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments was 15.40p, 29.4% higher year-on-year principally due to our stronger profit performance. Statutory basic earnings per share from continuing operations were 13.65p, 12.3% higher year-on-year. 2018 19 2017 18 Movement Net debt excludes Tesco Bank PS 2,863 m PS 2,625 m PS 238 m Discounted operating lease commitments PS 6,999 m PS 6,931 m PS 68 m Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax PS 2,338 m PS 2,728 m PS390m Total indebtedness PS 12,200 m PS 12,284 m PS84m Overall, total indebtedness has decreased by PS84m year-on-year. Retail net debt increased by PS 0.2 bn to PS 2.9 bn, after the cash outflow of PS 0.8 bn relating to our combination with Booker. Discounted operating lease commitments increased by PS 68 m, including the consolidation of PS 0.4 bn Booker lease commitments. On 13 September 2018, we exercised our option to buy back the 50% equity holding in the Tesco Atrato Limited Partnership held by our property joint venture partner. The acquisition is scheduled to complete in September 2019, and will lead to a reduction in discounted lease commitments of PS400m undiscounted PS790m, and consolidation of the debt held by the joint venture. On an IAS 19 basis, our pension deficit net of deferred tax has reduced from PS2.7bn last year to PS2.3bn at the end of the current year. The movement during the year is primarily attributable to continued deficit contributions in addition to strong asset performance. Our key credit metrics, which are fixed charge cover and total indebtedness EBITDAR, have further improved since the end of the last financial year, from 2.7 to 3.2 times and from 3.3 to 2.8 times, respectively. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 21 Strategic report Summary retail cash flow. Retail operating cash flow of PS2,502m reflects a strong underlying improvement in cash profitability offset by a c. PS 490 m working capital timing impact year-on-year, driven by two factors. First, this year's working capital net outflow of PS 312 m includes payments of PS 139 m which were delayed from the last financial year following the failure of a key supplier Palmer & Harvey. Together with the corresponding benefit in last year's working capital net inflow, this creates a PS 278 m year-on-year timing impact. Second, a further PS 210 m impact within working capital relates to decisions made in the second half of 2018 19. The most significant of these relates to a decision to delay the implementation of a new general ledger system in the UK & ROI by a few months, which resulted in some receipts being postponed into the beginning of the 2019 20 financial year. In addition, we chose to deprioritise some ongoing working capital initiatives in order to safeguard availability and service levels for customers at a time of political uncertainty. 2018 19 2017 18 Operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles PS2,206m PS1,646m Less: Tesco Bank operating profit before exceptional items PS 197 m PS 169 m Retail operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles PS2,009m PS1,477m Add back: Depreciation and amortisation PS1,214m PS1,212m Other reconciling items PS94m PS28m Pension deficit contribution PS 266 m PS 245 m Underlying increase decrease in working capital PS 312 m PS493m Retail cash generated from operations before exceptional items PS2,739m PS2,965m Exceptional cash items: PS 237 m PS 192 m Relating to prior years: - Shareholder Compensation Scheme Payments and SFO Fine PS 43 m PS 149 m - Utilisation of onerous lease provisions PS 81 m PS 92 m - Restructuring payments PS 60 m PS 53 m Relating to current year: - Restructuring payments PS 68 m PS 67 m Other PS15m PS169m Retail operating cash flow PS2,502m PS2,773m Cash capex PS 1,126 m PS 1,190 m Net interest PS 283 m PS 297 m Tax PS 302 m PS 131 m Property proceeds PS285m PS253m Property purchases - store buybacks PS 136 m PS 393 m Market purchases of shares net of proceeds PS 146 m PS11m Acquisitions & disposals and dividends received PS 635 m PS362m Add back: Booker acquisition costs included in Acquisition & disposals above a PS747m - Retail free cash flow b PS906m PS1,388m a The cost of major acquisitions and disposals are removed from the Group's definition of free cash flow. b Retail free cash flow includes PS146m market purchases of shares net of proceeds in relation to share schemes. Last year's retail free cash flow has been restated by PS11m to reflect this. Financial review continued In addition to the working capital timing impacts, the lower level of retail free cash flow year-on-year principally reflects two factors. First, a higher tax charge as our profitability continues to improve and second, a net cash outflow of PS 146 m relating to the market purchase of shares. The market purchase follows our commitment to offset any dilution from the issuance of new shares to satisfy the requirements of share schemes. We expect to utilise a similar amount of cash in future years in line with this commitment, with the exact amount dependent on performance. Other items include an exceptional cash outflow of PS 43 m relating to final payments under the Shareholder Compensation Scheme which have now been processed. Exceptional cash items also include the utilisation of PS 81 m of our exceptional onerous lease provision in the year, of which PS 23 m related to one-off costs to surrender leases and PS 58 m related to ongoing lease agreements. We reduced cash capital expenditure by 5.3% year-on-year to PS 1.1 bn reflecting our disciplined approach to capital investment. In net cash interest, the benefit of lower interest paid was partially offset by the timing of PS55m of interest payable on our largest sterling-denominated bond. The timing of our year-end date has meant that last year's annual coupon payment on this bond was made in this financial year. Retail cash tax paid in the year was PS 302 m, higher than last year reflecting our improved profitability and the benefit last year from utilising remaining UK tax losses. We generated PS285m of proceeds from property sales including PS129m relating to Kennington and a number of small disposals in the UK, PS92m relating to three retail sites in Central Europe and PS58m relating to two Booker properties. We completed the buyback of Stroud superstore in the first half and Cirencester Extra and Shepton Mallet superstore in the second half. 2018 19 2017 18 UK & ROI PS709m PS676m Central Europe PS130m PS133m Asia PS235m PS239m Tesco Bank PS31m PS50m Group PS1,105m PS1,098m Capital expenditure shown in the table above reflects expenditure on ongoing business activities across the Group. Our capital expenditure for the year was PS1.1bn, a similar level to last year and lower than we originally anticipated for this year as we continue to exercise discipline in our investment decisions. In the UK & ROI, spend was focused on maintaining and refreshing our stores, alongside convenience store openings in the UK. Capital spend in Central Europe and Asia has remained at a broadly similar level as last year. The focus of spend in Central Europe was on repurposing our existing store estate and in Asia, spend primarily related to our new store opening programme in Thailand. Going forward, we expect our annual capital expenditure to remain within a range of PS1.1bn to PS1.4bn. Statutory capital expenditure of PS1.2bn includes PS136m relating to the three UK property buybacks. We reduced the total amount of retailing selling space across the Group by just under 1.7 million square feet in the year. Across Central Europe and Asia, our repurposing programme has Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 22 contributed a net reduction of 1.0 million square feet. In Central Europe, we have repurposed 669,000 square feet across 14 stores, partnering with H&M, Reserved, Decathlon and Rossman. In Asia, we have repurposed 26 stores, mainly in Thailand where we have partnered with Mr. DIY home improvement and additional leisure partners including cinemas and play centres. In the UK & ROI, we opened 24 new stores in the period, including 13 in our convenience formats in the UK and eight Jack's stores. We closed a further 20 stores in the UK, including two Booker stores. Our net reduction of 66 stores in Central Europe during the year was driven primarily by the closure of 62 stores in Poland. In Asia, we opened 72 stores including 70 in Thailand, principally in our convenience format. We closed a further 56 stores in Thailand as we optimise our convenience store network. The estimated market value of our fully owned property has increased by PS0.6bn to PS21.3bn, with PS0.2bn of this increase resulting from our merger with Booker. The market value of PS21.3bn represents a surplus of PS2.7bn over the net book value NBV. Our Group freehold property ownership percentage, by value, has remained stable at 58% year-on-year. In addition to an increase in market value of existing properties, we regained ownership of three stores in the UK. This was offset by the impact of consolidating Booker's 183 leasehold properties. The repurchase of the three UK stores will result in an annualised rental saving of PS7m. We continue to seek opportunities to further reduce our exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift rent inflation where the economics are attractive. Reflecting the continued improvement in the business and our confidence in ongoing cash generation, we propose to pay a final dividend of 4.10 pence per ordinary share. This takes the total dividend for the year to 5.77 pence per ordinary share, up 92.3% year-on-year, following the payment of an interim dividend of 1.67 pence per ordinary share in November 2018. We would then expect to maintain this level going forward, expressed as an earnings pay-out ratio of around 50%, with an anticipated split of broadly one-third to two-thirds between interim and final dividends in any given year. The proposed final dividend was approved by the Board of Directors on 9 April 2019 and is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 13 June 2019. The final dividend will be paid on 21 June 2019 to shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on 17 May 2019 the Record Date. Shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividend in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan DRIP. The last date for receipt of DRIP elections and revocations will be 31 May 2019. We are confident that we will meet the remaining goals in our turnaround plan in 2019 20 and deliver a level of profitability pre-IFRS 16 and excluding Booker within the 3.5%-4.0% margin range. Whilst the market remains uncertain, our performance to date is strong, leaving us well positioned to invest in our competitiveness as we continue to celebrate 100 years of great value for customers. We remain comfortable with consensus profit expectations for 2019 20. Tesco is introducing IFRS 16, the new financial reporting standard on accounting for leases, for its 2019 20 financial year. IFRS 16 has no economic impact on the Group. It has no effect on how the business is run, nor on cash flows for the Group. It does however have a significant impact on the way the assets, liabilities and the income statement for the Group are presented, as well as the classification of cash flows relating to lease contracts. The Group will adopt the standard fully retrospectively. Detail on the impact of IFRS 16 on our 2018 19 financial statements can be found in Note 36. The introduction of IFRS 16 has no bearing on the plans or financial ambitions Tesco has shared with the market. As a result of the progress we are making strengthening the balance sheet and delivering free cash flow, we now expect to reach a dividend cover level of around two times earnings in the 2019 20 financial year. We will maintain our focus on balance sheet strength, targeting a leverage range of 3 times to 2.5 times total indebtedness to EBITDAR on a post-IFRS 16 basis.

For the past 100 years we have been a business with a strong community spirit and a desire to do the right thing. We believe we can make a positive contribution to our colleagues, customers and communities through small actions that can add up to make a big difference. One of our values, 'Every little help makes a big difference', inspired our Little Helps Plan, which we launched two years ago. It aims to pull together all of our efforts and refocus our activities on the social and environmental challenges that matter most to our customers, colleagues, suppliers and stakeholders. Every week we serve nearly 80 million customers across eight countries and they tell us they want us to provide affordable, healthy, sustainable products. They also want us to look after our colleagues and the communities where we operate. We have listened to their views, and identified three pillars where we could make the biggest difference: our people, our products and our places. Underpinning these pillars are areas where we are committed to doing the right thing. These include important issues such as health and safety, cyber security and anti-bribery. We call these our foundations, as they are the bedrock of a responsible business and are fundamental to the way we operate. For more information on how we identified the pillars, visit: www. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 24 Embedding the Little Helps Plan. The Little Helps Plan is integral to our business strategy, helping us to serve our customers a little better every day and contributing directly to our strategic drivers. By addressing the key issues that we know matter to our customers, colleagues, suppliers and stakeholders, we are able to bring to life the meaning behind our value 'Every little help makes a big difference' and build a differentiated brand. Our ambitious targets are helping to stimulate innovation within the business - for example driving us to expand our range of innovative plant-based products or encouraging us to trial cutting edge technologies to help our customers recycle more. The Plan is also delivering real reductions in operating costs, such as through our work to reduce our carbon footprint. Our investment in energy efficiency between 2015 16 and 2017 18 has delivered PS37m in savings to date. To further embed the Little Helps Plan into our business and to measure our progress, we have introduced KPIs for each action set out in the Plan. We monitor these regularly to help guide our work. We first published progress against these in November 2018 and a further update can be found in our full Little Helps Plan report. This year we have realigned when we report progress against the Little Helps Plan - reporting at the same time as the Annual Report. Going forward we will continue to publish annual updates alongside the Annual Report. We have a robust governance framework in place to support us in delivering the Little Helps Plan and integrating it into our business strategy. This establishes clear responsibility and accountability for our performance, and ensures effective decision-making. Implementation begins in the UK. We then share learnings with our international markets to enable them to develop country-specific plans. Each pillar of the Plan is owned by a director within the relevant business function. These owners, in each country or region, are responsible for the day-to-day delivery of the Plan as well as tracking progress against the relevant KPIs. Each country or region has developed a three-year roadmap which is reviewed annually, with key priorities and deliverables set out for the year ahead. Our Corporate Responsibility Committee CRC is responsible for ensuring the Board devotes sufficient attention to corporate responsibility in its widest sense. The Committee has been on a number of visits in 2018 19 to see how our policies and programmes are working on the ground. For more information on the Committee and its activities, see page 55.

We cannot achieve our ambitions alone. Our relationships with our suppliers and expert partners are fundamental to the success of both our business and our implementation of the Little Helps Plan. For example, our Sustainable Farming Groups are essential in helping to secure the future of farming and building long-term relationships with our farmers. This year, we have established a four-year strategic partnership with WWF to help us tackle some of the environmental challenges we cannot address alone. Our overall goal is to halve the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket. We also continue to work with Cancer Research UK, Diabetes UK and the British Heart Foundation to promote healthier living to customers and colleagues. In line with UN Global Compact guidance, we have identified which of the UN Sustainable Development Goals SDGs are particularly relevant to us. com sdgs for more information on how our strategy supports the SDGs.

Our people make our business and we ensure Tesco is a place where everyone can get on, whatever their ambitions. To help our colleagues develop the skills they need to succeed, we offered 1,265 new UK apprenticeships last year, in areas such as Large Goods Vehicle LGV driving and food technology. Digital skills are increasingly important across our business, so we are working with the Makers Academy to offer colleagues opportunities to retrain as software development engineers. We are also training over 50 digital champions in our UK distribution centres to coach colleagues on practical digital skills and aim to start rolling this programme out to stores by the end of the year. 17,156 line managers have already attended our new manager training programme which covers how to support their colleagues in getting on. We are committed to helping the next generation. Last year, over 2,300 young people started their career or gained work experience with us through one of our early careers programmes. In the UK our Movement to Work programme has provided training and work placements for 629 unemployed young people and, through our partnership with the Prince's Trust and IGD, we have already helped over 6,500 school children develop employment skills. Our Business Service Centre in Bengaluru, India, has helped to open a new Career Development Centre for young people, offering nine vocational courses on areas such as digital literacy.

We have launched more ways to get active, free health checks, mental health support and a new financial wellbeing programme. Earlier this year we conducted the UK's largest ever workplace health survey, with our charity partners Cancer Research UK, Diabetes UK and the British Heart Foundation. 8,000 colleagues responded to the survey and it helped us identify new ways to support colleagues to live healthier lives, such as introducing a discounted gym pass. We want everyone to feel welcome and 84% of colleagues globally tell us there is an inclusive culture at Tesco. Our five established UK colleague networks play a big part in helping colleagues find support and mentoring. Our ambition for 2019 20 is to support our other markets to roll out networks relevant for their colleagues. We are members of the 30% Club and 31% of our Board is female. In the UK, we introduced a targeted career development community, which supported 80 talented female colleagues to drive their own career, build their network and grow as authentic leaders. We are committed to offering a fair and competitive total reward package and, in the last two years, have increased hourly rates for UK store colleagues by 10.5%. See page 65 for our gender pay analysis. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 26 Products. We believe that healthy, sustainable products should be affordable for everyone, regardless of their budget. This ambition guides our actions on health, sourcing, packaging and food waste. A healthier place to work and shop. Seven out of ten families say supermarkets should do more to help people make healthier choices, such as by making healthier alternatives more affordable and enjoyable. By gradually adjusting our products over a number of years, taking out a little fat, sugar and salt, or adding more vegetables or fibre, our customers can still buy their favourite foods every week while being a little healthier. In the UK over a third of our frozen and chilled ready meals now contain at least 1 of your 5 a day. In Thailand we are the first retailer to bring all our Own Brand soft drinks below 6g of sugar per 100ml and we have removed trans fats from all Tesco bakery items. To encourage customers to discover and try healthier alternatives that contain less fat, sugar or salt than standard products, we have now run three 'helpful little swaps' events in the UK. During our September 2018 health event, a basket of 'helpful little swaps' cost 12% less than a standard basket. Sales of these comparable products increased by 17% year on year. This was our first event fronted by Jamie Oliver since he joined Tesco as a health ambassador. To help colleagues and customers cook from scratch, he also created a series of healthier recipes and tips. As well as being delicious, we made sure they were affordable by reducing the costs of the main ingredients to encourage people to try them. Food production has a significant impact on our planet's natural resources. It also affects millions of livelihoods around the world. We want customers to feel reassured that our products have been sourced with respect for the environment and the people involved. We work in partnership with thousands of suppliers and producers to make sure that, as well as great quality, we offer the same ethical and environmental standards, across all our product ranges, at affordable prices. We have joined forces with WWF to make it easier for customers to buy affordable, healthy, sustainable food. Together, we will focus on helping customers eat more sustainably, restoring nature in food production and leading the food industry in eliminating food and packaging waste. One of the environments where we can make the biggest difference is forests. Global demand for food is putting significant pressure on these vital ecosystems. We have committed to achieving zero-net deforestation in our sourcing of agricultural raw materials by 2020. For Tesco, the most important of these materials is soy: a key ingredient in animal feed. We have taken a lead in the food industry in developing and implementing a soy sourcing programme that will ensure in the future 100% of the soy our suppliers use comes from zero-net deforestation sources. This follows our work on palm oil where all of the palm oil in our UK Own Brand products is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. We are also working towards all paper wood used in our UK Own Brand products being certified by the Forest Stewardship Council or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, or coming from a recycled source. In December 2018, we revised our human rights strategy to allow us to focus on the four issues that most affect the people in our supply chain. Work has already begun in each of these areas: Forced labour: Over 200 UK colleagues have received training to help them tackle modern day slavery risks in supply chains and our own operations. Gender equality: We have signed up to the UN's Women's Empowerment Principles and our partnership with the Ethical Tea Partnership and UNICEF in Assam has helped equip 35,000 adolescent girls with the knowledge and life skills to reduce their vulnerability to abuse and exploitation. Sustainable livelihoods: 5 pence from every pack of Tesco Extra Strong tea sold is donated to run community projects in two tea estates in Malawi. The first beneficiaries will be 10 Village Savings and Loan Associations which help increase incomes through simple savings and loan facilities. Worker representation: We are members of the 'ACT' agreement between global brands, retailers and trade unions to achieve living wages for garment workers through collective bargaining at industry level. 27 Strategic report Little Helps Plan continued Creating a closed loop for packaging. To make efficient use of valuable resources, and minimise environmental impact, we are committed to ensuring we never use more packaging than is needed, and what we do use is from sustainable sources and can go on to be reused or recycled. Our ambition is to create a closed loop for packaging across our UK operations, meaning no packaging will go to waste. To achieve this, government, industry and consumers all need to play a role and the UK recycling infrastructure has to be reformed. For our part, we have set three strategic priorities: simplifying materials and design to be fully recyclable, increasing recovery and recycling, and changing customer behaviour. Alongside our aim to halve packaging weight by 2025, we have committed to end the use of the hardest to recycle materials from our Own Brand packaging by the end of 2019. Thanks to the support of our suppliers, we are now over 60% towards meeting our commitment. In the past year we have donated surplus food equivalent to 62.7 million meals, across the UK, Ireland, Central Europe and Asia to local charities and community groups. All Tesco stores in the UK, Ireland and Malaysia offer surplus food as well as 747 stores in Central Europe and 40 stores in Thailand. We have also introduced 'colleague shops' in all our UK stores to help tackle food waste. Here we offer surplus food, not taken by local charities, to colleagues free of charge. Any remaining suitable bakery and produce is sent to animal feed. These combined initiatives have resulted in a 51% reduction in food safe for human consumption going to waste in the UK compared with last year. We have a shared responsibility to tackle food waste from farm to fork. The solution lies in working in partnership with our suppliers and helping customers reduce food waste in their homes. One example of this is that we have removed 'best before' dates from over 180 fruit and vegetable lines to help prevent perfectly edible items being thrown away too early. We are extending our approach and learnings to other markets. In Central Europe we have developed a tailored list of hard to recycle materials, taking into consideration local recycling infrastructure, and are working with suppliers there to eliminate these. In Thailand we have switched to recyclable thermoform plastic for our fresh meat and fruit-to-go products, reducing plastic waste by 12%. We are trialling a reverse vending scheme for plastic bottles in the UK and in Thailand, testing different rewards - such as vouchers and charity donations - to encourage people to get involved. We also have collection points in our large UK stores where customers can recycle plastic bags and polyethylene films that are not always accepted through kerbside collections, and are trialling a collection scheme in 10 stores for all bags, pouches, films and crisp packets to test a new recycling method. Every year, a third of the world's food goes to waste. As a food retailer, we have a responsibility to take action, which is why we have committed to helping halve food waste, from farm to fork, by 2030. This is in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goal target 12.3. Our Group Chief Executive, Dave Lewis, chairs a coalition of leaders from government, business, international organisations, research institutions, and civil society, called Champions 12.3, whose purpose is to encourage countries and food businesses globally to set targets, measure and publish their data, and act on the insights to tackle food waste. We were the first UK retailer to publish our food waste data and update it every year. This was followed by our businesses in Ireland and Central Europe, and now Booker. 27 of our largest Own Brand suppliers have published data on food waste in their own operations and 10 of our largest branded suppliers have committed to do the same, as well as take concrete steps to reduce food waste in the supply chain and in the homes of our customers. Our target is that no food that is safe for human consumption is wasted in our UK business. Over the last two years, as a result of our efforts, and in partnership with charities, we have reached 81% a of this target. Food that is damaged, or fresh food that cannot be frozen, is excluded from the scope of our target as we are unable to donate it to charities. 2,914 tonnes Hardest to recycle materials removed from our Own Brand packaging UK Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 28 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 29 Strategic report KPMG LLP was engaged to provide independent limited assurance over the selected food waste data highlighted in this report with a using the assurance standard ISAE 3000.

Method statements for each business are available at www. Little Helps Plan continued Places. Every week we serve nearly 80 million customers, in over 6,000 communities around the world. We are proud of the contribution we make through the jobs we provide, the businesses we work with and the local causes we support. In 2018 we published an independent report - Value in Your Town - to learn more about the socio-economic contribution we make to our communities in the UK and understand how we could better support them. In 2016 17 alone, we contributed an estimated PS37.3bn gross value added to the UK economy. We support causes and help address issues that colleagues and customers care about locally, such as food poverty. Wherever we operate, we work closely with food banks and local charities to help feed people in need in local communities. To increase the impact of our food redistribution scheme in the UK, we have launched the Tesco Community Cookery School programme to help community groups make the most of the surplus food that they receive from Tesco. Over 1,000 cooks will be given training and nutritious recipes, specially designed by Jamie Oliver and Tesco's food experts. We hope to expand the scheme to a train-the-trainer model, benefiting a further 5,000 community cooks. Another way we support communities is through our community grant programmes in the UK, Ireland and Central Europe. In the UK our Bags of Help scheme redistributes money raised from the sale of carrier bags to fund thousands of projects in local communities. To date PS70m has been invested in local communities, supporting over 23,000 projects chosen by customers - from improved outdoor spaces to training coaches or volunteers. Similarly, our Community Fund initiative in Ireland has donated EU3.7m to support over 13,000 selected local projects. For example, the Ballincollig Gymnastics Club in Cork has been able to buy a new fully sprung floor for the gym thanks to a donation from Tesco. Since the You Choose, We Help programme began in Central Europe, over 3,000 community groups have benefited. To offer further help to our causes in Central Europe, we trialled a volunteering scheme with colleagues at 40 stores. The programme is now being rolled out across the region with colleagues being encouraged to volunteer, during work hours, at the local organisations supported through You Choose, We Help. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 30 Foundations. Our Foundations are the things we take care of behind the scenes, on an ongoing basis, to make sure we remain a responsible, ethical business. They help us manage important evolving risks facing our business, from product safety to data security to health and safety. For information on how we are managing cyber security, product safety, and health and safety risks, see page 32. Business ethics. Our Code of Business Conduct sets down our minimum expectations for all colleagues, wherever they work and whatever their role. This includes important legal obligations and the policies that guide our conduct. It also lets colleagues know about Protector Line, a completely independent support service where they can raise concerns anonymously and confidentially. In October 2018, we updated our Code of Business Conduct to reflect changes to the law, our business and wider society that have taken place since the Code was written in 2015. We also set out clearer expectations about the conduct expected from all colleagues and from managers and senior leaders. Everyone in the business must comply with the Code and colleagues in office roles, along with store and distribution managers, are required to make an annual declaration of compliance. In 2019, more than 26,000 colleagues did so. We have a longstanding commitment to tackling climate change. We were the first FTSE 100 company to set ambitious sciencebased targets to become a zero-carbon business by 2050, in line with the 1.5-degree trajectory of the Paris Climate Agreement. We have also committed to source 100% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. In 2018 19 58% of our electricity, across the Group, was sourced this way. Our carbon footprint is calculated according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and our net carbon footprint in 2018 19 was 3.3 million tonnes of CO 2 e. For our own operations' absolute carbon emissions, we achieved a 9% reduction compared to last year and 31% compared to 2015 16. We are also supporting the move to a low-carbon economy. In November 2018 we announced the development of the largest UK retail electric vehicle charging network. In conjunction with Volkswagen, we will roll out over 2,400 EV charging bays across 600 Tesco stores within the next three years. As supporters of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures TCFD we are working to consider the impacts that climate change may have on our business. For more information, see page 177.

Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 31 Strategic report Principal risks and uncertainties A robust review. We have an established risk management process to identify, assess and monitor the principal risks that we face as a business. We have performed a robust review of the risks that we believe could seriously affect the Group's performance, future prospects, reputation or its ability to deliver against its priorities. This review included an assessment of risks we believe would threaten the Group's business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. We have reviewed our principal risks in line with our strategic drivers. The risks to the business, at a high level, remain unchanged from the previous year. We have reframed our customer risk definition to better reflect current circumstances, set out on page 33. The two shorter-term risks relating to Brexit as well as Booker synergy realisation and integration remain relevant. The risks associated with Brexit are increasing due to the possibility of a 'no deal' scenario and the potential for an abrupt departure from the EU. The Booker integration and synergy realisation risk is decreasing as good progress was made on the expected synergies. The risk management process relies on our assessment of the risk likelihood and impact and on the development and monitoring of appropriate internal controls. Our process for identifying and managing risk is set out in more detail on page 59. We maintain risk registers that discuss the principal risks faced by the Group and this is an important component of our governance framework and how we manage our business. As part of our risk management process, risks are reviewed as a top down and bottom up activity at the Group and the business unit level. The content of the risk registers are considered and discussed through regular meetings with senior management and reviewed by the Executive Committee. Each principal risk is discussed at least annually by the Board to provide oversight and ensure that they remain relevant. The table opposite sets out our principal risks, their link to our strategic drivers, their movement during the year, and a summary, of key controls and mitigating factors. The Board considers these to be the most significant Group risks that may impact the achievement of our six strategic drivers as set out on pages 14 and 15. They do not comprise all of the risks associated with the business and are not set out in priority order. Additional risks not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse effect on the business. The Board considers these to be the most significant risks faced by the Group that may impact the achievement of our six strategic drivers.

Uncertainties including Brexit and macro economic conditions squeeze our customers' budgets and force them to reappraise the concepts of value and loyalty in a way in which we are unable to respond. Ongoing fragmentation of our customer engagement channels exposes us to a risk of diluting customer experience and ability to differentiate our brand. We now have a more consistent approach to building impactful customer propositions, offering high-quality and competitive value while improving the customer experience. Propositions are now developed across channels and geographies to ensure consistency in the engagement with customers. Group-wide customer insight management is undertaken to understand and leverage customer behaviour, expectations and experience across the different parts of the business. We monitor the effectiveness of our processes by regularly tracking our business and competitors against measures that customers tell us are important to their shopping experience. We have well-established product development and quality management processes, which keep the needs of our customers central to our decision-making. Failure to achieve our transformation objectives due to poor prioritisation, ineffective change management and a failure to understand and deliver the technology required, resulting in an inability to progress sufficiently quickly to maintain or increase operating margin and generate sufficient cash to meet business objectives. Achieving our transformation goals continues to demand effort and investment, especially with regard to technology changes. We have multiple transformation programmes underway to simplify our business with clear market strategies and business plans in place which evolve as priorities or situations change. We have appropriate executive-level oversight for all the transformation activities to ensure programmes are adequately resourced and milestones achieved. Failure of our business performance to deliver cash as expected: access to funding markets or facilities being restricted: failures in operational liquidity and currency risk management: Tesco Bank cash call: or adverse changes to the pension deficit funding requirement: create calls on cash higher than anticipated, leading to impacts on financial performance, cash liquidity or the ability to continue to fund operations. We have a disciplined and policy-based approach to treasury management. We have reduced our debt levels and have improving debt metrics. We maintain an infrastructure of systems, policies and reports to ensure discipline and oversight on liquidity matters, including specific treasury and debt-related issues. Our treasury policies are communicated across the Group and are regularly reviewed by the Board, Executive Committee and management. The Group's funding strategy is approved annually by the Board and includes maintaining appropriate levels of working capital, undrawn committed facilities and access to the capital markets. The Audit Committee reviews and annually approves the viability and going concern statements and reports into the Board. There is a long-term funding framework in place for the pension deficit and there is ongoing communication and engagement with the Pension Trustees. Liquidity levels and sources of cash are regularly reviewed and the Group maintains access to committed credit facilities and debt capital markets. While recognising that Tesco Bank is financially separate from Tesco PLC, there is ongoing monitoring of the activities of Tesco Bank that could give rise to risks to Tesco PLC. Failure to deliver an effective, coherent and consistent strategy to respond to our competitors and changes in market conditions in the operating environment, resulting in a loss of market share and failure to improve profitability. We continue to face the ongoing challenge of a changing competitive landscape and price pressure across most of our markets. Our Board develops and regularly challenges the strategic direction of our business to enhance our ability to remain competitive on price, range and service. This activity includes development of our online channels and multiple formats to allow us to compete in different markets. Our Executive Committee and operational management regularly review markets, trading opportunities, competitor strategy and activity. We engage in market scanning and competitor analysis to refine our customer proposition. Indicates that the principal risk has been included as part of the longer term viability scenarios as detailed on page 37. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 33 Strategic report Principal risk Risk movement Key controls and mitigating factors Brand, reputation and trust. Failure to create brand reappraisal opportunities to improve quality, value and service perceptions thus failing to rebuild trust in our brand. We are leveraging the Tesco Centenary to celebrate 100 years of great value and reaffirm our position as the customer champion. We continue to implement a number of initiatives and activities, thereby helping reappraise the brand, increase trust and reputation, while improving our quality and value perception. Maintaining a differentiated brand is one of our strategic priorities. Our Group processes, policies and our Code of Business Conduct sets out how we can make the right decisions for our customers, colleagues, suppliers, communities and investors. We continue to develop communication and engagement programmes to listen to our customers and stakeholders and reflect their needs in our plans. This includes the Supplier Viewpoint and the integration of local community and local marketing programmes. We continue to maximise the value and impact of our brand with the advice of specialist external agencies and in-house marketing expertise. Our Corporate Responsibility Committee is in place to oversee all corporate responsibility activities and initiatives, ensuring alignment with customer priorities and our brand. Failure of our IT infrastructure or key IT systems result in loss of information, inability to operate effectively, financial or regulatory penalties, and negatively impacts our reputation. Further, failure to build resilience at the time of investing in and implementing new technology may result in potential loss of operating capability. Our dependency on technology continues to grow. Ongoing improvements and investment in disaster recovery and business continuity measures help to limit exposure to external threats. A multi-year programme is underway to enhance our technology infrastructure and resilience capabilities. This involves significant investment in our hosting strategy, partnering with cloud providers and re-engineering some of our legacy retail systems, while building redundancy for key business systems. Our technology security programme continues to build security capabilities to strengthen our infrastructure and Information Technology General Controls. Data security and data privacy. Failure to comply with legal or regulatory requirements relating to data security or data privacy in the course of our business activities, results in reputational damage, fines or other adverse consequences. This includes criminal penalties and consequential litigation which result in an adverse impact on our financial performance or unfavourable effects on our ability to do business. As a retail organisation we hold a large amount of customer and colleague personal data, and the threat landscape has been ever growing. The introduction of GDPR in May 2018 has meant an increase in individuals' awareness levels, as well as an increase in the financial penalties which can be levied by the data protection authorities. We put our customers and colleagues at the heart of all decisions we make in relation to the processing of personal data. Our multi-year technology security programme has been driving the enhancement of our security capabilities to improve data security. We have an established team to detect, report and respond to security incidents in a timely fashion. We have a third-party supplier assurance programme focusing on data security and privacy risks. We have made significant investment across the Group to ensure we comply with the requirements of GDPR in Europe, and any other relevant legislation globally. Our privacy compliance programme, which includes assessment and monitoring of risk, continues to drive compliance throughout our global business. There is regular reporting on progress of the security and privacy programmes to governance and oversight committees. Failure to comply with legal and other requirements as the regulatory environment becomes more restrictive, due to changes in the global political landscape, results in fines, criminal penalties for Tesco or colleagues, consequential litigation and an adverse impact on our reputation, financial results, and or our ability to do business. We continue to monitor and improve our controls to ensure we comply with legal and regulatory requirements across the Group. Long-term changes in the global political environment mean that in some markets there is a push towards greater regulation of foreign investors and a favouring of local companies. Wherever we operate, we aim to ensure that the impact of political and regulatory changes is incorporated in our strategic planning and policies. We manage regulatory risks through the use of our risk management framework and we have implemented compliance programmes and committees to manage our most important risks e. g. anti-bribery and competition law. Our compliance programmes ensure that sustainable controls are implemented to mitigate the risk and we conduct assurance activities for each risk area. Our Code of Business Conduct is supported by new starter and annual compliance training and other tools such as our whistleblowing hotline. The engagement of leadership and senior management is critical in the successful management of this risk area and leaders provide clear tone from the top for colleagues. Principal risks and uncertainties continued Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 34 Principal risk Risk movement Key controls and mitigating factors Health and safety. Failure to meet safety standards in relation to our workplace, resulting in death or injury to our customers, colleagues or third parties. We continue to focus our efforts on controls which ensure colleague and customer safety. We have a business-wide, risk-based safety framework which defines how we implement and report on safety controls to ensure that colleagues, contractors and customers have a safe place to work and shop. Each business is required to maintain a Safety Improvement Plan to document and track enhancements. Overall governance is provided by the Group Risk and Compliance Committee, with each business unit operating their own Health and Safety Committee. Our annual colleague survey results, alongside other inputs such as safety audits, informs the delivery of safety initiatives and targeted communications. Failure to attract and retain the required capability and continue to evolve our culture could impact delivery of our purpose and strategic drivers. Market competitiveness continues to affect our ability to attract and retain key specialist talent. There is continued impact arising from fast-changing and complex legislation. Talent planning and people development processes are well established across the Group. Talent and succession planning is discussed annually by the Board and three times a year at the Executive Committee and Nominations and Governance Committee. A Group Inclusion strategy is in place. An independent assessment of all promotions and external hires is conducted at leadership level to ensure capability, potential, leadership and values. The Remuneration Committee agrees objectives and remuneration arrangements for senior management. People risk mitigation plans are in place throughout the Group, supported by the Executive Committee. Responsible sourcing and supply chain. Failure to meet product safety standards resulting in death, injury or illness to customers. Failure to ensure that products are sourced responsibly and sustainably across supply chains including fair pay for workers, adhering to human rights, clean and safe working environments, and that all social and environmental standards are met, leading to breaches of regulations, illness, injury or death to workers and communities, and affecting our reputation. We continue to monitor and improve our controls to further reduce this risk. We have product standards, policies and guidance covering both food and non-food, as well as goods and services not for resale, ensuring that products are safe, legal and of the required quality. Measures include policies and guidance to help to ensure that the human rights of workers are respected and environmental impacts are managed responsibly. Refer to pages 24 to 31 for specific actions highlighted under our Little Helps Plan. Supplier audit programmes are in place to monitor product safety, traceability and integrity, human rights and environmental standards, including unannounced specification inspections of suppliers and facilities. We run colleague training programmes on food and product safety, responsible sourcing, hygiene controls, and also provide support for stores. We also provide targeted training for colleagues and suppliers dealing with specific challenges such as modern slavery. Booker synergy realisation and integration. Failure to successfully integrate Booker is dependent on a number of factors, leading to a risk to our planned synergy commitments and value creation. There has been good progress on the expected synergies. A detailed synergy realisation and integration plan was successfully executed during the financial year. Period-end reporting and tracking of targeted benefits and key performance indicators is embedded. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 35 Strategic report Principal risk Risk movement Key controls and mitigating factors Brexit. Failure to prepare for the UK's departure from the EU will cause disruption to and create uncertainty around our business, not least our ability to recruit and supply to our customers. Any disruption or uncertainty could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. Uncertainty around our departure from the EU has continued to grow as a result of the political deadlock. With the UK's future trading relationship with the EU still to be determined, we continue to contribute to important public policy discussion and engage with government, regulatory bodies and industry. During this process, we will continue to assess and monitor the potential risks and impacts on Tesco customers, colleagues and shareholders, while taking appropriate mitigation measures to address challenges including logistics, staff and supply. This year we put in place a detailed Brexit contingency plan against political and macro-economic changes that could have a material impact on our market and customer proposition. Tesco Bank is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are operational risk, regulatory risk, credit risk, funding and liquidity risk, market risk and business risk. The Bank continues to actively manage the risks to which it is exposed. The Bank has a defined risk appetite, which is approved and reviewed regularly by both the Bank's Board and the Tesco PLC Board. The risk appetite defines the type and amount of risk that the Group is prepared to accept to achieve its objectives, and forms a key link between the day-to-day risk management of the business and its strategic priorities, long-term plan, capital planning and liquidity management. Adherence to risk appetite is monitored through a series of ratios and limits. The Bank operates a risk management framework that is underpinned by governance, policies, processes and controls, reporting, assurance and stress testing. There is Bank Board risk reporting throughout the year, with updates to the Tesco PLC Audit Committee by the Bank's Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer and Audit Committee Chairman.

The complex global challenges and uncertainties related to climate change and resource scarcity affect our business and our ambition of providing affordable, healthy and sustainable food. Our approach to these uncertainties is to work collaboratively to tackle both the risks and opportunities. Our Little Helps Plan integrates a number of initiatives across our business to manage some of these risks. Further details are included in the Little Helps Plan section on pages 24 to 31. Tesco has publicly committed to implementing the recommendations June 2017 of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD. As part of our ongoing TCFD assessment, we are using scenario analysis and looking at both short-term and long-term climate risks and opportunities for our UK business. Refer to page 177 for more detailed disclosures on TCFD. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019 36 Longer term viability statement. Assessing the Group's longer term prospects and viability. The Directors have based their assessment of viability on the Group's current strategic plan, which is updated and approved annually by the Board and delivers the Group's purpose of 'serving shoppers a little better every day' underpinned by the six strategic drivers detailed on pages 14 and 15. The Group conducts an annual strategic planning process, comprising a comprehensive reassessment of progress against the Group's strategic objectives alongside a careful evaluation of the longer term opportunities and risks in each market in which the Group operates. The process for assessing the principal and emerging risks in each market is an important input to this process. The Group's Strategic Planning and Viability Statement are both considered over a three-year period, as this horizon most appropriately reflects the dynamic and changing retail environment in which the Group operates. The strategic planning process builds from the Group's current position and considers the evolution of the strategic objectives over the next three years. As part of this process, a longer-term assessment of the prospects of the Group is also considered. Significant progress has been made by the Group against the strategic objectives announced in October 2016, including: - Broad-based progress made in key customer, supplier and colleague metrics: - Strong profit growth and free cash generation reflect the Group's focus on delivering cost savings and profitable sales growth: - A clear strategy focusing on customer satisfaction, cash profitability, free cash flow and earnings growth: - Synergies realised from the Booker merger completed in March 2018 are tracking ahead of plan: and - The Group has operations across a diversified set of geographies and business areas Retail, Banking and Customer Data Science. Refer to the Group Chief Executive's review on page 3 and the financial review on page 18 for further detail regarding the Group's strategic and financial progress. The following factors are considered both in the formulation of the Group's Strategic Plan, and in the longer term assessment of the Group's prospects: - The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, as well as emerging risks as they are identified, and how these can be addressed: - The prevailing economic climate and global economy, competitor activity, market dynamics and changing customer behaviours: - The potential short and longer term economic impact of Brexit: - The structural challenges facing retail and how the Group can best position itself to address these: - The value opportunities presented by further cost reduction through operational simplification and untapped growth potential across the Group: and - The resilience afforded by the Group's operational scale. Assessing the Group's viability. The viability of the Company has been assessed, taking into account the Company's current financial position, including external funding in place over the assessment period, and after modelling the impact of certain scenarios arising from the principal risks, which have the greatest potential impact on viability in that period. Four scenarios have been modelled, considered severe but plausible, that encompass these identified risks. None of these scenarios individually threaten the viability of the Company, therefore the compound impact of these scenarios has been evaluated as the most severe stress scenario. Scenario Associated principal risks Description Competitive pressure - Brand, reputation and trust - Competition and markets - Customer Failure to respond to fierce competition and changes in the retail market drives sustained significant like-for-like volume decline in core food categories with no offsetting price inflation, putting pressure on margins. Data security or regulatory breach - Brand, reputation and trust - Data security and data privacy - Political, regulatory and compliance A serious data security or regulatory breach results in a significant monetary penalty and a loss of reputation among customers. The modelling of this scenario is approached through a 'reverse-stress test' given the inherent uncertainty of value. Brexit impact - Competition and markets - Political, regulatory and compliance - Brexit Assumes a no-deal Brexit scenario which results in an increase to cost of goods and overhead costs. A broad assessment of the potential impact has been modelled including: higher import tariffs, higher sourcing costs from a weaker sterling, higher labour costs and the potential cost of customs friction from border controls. Appropriate mitigation options open to the Group have also been considered within this scenario. Reduction in cost savings and cash generation - Transformation - Liquidity Failure to achieve the Group's transformation objectives, resulting in an inability to progress sufficiently quickly to maintain or increase operating margin and generate sufficient cash to meet business objectives. These scenarios assumed that external debt is repaid as it becomes due and committed facilities renewed as they become due. The scenarios above are hypothetical and purposefully severe with the aim of creating outcomes that have the ability to threaten the viability of the Group. In the case of these scenarios arising, various options are available to the Group in order to maintain liquidity so as to continue in operation such as: i accessing new external funding early: ii more radical short-term cost reduction actions: and iii reducing capital expenditure. None of these actions are assumed in our current scenario modelling. Based on these severe but plausible scenarios, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period considered. This Strategic report, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, has been approved and signed on behalf of the Board.

      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE": "- The **Return on Equity (ROE)** decreased from approximately **8.9%** in the previous year to about **7.3%** in the current year, indicating a **deterioration** in the company\u2019s ability to generate profits from shareholders\u2019 equity.  \n- Despite strong underlying operational performance, including a **13.5% increase in group operating profit before exceptional items** and improved **retail free cash flow**, the ROE decline suggests that **net income growth did not keep pace with equity growth** or was impacted by other factors.  \n- The company reported a drop in **statutory profit before tax** by 18.7%, and **statutory diluted EPS** declined by 26.8%, reflecting the impact of **exceptional items**, amortisation, and **net pension finance costs** on net earnings, which weigh on ROE.  \n- **Exceptional charges** totaling \u00a3375 million, including restructuring costs and impairment charges, likely suppressed net income, thus reducing ROE.  \n- The **increase in total equity** due to retained earnings and pension deficit contributions diluted ROE despite improved cash flows and operating profit.  \n- The company\u2019s **net debt decreased** and liquidity improved, enhancing financial stability but potentially increasing equity base and lowering ROE.  \n- The **ongoing COVID-19 pandemic** is expected to introduce additional costs and operational challenges, which may put short-term pressure on profitability and thus ROE in the next quarter.  \n- However, management\u2019s focus on **cost savings, operational simplification, and strategic divestments** (e.g., sale of Thailand and Malaysia businesses) supports a potential rebound in profitability and ROE over the next year.  \n- The **proposed special dividend** and pension deficit contributions signal a strong commitment to shareholder returns, despite near-term ROE pressure.  \n- Overall, the current ROE trend reflects transitional challenges; recovery and improvement are plausible if operational efficiencies and market conditions stabilize.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE Driver": "- The company\u2019s **Assets Turnover** has slightly decreased from **5.08 to 5.03**, indicating a marginal decline in efficiency in using assets to generate sales.\n- The **Profit Margin** has notably declined from **2.07% to 1.50%**, reflecting a weakening in the company\u2019s ability to convert sales into net profits.\n- Both ratios are key drivers of **Return on Equity (ROE)**, with the decrease in profit margin having a more pronounced negative impact.\n- The decline in **profitability** suggests increased costs or pricing pressures, possibly linked to intensified competition and operational disruptions highlighted in the report.\n- The small reduction in **asset turnover** may reflect strategic changes such as store resizing, transformation in Central Europe, and investments in new formats like urban fulfillment centers.\n- The annual report notes **strong sales growth in UK & ROI and Asia**, but this is offset by challenges in Central Europe, explaining the mixed trends in asset utilization.\n- Investor value creation is challenged due to the **weaker profit margins**, which undermine earnings despite relatively stable asset efficiency.\n- The report\u2019s emphasis on ongoing transformation and cost-saving initiatives indicates management\u2019s focus on improving **operating margin** and **asset productivity** going forward.\n- Short-term outlook suggests potential margin pressure from **COVID-19 related costs**, though this may be partly offset by increased food volumes and government reliefs.\n- Over the next year, expected improvements in **asset efficiency** and **profitability** are tied to execution of strategic plans, cost synergies, and the proposed sale of non-core businesses.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of Risk": "- The company's **gearing ratio increased** significantly from 1.77 to 2.48, indicating a higher proportion of debt relative to equity, which raises its financial leverage and potential solvency risk.  \n- Both the **current ratio** and **quick ratio improved**, moving from 0.61 to 0.72 and 0.17 to 0.26 respectively, suggesting enhanced short-term liquidity and a better ability to cover current liabilities, although still below 1, indicating some liquidity constraints remain.  \n- The **NLP financial risk score decreased** from 1.66 to 1.18, showing a reduction in perceived financial risk based on textual disclosures, which is a positive signal for investors.  \n- Similarly, both **NLP legal and tax risks declined sharply**, from 1.07 to 0.48 and 1.07 to 0.66 respectively, indicating these risk areas are less emphasized or potentially better managed in the current period.  \n- The **NLP specificity improved slightly** from 0.092 to 0.094, indicating marginally clearer and more precise risk disclosures, enhancing transparency.  \n- However, the **average sentence length increased** from about 24.8 to 26.5 words, and **sentence depth rose** from 6.19 to 6.57, signaling more complex language and possibly more detailed but potentially harder to digest disclosures.  \n- The increased complexity could challenge some investors but may also reflect more nuanced risk discussion, balancing transparency and sophistication.  \n- Overall, the **perceived risk profile has decreased**, especially regarding financial, legal, and tax risks, despite increased financial leverage.  \n- The improved liquidity ratios and clearer disclosures suggest the company is strengthening its short-term resilience and communication with stakeholders.  \n- Going forward, risks related to **gearing and liquidity** may require monitoring as elevated debt levels could amplify vulnerabilities if economic conditions deteriorate, but current reporting improvements signal proactive risk management.",
      "summary": "- The company\u2019s **Return on Equity (ROE)** declined from **8.9% to 7.3%**, reflecting decreased profitability relative to shareholders\u2019 equity despite a **13.5% rise in operating profit**.  \n- **Net income** was pressured by **exceptional charges (\u00a3375 million)**, amortisation, and **pension finance costs**, contributing to lower **statutory profit before tax** and **diluted EPS**.  \n- The increase in **total equity** and reduced **net debt** improved financial stability but diluted ROE.  \n- **Profit margin** dropped significantly from **2.07% to 1.50%**, while **asset turnover** slightly fell, indicating weaker earnings conversion and marginally reduced asset efficiency.  \n- The company faces **margin pressure** from ongoing **COVID-19 related costs** and operational challenges, partially offset by strong sales growth in some regions and government reliefs.  \n- **Gearing ratio** increased from **1.77 to 2.48**, raising financial leverage risk, although **liquidity improved** with current and quick ratios rising, signaling better short-term resilience.  \n- **NLP risk scores** for financial, legal, and tax areas declined, showing reduced perceived risk and improved risk management.  \n- Enhanced **reporting quality** with clearer disclosures boosts transparency, despite increased complexity in language and sentence structure.  \n- Management\u2019s focus on **cost savings**, **operational simplification**, and **strategic divestments** points to potential ROE recovery and profitability improvement over the next year.  \n- The proposed **special dividend** and pension contributions demonstrate commitment to shareholder value amid transitional challenges."

This transaction, supported unanimously by the Board, will unlock significant value from an exceptionally high-quality business, and allows us to further simplify and focus the Group. On completion, and subject to approval, we have taken the decision to return c. PS5bn of the proceeds to shareholders through a special dividend. In October 2019, we shared the news that Dave will leave the business later this year. The Board and I believe that Dave has done an outstanding job in turning the business around and reconnecting Tesco to its core purpose. The Board undertook a thorough succession process to find the best possible candidate and, as a result, we made the decision to appoint Ken Murphy to take up the baton from Dave. Ken will bring to Tesco a wealth of experience, proven leadership in international retail businesses, a strong strategic mind and a track record in commercial and brand. What was very important to the Board in the recruitment process was that the new CEO would be a good fit for the strong culture that we have developed. On behalf of the whole Board, I am extremely grateful to Dave for everything that he has achieved, and we look forward to welcoming Ken Murphy to the Board, and to Tesco, in October. John Allan Non-executive Chairman 7 April 2020 Chairman's statement A year of significant progress. This report covers our 2019 20 financial year, which ended on 29 February 2020. That year was one of significant progress, as we achieved our turnaround goals, further improved our business for customers, and firmly established ourselves on a strong financial footing. However, while the entire Tesco business has dealt with some serious challenges through the last five years of turnaround, undoubtedly the most significant of these occurred after our 2019 20 year end, with the global outbreak of COVID-19. As Dave reflects in his Group Chief Executive's review, our more than 400,000 colleagues have risen to the challenge incredibly, working day and night to ensure our customers have access to the food and essentials they need, in a safe environment. I cannot commend them highly enough for their efforts, which have been nothing short of inspirational. The remainder of this report addresses, for the most part, the 2019 20 financial year - before the greatest impact of the significant changes that COVID-19 brought to our business, and indeed our society as a whole. Our priority is to keep an absolute focus on serving customers and to play our part in feeding the nation, as the situation with COVID-19 continues to dominate our current trading following the year end. Given these circumstances, we have included commentary on COVID-19 in this report where possible, while recognising that, at the time of writing, the situation is rapidly evolving. For the latest updates on our response to the COVID-19 outbreak, I would encourage you to visit www. In 2019 20, we marked the end of our turnaround. The management team set in 2015 and shared in 2016 a strategy to stabilise the business, to rebuild the brand, and to move towards the next chapter of growth. Guided by six strategic drivers, the whole Tesco team worked tirelessly to achieve these objectives and by October 2019, we had achieved every one of our turnaround goals. That momentum continued through this year, with full-year Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles up 13.5% to PS2,959m. We now have a strong platform from which we can enter a new strategic phase, focused around earnings growth, cash profitability and cash flow, and with customer satisfaction at the heart. In June 2019, we hosted a Capital Markets day, which set out untapped value opportunities for the Group, broadly categorised across three areas: growth, innovation and enabling technology. - Significant progress in the financial year ended 29 February 2020, as we marked the completion of our turnaround. - Announced the proposed sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia will release material value, and allow us to simplify and focus our business. - Appointed a new Group Chief Executive, Ken Murphy, to succeed Dave Lewis in October 2020. 2 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 - Other parts of our business are stepping up too. Booker is supporting thousands of independent retailers in communities right across the UK, and Tesco Bank is providing critical services at a time of financial difficulty for many customers. It is impossible to present an exhaustive list, or to overstate how much has changed - and the extraordinary lengths the whole Tesco team has gone to - in order to look after our customers. Recognising the incredible contribution of our colleagues, in March we announced a 10% bonus for front-line colleagues in the UK & Ireland, with similar colleague recognition schemes in Central Europe and Asia. The contribution of our supplier partners has also been outstanding. Existing supplier partners have increased production of key products to meet increased demand from customers, and new suppliers have stepped up to support at short notice. We also know that for many of our partners, and in particular our smallest suppliers, this is a challenging time economically. To support their businesses, we have reduced our payment terms for small suppliers from 14 days to five days. These actions are the right ones to take, in a unique and difficult set of circumstances. Some of the things we'five done have resulted in significant extra costs, as we meet unprecedented levels of demand and do everything possible to protect the health and safety of our customers and colleagues. Our financial performance, and the strong platform we have built over the last five years, means that we are well-placed to deal with this and to continue meeting customers' needs, and gives us confidence that the long-term future of our business is secure. As a team, Tesco has faced into many challenges over the last five years and we will rise to the challenges of the current situation in much the same way, working together to put customers first. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive 7 April 2020 Group Chief Executive's review Together, we can do this. - Five years of turnaround now complete - built a better business for customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders. - Strong foundations allow us to tackle the challenges of COVID-19 from a position of strength. In our five years of turnaround, we have taken decisive action to refocus our business on customers, making our offer more relevant and more competitive than ever before. By focusing completely on customers, re-engaging our colleagues and fundamentally rethinking our relationship with suppliers, we have managed to deliver on the turnaround plan we set out in 2015. I am very proud of the achievement of the team over these five years. As a stronger, more customer-focused business, we are also in a better position to step up and meet the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our colleagues have risen brilliantly to those challenges. In very difficult circumstances the whole Tesco team has pulled together to look after our customers and each other, doing everything possible to provide more of the food that people need, in a clean and safe environment. I am incredibly proud of what our colleagues are doing, and also the way that they're doing it - working day and night to ensure everyone has access to the essentials, and putting our customers first, even while many of our colleagues have very real concerns about their own loved ones. At the time of writing, it seems likely that we are closer to the beginning of this situation than the end. While we are still learning and adjusting, we will step up and respond to each new challenge as it comes. And at all times, our focus will be the same: to ensure the health and safety of our customers and colleagues, to increase food and household supplies across stores and online, and to support our fantastic colleagues. There is almost no part of our operation that remains untouched by this situation. - To ensure food is available for all, we have changed the way we run our stores - taking actions to manage demand and support the smooth running of our supply chain. - Our Online team is exploring every opportunity possible to increase capacity, so that we can help the most vulnerable in society. For the majority of our customers that are able to shop in store safely, we have introduced distancing measures to protect customers and colleagues. - We have taken steps to support colleagues on sickness leave and also provided long-term sickness support for those required to isolate for 12 weeks. We also recruited more than 45,000 additional colleagues in the two weeks to 7 April. - We have announced a PS30m support package for local communities tackling COVID-19, including PS25m towards our food donation programme. 3 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Strategic report 14 15 19 20 Change Customer NPS a 10 29 19 pts Brand perception b 6.8 26.1 19.3 pts Quality perception c 12.2 27.4 15.2 pts Value perception c 6.1 21.0 14.9 pts Key performance for all four stakeholder groups summarised below.

We have now delivered every element of our turnaround plan. From this position of strength, the transformation of our business continues at pace. 4 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 In June 2019, we held a Capital Markets day to share 'untapped value opportunities' across the Group. Some of these opportunities are well-advanced in their execution, while others are at early stages of consideration. Areas of progress this year include: Growth. New store openings We have done extensive work to improve the model of our Express format, reducing the capital and the operational costs, while improving the mix. We have identified opportunities to open 150 new Express stores in the UK over the next three years. Urban fulfilment centres We have plans to open at least 25 urban fulfilment centres in the UK, as part of a plan to double the capacity of our online grocery business. These centres make use of existing surplus space in large stores, with a more efficient, automated system in a small footprint. Clubcard Plus We launched Clubcard in 1995 to help us better understand and communicate with our customers, and today there are 19 million households in the UK with Clubcard. At the end of 2019, we launched the UK's first grocery loyalty subscription service, Clubcard Plus, giving customers even more value from their Tesco shop, including 10% off two big shops in-store each month. A new Clubcard New ways to shop From multipacks to multibuys Innovation. Simplify to serve As customer shopping habits continue to change, we are adapting the way we run our stores - improving customer service, and reducing our operating costs. In the UK, we have rolled out a new proposition for fresh food counters and in February we announced changes to the way we bake in our large stores, to better reflect customer demands. Plant-based food We have a market-leading range of plant-based foods, catering to a growing trend of veganism and flexitarian diets. In September 2019 we launched our new 'Plant Chef' range, and we continue to expand this - for example with the launch of the UK's first plant-based condiment range in January. Plastic packaging Our packaging strategy is based on '4 Rs': - Remove it where we can. This year, we committed to remove one billion pieces of plastic from our UK stores by the end of 2020, and are working with our suppliers to remove 67 million pieces of multipack plastic from cans in our stores, saving 350 tonnes of plastic each year. Simpler for colleagues All our large stores are using a new scheduler tool, providing greater flexibility and choice for colleagues. This simple technology enables us to reduce administration, making it simpler for colleagues to book and amend shifts, and feedback has been extremely positive. co. uk relaunch Booker already has a significant digital business, serving many thousands of customers online. These Booker customers will now benefit from the technology capability of Tesco, following a relaunch of Booker. There have already been improvements to web analytics and invoicing, making the order process simpler for Booker customers. A seamless store experience Different technologies work for different customers, so we will continue to offer a choice of ways to shop and pay. One area we are exploring is the use of new technology to make shopping 'frictionless': where items are automatically added to a digital shopping basket as customers pick them up from the shelf. We are testing this technology with colleagues in the Express store at our Welwyn Garden City campus. 5 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Strategic report We use our expertise to understand and meet our customers' needs better than anybody else.

To aid comparability, headline results and associated commentary is presented on a 52-week comparable basis. We have delivered a strong performance, significantly growing profitability and free cash flow. Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles of PS2,959m grew by 13.5%. Strong performance in our UK & ROI and Asia segments was partly offset by the impact of disruption as we transform our business in Central Europe to improve long-term profitability in the region. Retail free cash flow increased by PS1,174m year-on-year to PS2,063m, reflecting the strong increase in cash profitability, an improvement in working capital and the contribution from the sale of our share in our joint venture in China, Gain Land. Reflecting the strength of our performance last year and given our robust liquidity and balance sheet, we propose to pay a final dividend of 6.50 pence per ordinary share. This takes the total dividend for the year to 9.15 pence per ordinary share, up 58.6% year-on-year, including the payment of an interim dividend of 2.65 pence per ordinary share in November 2019. This represents a full-year dividend payout ratio of 50% on a 53-week basis. In March we announced that we had agreed to sell our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia to a combination of CP Group entities g, following inbound interest and a detailed strategic review. Consideration for the disposal represents an enterprise value of $10.6bn c. PS8.2bn on a cash and debt-free basis. Following completion of the disposal, we intend to return c. PS5bn to shareholders via a special dividend and further fide-risk the business by reducing indebtedness through a PS2.5bn pension contribution, which is expected to eliminate the funding deficit. a Last year figures restated for the adoption of IFRS 16 as explained in Note 1 and Note 37 to the Group financial statements. b Group sales exclude VAT and fuel. Sales growth shown on a comparable days basis for Central Europe and Asia. Booker consolidated from 5 March 2018 and therefore includes nine additional days in 2019 20 vs. 2018 19. The nine additional days of Booker sales in the current year contributed 0.2% to Group sales growth in the year. c Excludes amortisation of acquired intangibles and excludes exceptional items by virtue of their size and nature in order to reflect management's view of underlying performance. d Net debt and Retail free cash flow exclude the impact of Tesco Bank in order to provide further analysis of the Retail cash flow statement. Net debt also includes lease liabilities following the adoption of IFRS 16. Net debt excluding lease liabilities was PS 2.6 bn, down PS0.2bn year-on-year. e Headline 'diluted earnings per share' and 'adjusted Group profit before tax' measures exclude exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments. f Capex is shown excluding property buybacks. Statutory capital expenditure including property buybacks for the 53 weeks ended 29 February 2020 was PS2.1bn 2018 19: PS1.2bn. g On 9 March 2020 we announced the proposed sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia to a combination of CP Group entities. Completion of the disposal, which is conditional on shareholder approval and customary regulatory approvals in Thailand and Malaysia, is expected during the second half of 2020. Thailand and Malaysia will be treated as discontinued operations for the 2020 21 financial year. All guidance and forward-looking statements are on a continuing operations basis. 7 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Strategic report Financial review continued Segmental results. UK & ROI a In the UK, we continued our centenary celebrations offering significant savings to customers through our '100 Years of Great Value' events, and introduced exclusive Clubcard Prices for our 19 million Clubcard holders. We have further strengthened our value proposition with the launch of our 'Aldi Price Match campaign' in March 2020, price matching to Aldi on hundreds of Tesco and branded products. The customer reaction to the launch of Clubcard Plus in November has been encouraging. For a PS7.99 monthly subscription, customers can benefit from 10% off two big shops in-store as well as savings on popular Tesco brands and double data on Tesco Mobile. Subscribers can also apply for a Clubcard Plus credit card from Tesco Bank with no foreign exchange fees abroad b. Our fresh food volumes outperformed the market by 0.5% c supported by strong performance in our 'food-to-go' offer. We continue to improve our overall product mix, making our general merchandise offer more relevant by focusing on categories that are complementary to our food offer such as Home and Cook. In the coming year we are planning to rebalance space further, in particular by augmenting our F&F clothing offer in a number of our large stores. Our online grocery customer service ratings all improved year-on-year. Following a strong sales performance in the first half, a slower rate of growth in the second half of the year reflected our decision to maintain a sustainable approach to incentivising new customers in a highly competitive environment. We are taking steps to increase our online capacity to align to the long-term growth in customer demand in this channel, with our first urban fulfilment centre planned in our West Bromwich Extra store. This year we will also increase the number of vans and trial unmanned Click & Collect sites to further support order growth. In November we announced we will become the first UK retailer to remove plastic-wrapped tinned multipacks from all stores and replace them with plastic-free multibuys, eliminating 67 million pieces of plastic. This forms part of our commitment to remove one billion pieces of plastic from our UK stores by the end of 2020. Booker sales grew on a comparable days basis by 3.8% excluding tobacco 2.9% including tobacco despite a challenging market in both wholesale and retail, with small business confidence remaining low. The continued focus on customer service was recognised in November when Booker was named 'Best National Wholesaler' for overall customer satisfaction d. The acquisition of Best Food Logistics in early March 2020 will provide more customers with the benefits of the sourcing capabilities of the wider Tesco business. In ROI, sales grew by 0.8% at constant exchange rates, and we saw particularly strong sales growth in core fresh food, including bakery and produce, as customers responded well to the continued investment in our 'You won't pay more' value campaign. UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles grew by 16.9% at actual exchange rates to PS2,184m, with operating margin up 59 basis points year-on-year. The increase in profitability was driven by the actions we have taken to improve product mix, and cost savings through further refinements to our operating model including changes to our in-store counters offer and simplification of stock control processes. We have now delivered cumulative synergies comprising the in-year benefit of new initiatives combined with the carry forward of prior year activity of PS207m from the Booker merger, exceeding our c. PS200m target a year earlier than planned. While we still see many opportunities to deliver further synergies, these will no longer be considered separately to our overall UK & ROI performance. In the period, the challenge of a weak market in both the wholesale and catering sectors was exacerbated by the effect of the clearance of excess stock that had been built up in anticipation of Brexit disruption. Despite these challenges Booker's profit growth including synergies outperformed the industry as a whole. Central Europe e In Central Europe, we have undertaken a significant transformation, fundamentally changing our approach in Poland and resizing, simplifying and improving the relevance of our businesses in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. Sales fell by 10.1 % at constant exchange rates, reflecting disruption from the actions we have taken including the rationalisation of our general merchandise offer, making our customer offer more relevant and compelling. Across the region we rightsized 545 hypermarkets, closed 28 stores and, in Poland, completed the transition to a two-format model compact hypermarkets and supermarkets. We also invested to improve the shopping trip for customers, focusing on availability which improved by 1% and our key 'Star Lines' products which saw like-for-like growth of 20%. Operating profit before exceptional items in Central Europe was PS156m, 29.4 % lower year-on-year. The actions described above to simplify our operations resulted in significant sales disruption and stock clearance costs, particularly in the second half of the year. In addition, performance reflected investments to improve the competitiveness of our offer, in particular our key 'Star Lines' products, over 600 everyday items which we have made available to customers at market-leading prices. Excluding a PS 13 m provision made in the first half in respect of potential historical VAT liabilities, the change in operating profit was 23.5 %. Asia f In Asia, sales grew by 6.7% at actual exchange rates and by 0.1% at constant exchange rates. In Thailand, our new Express proposition roll out and large store reinvention programme are both progressing well and as part of our innovation in store formats we now have two of our 'ultra convenient' E-Pop stores in the Bangkok region. We have simplified our fresh food offer, with more competitive prices and our 'Food Love Stories' campaign has further improved customer quality perceptions. The simplification of our general merchandise ranges impacted our headline sales by c. 1 % in the year. In Malaysia, we increased our market share, opening two new small stores following favourable legislation changes, with plans for a further four openings in 2020 21. Across the region we are building trust with customers through our focus on reducing food waste and plastic usage. We saw a strong increase in profitability in Asia, with growth of 33.5% at actual exchange rates and 24.8% at constant exchange rates. We accelerated our cost savings initiatives in Thailand, including a more efficient distribution operation and more focused, more effective marketing activity. In addition, we benefited from the flow through of prior year initiatives. We continued to optimise the mix of our product ranges as we focus on sustainable, profitable ranges in general merchandise. Performance also included a PS24m benefit as a result of changes to how property tax is levied on businesses in Thailand. In 2020 21, our Asia operations will be treated as a discontinued operation following the announcement on 9 March 2020 of the proposed sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia g. Tesco Bank This year Last year YoY Revenue PS1,068m PS1,097m 2.6 % Operating profit before exceptional items PS193m PS199m 3.0 % Statutory operating profit PS74m PS169m 56.2 % Lending to customers PS8,451m PS12,426m 32.0 % Customer deposits PS7,707m PS10,465m 26.4 % Net interest margin 4.1% 3.8% 0.3% Total capital ratio 23.1% 18.3% 4.8% Tesco Bank focuses on providing simple banking and insurance products to a broad range of Tesco customers. Tesco Bank sales were impacted by our decision to exit the mortgage market in September, which also drove the decline in lending to customers. The insurance market remains highly competitive and we continue to focus our investment on retention of existing customers. This year we have also invested in the customer experience through a number of initiatives, including the launch of the Clubcard Plus credit card, and a new Student Shopper a UK & ROI consists of Tesco UK, ROI and Booker.

In addition, we upgraded the Tesco Mobile app to allow customers to purchase foreign currency and we rolled out our Click & Collect service to more stores. Operating profit before exceptional items decreased by 3.0 % year-on-year to PS193m. Our insurance income decreased as we focused on competitive pricing, however we delivered increased income from our loans portfolio in line with increased lending to customers, and higher income from our gift cards and travel money. The significant cost savings made this year include lower fraud costs resulting from the Bank's continued focus on improved technology and safeguarding our customers, and lower ATM maintenance costs as a result of optimisation efficiencies. This has contributed to the cost:income ratio improving by 1.9% pts year-on-year. In February we stopped accepting new applications for personal current accounts, as part of our repositioning of Tesco Bank to focus on the right products and services for Tesco customers. This resulted in an exceptional charge of PS 56 m relating to accelerated depreciation of intangible and fixed assets. Total exceptional items within statutory operating profit relating to Tesco Bank were PS 119 m. Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles in statutory operating profit.

This year, total exceptional items resulted in a net cost of PS 375 m, compared to a net credit of PS120m in the prior year. This year-on-year movement is principally due to provision releases and net impairment reversals in the base, as well as the accounting impact of obtaining full control of one of our property joint ventures The Tesco Atrato Limited Partnership through the acquisition of our partner's 50% stake in September 2019. All of these significant movements are non-cash. Exceptional restructuring and redundancy costs of PS 107 m include a PS 51 m charge relating to the simplification of our store operating model in the UK and a PS 43 m charge relating to the transformation we have undertaken in Central Europe. Exceptional net profits on property transactions of PS44m have arisen from property disposals within the UK PS18m and Central Europe PS26m. We have incurred a PS 23 m exceptional charge relating to Booker integration costs, bringing costs to date to PS 38 m. The acquisition of our partner's stake in The Tesco Atrato Limited Partnership results in the Group taking on the joint venture's external debt in addition to its freehold assets 15 stores and two distribution centres. The exceptional charge of PS 136 m represents the net effect of the derecognition of the previously held IFRS 16 lease liabilities and right of use assets, and the impairment of the acquired assets. As announced at the half year, the impairment charge of PS 47 m relating to our Trent Hypermarket joint venture relates to reduced profit expectations due to investments in the competitiveness of our offer and reduced store expansion plans. Other exceptional items include a profit of PS37m on the disposal of our 20% share in Gain Land in China, and a PS 22 m charge relating to corporate activity, which includes costs relating to the proposed sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia in addition to other Group projects. Tesco Bank recognised a PS 56 m exceptional accelerated depreciation charge following the decision to close our current account business to new customers. Also, as announced at the half year, Tesco Bank recognised an additional PS 45 m provision for customer redress due to an unexpectedly high number of claims received in the weeks prior to the 29 August deadline in respect of Payment Protection Insurance PPI. Net exceptional items of PS 33 m in week 53 comprise a PS 44 m charge relating to further changes to our UK store operating model and PS11m of net profits on property transactions in the UK. Amortisation of acquired intangible assets is also excluded from our headline performance measures. The PS 78 m charge primarily relates to our merger with Booker in March 2018, which resulted in the recognition of goodwill of PS3,093m and a PS755m intangible asset. Our share of post-tax profits from joint ventures and associates before exceptional items was PS26m, an increase of PS5m year-on-year primarily due to a reduced level of losses from Gain Land, our former associate in China. Exceptional items of PS 8 m comprise a PS 12 m charge for land penalties arising in our 20% share of Gain Land, and in Tesco Bank, an exceptional gain of PS4m in our insurance joint venture, Tesco Underwriting, reflecting a revision to the Ogden compensation tables which are used to calculate future losses in personal injury and fatal accident claims. Following the sale of our 20% share in Gain Land and proposed sale of our business in Thailand, which is inclusive of our 25% share of the Tesco Lotus Retail Growth Freehold and Leasehold Property Fund TLGF, our share of post-tax profits from joint ventures and associates will primarily relate to our UK property joint ventures. In 2019 20 TLGF contributed PS26m to profit.

Total indebtedness was PS 14,674 m, down PS868m year-on-year driven by a reduction in our lease liabilities and underlying net debt, partly offset by an increase in the pension deficit. Our lease liabilities decreased by PS943m year-on-year, principally reflecting the purchase of our partner's 50% stake in the Tesco Atrato Limited property joint venture. The acquisition, which is treated as an asset acquisition, increases our freehold property ownership and borrowings, replacing associated right of use assets and lease liabilities. In addition, our lease liabilities reduced due to capital repayments made in the year and the buyback of a number of other leasehold properties. On an IAS 19 basis, our pension deficit increased by PS 235 m to PS 2.6 bn. An increase in the measurement of scheme liabilities due to a fall in corporate bond yields was largely offset by strong asset performance, including that of our liability-driven investment portfolio, in addition to continued deficit contributions and the application of the latest actuarial assumptions. As part of the use of proceeds from the proposed sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, we have reached agreement with the Trustees to make a PS2.5bn one-off contribution into the Scheme. This, along with other measures, is expected to eliminate the funding deficit and significantly reduce the prospect of having to make further pension deficit contributions in the future. The agreement with the Trustees also covers the key principles of the triennial scheme valuation, which will now be calculated as at 31 December 2019. The Trustees will aim to conclude the valuation as soon as is reasonably possible. Our key credit metrics, which are Fixed charge cover and Total indebtedness EBITDA, have further improved since the end of the last financial year, from 3.0 to 3.4 times and from 3.6 to 3.1 times respectively. We are now targeting leverage of c. 2.5 times. Retail free cash flow increased by PS1,174m year-on-year to PS2,063m, reflecting a strong increase in cash profitability, a decrease in working capital and the contribution from the sale of our share in Gain Land. We generated a net working capital inflow of PS163m. This improvement is lower than initially planned, and includes the reversal of the PS 210 m impact seen in the second half of last year primarily relating to our decision to delay the implementation of a new general ledger system. Our planned progress was held back by the timing of non-trade related payments, the deleveraging effect of lower sales in Central Europe and the continued prioritisation of securing availability for customers ahead of potential Brexit deadlines. These factors were partly offset by a refinement of payment terms with our largest suppliers. The PS 240 m impact shown in the table overleaf in working capital relating to week 53 is primarily driven by the timing of a fuel payment. Cash capital expenditure was PS142m lower year-on-year as we maintain our disciplined approach to capital investment. An PS80m reduction in cash interest principally relates to debt maturities and bond tenders at a significantly lower rate of interest. Cash interest also includes the interest element of lease rental payments, which reduced by PS26m year-on-year as leases were utilised and we bought back a number of other leasehold properties. Retail cash tax paid in the year was PS271m, a decrease of PS31m year-on-year. The decrease year-on-year was due to IFRS 16 transitional adjustments and a higher charge for fair value remeasurements in the period, which are both eligible for cash tax relief. We generated PS258m of property proceeds including PS167m from the sale of properties in Central Europe, mainly in Poland. We utilised PS172m of cash primarily for the buyback of our Blandford, Chesterfield and High Wycombe stores, which will result in an annual cash rental saving of PS8m. Net finance costs before exceptional charges, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments reduced by PS76m year-on-year to PS 746 m, mainly driven by a reduction in net interest payable following debt maturities, bond tenders and new debt issued at a significantly lower rate of interest. In addition, finance charges payable on lease liabilities reduced by PS26m year-on-year due to ongoing lease utilisation and the buyback of 21 leasehold properties in the year. Fair value remeasurements of financial instruments increased by PS73m year-on-year driven by a fall in inflation expectations impacting the new index-linked swaps, which offset those put in place as part of historical sale and leaseback property transactions. The swaps were restructured to eliminate the impact of future inflation on the Group's cash flow in relation to these property transactions. Fair value remeasurements also includes PS 65 m primarily relating to the premium paid on the repurchase on long-dated bonds last year: PS 121 m. Net pension finance costs decreased by PS18m year-on-year, primarily due to a lower opening pension deficit. For the 2020 21 financial year, net pension finance costs are expected to be no more than c. PS55m. The exact cost will depend on the timing of the one-off pension contribution of PS2.5bn, described overleaf. The exceptional charge of PS 180 m included in net finance costs relates to actions taken to remove inflation risk from the historical sale and leaseback property transactions. The charge, which is non-cash, relates to the revaluation of credit risk associated with the historical swaps, described above, over a shorter timeframe. An exceptional credit of PS29m relates to a fair value remeasurement as part of the sale of Tesco Bank's mortgage book that was completed in September. Group tax Tax on Group profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was PS 430 m, PS33m higher than last year due to increased profitability. This year's charge also includes a credit arising from closing a number of issues relating to prior years across the Group. Group cash tax paid in the year was PS340m, including PS207m of corporate tax paid in the UK. Following the reversal of the enacted 2% reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax from 1 April 2020, we now expect the Group's effective tax rate to be around 21% in the medium term. For the 2020 21 financial year we expect an effective tax rate of c. 24% as a result of a one-off rate change impact from revaluing deferred tax from 17% to 19%. As previously announced, following changes to the timing of UK corporation tax payments, in common with other large UK companies we will have two additional quarterly cash payments in the 2021 fiscal year. This change effectively moves from payment of around half the tax liability after the financial year end to full payment in-year, and is expected to create a one-off additional cash outflow in the first half of our 2020 21 financial year. As part of the use of proceeds from the proposed sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, we intend to make a PS2.5bn one-off contribution into the UK defined benefit pension scheme. As the Group will receive tax relief on this contribution, it is anticipated that the level of cash tax payable will be reduced by c. PS120m in the year of payment and c. PS60m per annum in the following three years. On a statutory 53-week basis, the total tax charge is PS 380 m which includes a PS53m credit relating to exceptional items. Earnings per share This year 53-week basis Exclude week 53 This year 52-week basis Last year Diluted EPS pre-exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments 18.23p 0.31 p 17.92p 14.01p Statutory diluted earnings per share 9.54p - n a 13.04p Statutory basic earnings per share 9.60p - n a 13.13p Our diluted earnings per share before exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments was 17.92p, 27.9% higher year-on-year, due to our improved profit performance. Statutory basic earnings per share from continuing operations were 9.60p, 26.9 % lower year-on-year, primarily reflecting the change in the level of exceptional items year-on-year. 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 We purchased PS149m of shares in the market following our commitment to offset any dilution from the issuance of new shares to satisfy the requirements of share schemes. Going forward we continue to expect to utilise c. PS150m a year, with the precise amount depending on performance and market conditions. The increase in repayments of obligations under leases of PS27m is largely offset by a corresponding decrease within the interest element of lease rental payments included in net interest. As previously announced, we will make a PS0.3bn pension deficit contribution in the 2020 21 financial year, which in addition to the proposed one-off PS2.5bn contribution in the second half of 2020, is expected to eliminate the funding deficit and significantly reduce the prospect of having to make further deficit contributions in the future, releasing c. PS260m of annual free cash flow.

Our capital expenditure for the year was PS1.1bn, broadly level on the prior year, and was primarily focused on store maintenance and refits. In the UK & ROI spend has related to the maintenance of our stores in addition to 18 new Express store openings and our temporary replacement store in Kennington. We also opened five Jack's stores in the UK, bringing the total to 12. In Central Europe, our programme to address unproductive selling space by either refitting, downsizing or repurposing stores is now largely complete. In Poland we moved to a two-format model, which involved closing or resizing all hypermarkets to our better performing compact hypermarket format. The total space reduction in Central Europe was c. 3 million sq. In Asia we opened two new stores in Malaysia, following favourable legislation changes and a further 54 new stores in Thailand, primarily in our Express format. Following the proposed sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, in future years we expect our annual Group capital expenditure to be within a range of PS0.9bn to PS1.2bn. Statutory capital expenditure of PS2.1bn includes PS914m relating to the acquisition of full control of the The Tesco Atrato Limited Partnership comprising 15 stores and two distribution centres and PS136m relating to the buyback of a number of other leasehold properties in the year. This year Last year UK & ROI PS769m PS709m Central Europe PS108m PS130m Asia PS134m PS235m Tesco Bank PS52m PS31m Group PS1,063m PS1,105m Property. The estimated market value of our fully owned property as at the year end increased by PS0.4bn to PS21.7bn. The market value of PS21.7bn represents a surplus of PS2.8bn over the net book value. Our Group freehold property ownership percentage, by value, has increased by 2% year-on-year. In September we completed the purchase of our partner's 50% stake in The Tesco Atrato Limited Partnership property joint venture, which includes 15 stores and two distribution centres. This asset acquisition increased our percentage of fully owned property in UK & ROI by c. 2% and will lead to an annualised cash rental saving of PS41m. The repurchase of three large stores in the UK also supported an improvement in the percentage of fully-owned property, in addition to an annualised cash rental saving of PS8m. Reflecting the strength of our performance last year and given our robust liquidity and balance sheet, we propose to pay a final dividend of 6.50 pence per Ordinary share. This takes the total dividend for the year to 9.15 pence per Ordinary share, up 58.6% year-on-year, including the payment of an interim dividend of 2.65 pence per Ordinary share in November 2019. We expect to maintain a full-year dividend payout ratio of 50% going forward and from 2020 21 our interim dividend will be set at 35% of the prior year full-year dividend. The proposed final dividend was approved by the Board of Directors on 7 April 2020 and is subject to the approval of shareholders at this year's AGM. The final dividend will be paid on 3 July 2020 to shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on 22 May 2020 the Record Date. Shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividend in the dividend reinvestment plan DRIP. The last date for receipt of DRIP elections and revocations will be 12 June 2020. COVID-19 is having a material impact on the operations of our business and we are incurring significant additional costs, particularly in payroll as we recruit additional colleagues to meet demand and cover the work of those colleagues who are absent and being paid. While the full financial impact of the crisis for 2020 21 is impossible to predict with a high degree of certainty, we have considered a range of scenarios to understand potential outcomes on our business and plan appropriately. Dependent on the scenario, the estimated impact on our retail cost lines is between c. PS 650 m and c. PS 925 m including significant cost increases in payroll, distribution and store expenses. At this stage it would not be prudent to provide financial guidance for 2020 21, however if customer behaviour were to return to normal by August it is likely that the additional cost headwinds incurred in our retail operations would be largely offset by the benefits of food volume increases, 12 months' business rates relief in the UK and prudent operations management. Tesco Bank, which operates as a standalone regulated entity, is expected to be impacted by a reduction in income from all of its activities, including credit cards, loans and travel money. This expected decrease in income, in addition to provisions for potential bad debts, is likely to result in a loss for the Bank in the year ending February 2021. Notwithstanding this, the Bank's capital ratios Tier 1 ratio: 20.6% and Total ratio: 23.1% as at 29 February 2020 and liquidity are expected to remain strong. 11 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Strategic report Key performance indicators Our Big 6 KPIs. Sustainable growth in sales is important to our business model. A strong, growing business also creates opportunities for our suppliers to grow with us too. Group sales is a measure of revenue excluding sales made at petrol filling stations. It demonstrates the Group's underlying performance in the core retail and financial services businesses by removing the volatilities associated with the movement in fuel prices. Group sales declined by 1.0 % at constant exchange rates and 0.7 % at actual exchange rates, to PS56.5bn.

The plan delivers the Group's purpose of 'serving shoppers a little better every day' and is underpinned by a clear strategic focus on driving sustainable and profitable growth through innovation and technology. The Group conducts an annual strategic planning process, comprising a comprehensive reassessment of progress against the Group's strategic objectives alongside a careful evaluation of the longer-term opportunities and risks in each market in which the Group operates. The process for assessing the principal and emerging risks in each market is an important input to this process. The Group's strategic planning and viability statement are considered over a three-year period, as this horizon most appropriately reflects the dynamic and changing retail environment in which the Group operates. Long-term planning process The long-term planning process builds from the Group's current position and considers the evolution of the strategic objectives over the next three years. As part of this process, a longer-term assessment of the prospects of the Group is also considered. Current position The Group has delivered on every part of the turnaround plan outlined in 2016 and continues the transformation of the business at pace, supported by: - A strategic focus on driving growth across the Group through innovation and technology. - A clear set of financial priorities to deliver cash profit, free cash flow and earnings per share growth, underpinned by a robust capital allocation framework. - A diversified portfolio of businesses covering retail, wholesaling, banking and data science. Refer to the Group Chief Executive's review on page 3 and the Financial review from page 7 for further detail regarding the Group's strategic and financial progress. Longer-term prospects The following factors are considered both in the formulation of the Group's strategic plan, and in the longer-term assessment of the Group's prospects: - The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, as well as emerging risks as they are identified such as climate change, and the Group's response to these. - The prevailing economic climate and global economy, competitor activity, market dynamics and changing customer behaviours. - The potential shortand longer-term economic impact of Brexit. - How the Group can best position itself to take advantage of the rapidly evolving retail market and structural shifts in how customers shop. - Opportunities for further cost reduction through operational simplification and leveraging technology. - The resilience afforded by the Group's operational scale. Assessing the Group's viability The viability of the Group has been assessed, taking into account the Group's current financial position, including external funding in place over the assessment period, and after modelling the impact of certain scenarios arising from the Group's principal risks outlined on pages 13 to 18. Four 'severe but plausible' scenarios have been modelled that address the principal risks that the Group has assessed would have the most direct and material impact on the Group. None of these scenarios, either individually or in aggregate threaten the viability of the Company. Scenario Associated principal risks Description Competitive pressure - Brand, reputation and trust - Competition and markets - Customer Failure to respond to fierce competition and changes in the retail market drive sustained like-for-like volume decline in core food categories with no offsetting price inflation, putting pressure on margins. Scenario Associated principal risks Description Data security or regulatory breach - Brand, reputation and trust - Data security and data privacy - Political, regulatory and compliance A serious data security or regulatory breach results in a significant monetary penalty, and a loss of customer reputation. The modelling of this scenario is approached via a 'reverse-stress test' given the inherent uncertainty of value. This assesses the risk in the context of the residual headroom after all other downside scenarios have been applied. Brexit impact - Competition and markets - Political, regulatory and compliance - Brexit Assumes a no-deal Brexit scenario which results in an increase to cost of goods sold. A broad assessment of the potential impact has been modelled including: higher import tariffs, higher sourcing costs from a weaker Sterling, higher labour costs and the potential cost of customs friction from border controls. Appropriate mitigation options open to the Group have also been considered within this scenario. Reduction in cost savings and cash generation - Transformation - Liquidity Failure to achieve the Group's transformation objectives resulting in an inability to progress sufficiently quickly to maintain or increase operating margin and generate sufficient cash to meet business objectives. Impact of COVID-19 - COVID-19 - Liquidity - Tesco Bank Assumes a 12-week lockdown and phased recovery. A broad assessment of the financial impact has been modelled including the impact on sales, margin and operating costs. In modelling the scenario, the Group has considered the potential impact on retail, catering and wholesale sales, the cost implications of the operational actions being taken to continue to serve customers, together with the impact of reduced income from the mall businesses in Central Europe and Asia. The Bank has modelled an economic downturn scenario from the impact of COVID-19 in relation to the expected credit losses on its lending book. The Bank has sourced updated macroeconomic projections from a third-party provider and has used this modelling to assess the adequacy of capital and liquidity in place to support the business through the expected economic downturn. These scenarios assumed that external debt is repaid as it becomes due and committed facilities renewed as they become due. The scenarios above are hypothetical and purposefully severe with the aim of creating outcomes that have the ability to threaten the viability of the Group. In the case of these scenarios arising, various options are available to the Group in order to maintain liquidity so as to continue in operation such as: i accessing new external funding early: ii more radical short-term cost reduction actions: and iii reducing capital expenditure. None of these actions are assumed in our current scenario modelling. Viability statement Based on these severe but plausible scenarios, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period considered. Longer-term viability statement 19 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Strategic report In June 2017 Tesco publicly committed to implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD. We recognise climate change as the biggest environmental threat the world faces, and one which poses particular challenges to our business including our supply chain and operations. Conversely, effectively responding to climate change can enhance our business resilience and enable us to take advantage of any opportunities it may offer. Our first TCFD scenario analyses were conducted in the financial year 2018 19, assessing the UK business - our biggest market. We prioritised produce, animal protein categories as well as our UK estate. Produce and animal protein are key commercial categories, with supply chains around the world. We assessed the risks and opportunities we may face in 2030 under two climate scenarios: a 'Pessimistic' scenario and an 'Optimistic' scenario. The 'Pessimistic' scenario is where the world fails to address climate change, leading to global temperatures continuing to rise well above 2 degrees. This scenario assumes limited policy or regulatory support and looks at physical climate risks. The 'Optimistic' scenario is where the world rises to the challenge of tackling climate change and limits global warming to well below 2 degrees. This low-carbon transition scenario centres on the rapid changes that will be needed by 2030 to cut emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. Our scenarios are based on those developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Our scenario analyses assessed Tesco's exposure to physical climate risks such as rising temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns and extreme weather events. Beyond physical risks, we also assessed risks and opportunities arising from a transition to a low-carbon world aligned with the Paris Agreement. These transition risks are a result of market and societal shifts related to agriculture, diets and energy use. For produce, we focused on agricultural production by country and product. Our assessments indicate some physical risks and opportunities to our produce supply chain. For animal protein, our assessment focused on milk, beef, lamb and chicken. The assessment shows transition risks and opportunities arising from potential policy and societal shifts. To assess climate risks on our property estate, we assessed how our stores and distribution centres might fare under these scenarios. Produce The results of our risk assessment indicate physical risks as well as unrealised opportunities to our produce supply chain. For example, long-term changes in temperature and rainfall patterns chronic climate change will adversely impact production by 2030. The countries most impacted will be South Africa, Egypt, Spain and Peru. In the UK, our analysis shows that higher temperatures and rainfall by 2030 can support a longer growing season. This can potentially increase yield for certain crops if other growing conditions such as land availability and soil fertility are also favourable. We are currently sharing these results with our supply partners and working with those in the impacted areas to conduct more detailed scenario analyses and mitigation planning. Protein The results of our scenario analysis show transition risks to our protein supply chain. These include societal dietary shifts away from animal protein as well as potential new policies aimed at keeping global temperature rises well below 2 degrees. Opportunities identified include projected growth in plant-based food and meat alternatives. Working with our key suppliers, we are expanding our plant-based ranges, addressing the climate impacts of livestock farming as well as supporting effective climate policy development. UK property Our scenario analysis of climate risks facing our UK estate shows both physical and transition climate risks. For example, some of our stores and distribution centres, especially those in the South East region, will face an increased risk of flooding as a result of climate change. Effective policies to address carbon emissions from energy could increase our compliance costs. These results are informing our risk management and business continuity plans. Our renewable electricity transition plan forms part of our mitigation plan, enabling us to switch to onsite renewable electricity generation as well as long-term power purchase agreements which provide price stability and limit our exposure to high carbon prices. Our LHP outlines our climate change commitments, both for our own operations and our supply chain. The Corporate Responsibility Committee is responsible for climate change as part of the LHP. The Committee meets three times during the year and receives regular updates on our LHP commitments and performance. This year, results of the TCFD analysis were presented to the Executive Committee and the Corporate Responsibility Committee. Climate risks were also evaluated at the Audit Committee as part of the overall risk framework. The identification and management of climate-related risks follow our established risk management process. Key elements of the risk management process are set out on page 13. Following our assessment of emerging risks, climate change has been highlighted and is considered an integral part of both the responsible sourcing and supply chain, and the brand, reputation and trust principal risks on pages 17 and 15. Principal risks are monitored by the Audit Committee to ensure effective management and mitigation through our policies, processes, practices and performance. In May 2017, Tesco announced new science-based climate targets for our own operations and supply chain. Our own operations targets are aligned with the Paris Agreement's aspiration to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. We are on track to reduce absolute carbon emissions from our operations from 2015 16 levels by 35% by 2020, 60% by 2025 and 100% by 2050. To help us meet these targets, we have committed to source 100% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Our science-based climate change targets for our supply chain includes explicit targets for manufacturing and agricultural suppliers - recognising the different approaches required to reduce emissions in both areas. Our climate change metrics and targets are disclosed in the full LHP report available on our website. We aim to conduct climate risks assessments for all relevant parts of our business. In 2020 21, we will expand our assessment to the grocery and prepared foods categories as well as soy - a key commodity in animal feed. The results of this assessment will be reported in next year's Annual Report.

Everything we do is driven by our purpose to serve shoppers a little better every day. That means we try to get each of the 80 million weekly transactions in store right, every time, for every customer. It also means taking actions today to ensure we serve tomorrow's shoppers equally well. For 100 years, Tesco has provided affordable, quality food to customers from all walks of life and we know that to continue doing so for the next 100 years, we must continue to embrace sustainable production and consumption behaviours while adapting to the changing world around us. Our Little Helps Plan helps us to navigate our way forward, focusing on areas where we can make a big difference while supporting our values: - No one tries harder for customers shapes our belief that it's our responsibility to make the right calls on behalf of our customers: - We treat people how they want to be treated drives how we work with suppliers, partners, colleagues and communities: and - Every little help makes a big difference captures our belief that everyone at Tesco has a role to play. This encapsulates our ambition to make a positive difference. com sustainability to learn more about our activities and progress. Our Little Helps Plan helps us navigate some of the biggest challenges facing the world today. Further information about the governance of the Little Helps Plan and a full review of our activity and performance against our KPIs can be found on our website and within the comprehensive Little Helps Plan Report available online. Our Little Helps Plan is the framework through which we shape our long-term approach to sustainability and enables us to demonstrate, monitor and improve our performance, both within our own operations and the wider supply chain. The Plan focuses on the aspects of sustainability that are most relevant for Tesco and our stakeholders and demonstrates the positive contribution we make toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals SDGs by measuring our impacts, targeting our responses and framing our collaboration with key stakeholders to scale our efforts. This year we have refreshed the framework. After incorporating stakeholder feedback and external trends, we have integrated our previous foundation areas under the existing three pillars while creating a fourth pillar - Planet. This new pillar provides a platform for the work we're doing to address important environmental issues such as climate change, deforestation and sustainable agriculture. Our Code of Business Conduct underpins everything we do to ensure we remain a responsible, safe, ethical business both within our own operations and across our global supply chain. 21 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Strategic report Little Helps Plan continued Our Product pillar focuses on addressing issues related to health, food waste, packaging and animal welfare as we strive to provide affordable, sustainable, healthy products while ensuring that we never compromise on product safety. At Tesco, we have no time for waste and we have committed to help halve food waste from farm to fork in each of the markets in which we operate in line with UN SDG Target 12.3. We publish our food waste data for every market in the Group. Our target is that no food that is safe for human consumption will be wasted in our UK retail operations. Over the course of this year, we have reached 77% of our target as we have embedded new processes to ensure our progress is sustainable. Our customers, colleagues and those within our supply chain are vital to our continued success. As an employer of choice, we remain committed to treating people how they want to be treated and giving everyone the opportunity to get on. Our latest gender pay gap report can be found on our website. Decent, fair, safe work for all. With more than 400,000 colleagues around the world and millions of people who work within our supply chain, we are committed to promoting human rights and seek to ensure that there is decent, fair, safe work for all. Health and safety is central to how we do business and we are committed to our vision that no one should ever be hurt while working or shopping at Tesco. We have seen a 17% reduction in our injury volume year-on-year in our UK, Republic of Ireland and Central Europe businesses. Our accident frequency rate has also reduced by 7%. This has been primarily driven by continued efforts to strengthen our operating routines and an unrelenting focus on safe colleague behaviour as a culture across Tesco. The world of work is changing and preparing colleagues with the skills needed for the future is a top priority. This year we have continued to invest in digital skills for colleagues. Across the UK, Central Europe and Asia, our digital champions have delivered over 90,000 learning opportunities to improve the digital confidence of colleagues, and in India we have helped develop more than 200 colleagues in leading on automation and continuous improvement. Other key priorities for this year included developing diverse talent and building diversity and inclusion capability across all levels of the business. We continued to build an understanding of diversity and inclusion among colleagues and leaders through the introduction of digital learning and have leveraged our colleague networks to help inform the agenda. This includes making commitments to the Race at Work Charter and The Valuable 500. We'five also renewed our colleague engagement approach through the launch of our Every Voice Matters programme, which will help give more timely and responsive insight into how our colleagues are feeling across the Group and enable us to drive more focused action. Beyond our own colleagues, our human rights strategy focuses on four priority areas within our supply chain: sustainable livelihoods, forced labour, worker representation and gender equality. We support our suppliers to comply with the Ethical Trade Initiative ETI Base Code and undertake due diligence to help them meet our standards on human rights. This year 97% of critical non-conformances identified at our tier 1 suppliers were remediated on time and we continue to work with the remaining 3% to resolve these issues. In December 2019, a UK customer found a handwritten message within a Christmas card we sold reading 'please help us and notify human rights organisation'. We immediately launched an investigation and removed the cards from sale. While we did not find evidence of prison labour, we found other issues of concern that had regrettably not been identified by the independent auditor who had visited the previous month. We ceased working with the factory and supplier and have since reviewed our whole supply base for cards. Further information is provided in our Modern Slavery Statement available on our website.

Packaging: Remove, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. We are committed to only using packaging where it serves a purpose. This year in the UK we announced our Remove, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle plan to deliver our goals. Since 2018, we have removed over 10,000 tonnes of hard-to-recycle packaging from our Own Brand products and we pledged to remove one billion pieces of plastic from products for sale in UK stores by the end of 2020. In January we announced the elimination of 350 tonnes of plastic wrap from 67 million tinned food multipacks. We continually adjust the recipes of our Own Brand products to help customers lead healthier lives and respond to changing dietary preferences. In 2019, we more than doubled the range of our exclusive plant-based range Wicked Kitchen and also launched new products within our Tesco branded range, Plant Chef. We now have over 300 lines of targeted plant-based products. As a Peas Please Pledger and a supporter of Veg Power, we are committed to increasing vegetable consumption and 42% of our chilled and frozen ready meals now contribute at least 1 of 5 a day, up from 26% in 2018. Our long-term success depends on the health of the natural environment. The climate crisis, global biodiversity loss and the inefficient way in which resources are consumed present a real threat to our ability to provide customers with affordable, healthy, sustainable food. Details on our carbon strategy are provided on page 67 and our response to the recommendations of TCFD can be found on page 20. Halving the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket. In 2018, we launched our ground-breaking partnership with WWF to make it easier for customers to buy affordable, healthy, sustainable food. This year we jointly launched the Sustainable Basket Metric, which will help us track our progress in halving the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket against seven key sustainability issues.

In discharging our section 172 duty, we have regard for these factors taking them into consideration when decisions are made. Examples of how the Directors have oversight of stakeholder matters and had regard for these matters when making decisions are set out on pages 40 to 43. This Strategic report, including the non-financial reporting statement below, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, has been approved and signed on behalf of the Board. We are proud to be a valued member of thousands of communities around the world, and we are passionate about playing an active role in helping these communities thrive - from the jobs we provide to the good causes we support. This year, across the Group, we have donated PS98m to good causes through our charity partnerships, community grant programmes and colleague and customer fundraising. We continued to support our three national health charity partners: Cancer Research UK, Diabetes UK and the British Heart Foundation with the aim of lowering the risk of heart and circulatory disease, cancer and Type 2 diabetes. In the UK this year, we raised over PS6.6m through store events, donations and fundraising activity. A showcase moment was almost 5,000 people taking part in our biggest fundraising event Dance Beats - the longest dance marathon relay ever at Wembley Stadium, 30 hours of continuous dancing to claim the GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS r and donate PS2m to our charity partners. Beyond our corporate charity partners, we also continued to support local community groups with our Bags of Help scheme in the UK, Community Fund initiative in Ireland and our You Choose, We Help programme in Central Europe, allowing customers to Places. Robert Welch Group Company Secretary 7 April 2020 decide which local projects receive funding. To celebrate our 100th birthday, this year we introduced increased funding for larger projects with our Bags of Help Centenary grants in England, Scotland and Wales and, in Northern Ireland, our Tesco Centenary Fund. We announced that we will be introducing Bags of Help in Northern Ireland in 2020. This dedicated grant will see community groups share more than PS125,000 across the year. One of our important commitments is that no food that is safe for human consumption will be wasted in our UK retail operations. In support of that commitment, we continued our work with FareShare to donate surplus food from our stores through Community Food Connection. Since 2016 we have donated over 48 million meals to people in crisis through this initiative in the UK. We now run surplus food donation programmes in all the markets in which we operate. Our Tesco Food Collection programme encourages customers to donate long-life food to our charity partners, The Trussell Trust, who have a network of over 400 foodbanks, and FareShare, who redistribute surplus food to a network of charities including homeless hostels, women's refuges and breakfast clubs. 23 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Strategic report - Group strategy, operating plans, long-term plans and budget: - Changes to corporate and capital structure: - Major acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures and disposals: - Significant capital expenditure and borrowing: - Material contracts: - Risk management and internal control: - Changes to pension scheme: - Financial reporting and disclosures: - Review of remuneration policies and share schemes: and - Dividend policy and payment. The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the Group ensuring that it operates within a framework of effective controls. The Board is responsible for setting the overall strategy of the Group ensuring that value is created over the long-term. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board of those matters that are considered of significance to the Group owing to their strategic, financial or reputational importance. Further details are set out below. The Board has a detailed programme that ensures operational and financial performance, risk, governance, strategy, culture and stakeholder engagement are discussed at the appropriate time. At Board meetings, Directors receive and consider papers and presentations from the Executive Directors, senior management and subject-matter experts. The Board challenges management to ensure that the flow and quality of information to the Board is of a high standard. A review and refresh of Board and Committee papers was undertaken during the year to ensure that high-quality, clear and timely information is provided to Directors supporting the Board in its decision-making process. In the rare event of a Director being unable to attend a meeting, the Chair of the respective meeting discusses the matters proposed with the Director concerned wherever possible, seeking their support and feedback accordingly. The Chair subsequently represents those views at the meeting. The operations of the Board are underpinned by the collective experience of the Directors and the diverse skills and experience which they possess. These ensure that leadership and decisionmaking is focused and balanced, and is approached with independent thought and judgement. With the relationship between the Directors being one of trust and mutual respect, open and frank conversations ensure that even the most challenging decisions are taken for the benefit of the Company as a whole, with due consideration for all stakeholders who may be affected. Role statements set out the division of responsibilities between the Chairman and Group Chief Executive as well as the responsibilities of the Senior Independent Director and Non-executive Directors ensuring challenge, debate and an independent and objective mindset. Chairman The Chairman is responsible for effective leadership of the Board and maintaining a culture of openness and transparency at Board meetings. The Chairman promotes the effective communication between Executive and Non-executive Directors and ensures all Directors effectively contribute to discussions and feel comfortable in engaging in healthy debate and constructive challenge. The Chairman ensures all Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information to assist them to make their decisions, identifies training and development needs as required, and ensures appropriately tailored induction programmes are delivered for new Directors. Group Chief Executive The Group Chief Executive has day-to-day responsibility for the effective management of the Group's business and for ensuring that Board decisions are implemented. He plays a key role in devising and reviewing Group strategies for discussion and approval by the Board. The Group Chief Executive is tasked with providing regular operational updates to the Board on all matters of significance relating to the Group's business or reputation and for ensuring effective communication with shareholders and other key stakeholders. Senior Independent Director The Senior Independent Director provides a sounding board for the Chairman and acts as an intermediary for the Non-executive Directors, where necessary, and is available to shareholders should they have any concerns where communication through normal channels has not been successful or where such channels are inappropriate. The Senior Independent Director meets with the Non-executive Directors at least annually when leading the Non-executive Directors appraisal of the performance of the Chairman. Non-executive Directors The Non-executive Directors bring insight and experience to the Board. They have responsibility for constructively challenging the strategies proposed by the Executive Directors, scrutinising the performance of management in achieving agreed goals and objectives and play leading roles in the functioning of the Board Committees, bringing an independent view to the discussion. They meet with the Senior Independent Director to review the Chairman's performance and other matters. Group Company Secretary The Group Company Secretary is secretary to the Board. His responsibilities include ensuring the Board has the information, time and resources it needs in order to discharge its duties and function effectively and efficiently. The schedule of matters reserved for the Board can be found at www. Summary of matters reserved for the Board. 33 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Corporate governance The Group Company Secretary advises the Board on all governance matters and facilitates induction programmes for new Directors and provides briefings and guidance on governance, legal and regulatory matters. The appointment and removal of the Group Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board as a whole. Regular Board and Committee meetings are scheduled throughout the year ensuring that Directors allocate sufficient time to discharge their duties effectively. During the year, the Board held six scheduled meetings and additional strategy and planning days, which included presentations by senior management on each of the business areas. In addition to scheduled meetings, the Board held additional meetings to consider matters of a time-sensitive nature, including the proposed sale of the Thailand and Malaysia businesses. Directors are expected to attend all Board and relevant Committee meetings. The table on page 30 shows the record of attendance at the scheduled Board and Committee meetings. The nature of the Non-executive Director role makes it impossible to be specific about the maximum time commitment. However, it is anticipated that at least 20 days per annum after the induction phase is required plus additional time to devote to preparation ahead of each meeting. Directors are also required to regularly update and refresh their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the Company. It is recognised that at certain times it may be necessary to convene additional Board, Committee or shareholder meetings. Prior to appointment, the Nominations and Governance Committee assesses the commitments of a proposed candidate, including other directorships, to ensure they have sufficient time to devote to the role. Thereafter, the Committee regularly assesses the time commitments of Directors to ensure that they each continue to have sufficient time for their role. This assessment takes into account the number of external commitments each Director has and considers the potential additional time required in the event of corporate stress. Directors obtain approval prior to undertaking additional external appointments. Directors are required to report actual or potential conflicts of interest to the Board for consideration and, if appropriate, authorisation. If such conflicts exist, Directors excuse themselves from consideration of the relevant matter. The Company maintains a register of authorised conflicts of interest which is reviewed annually by the Nominations and Governance Committee. Details of the Directors' service contracts and terms of appointment, together with their interests in the Company's shares, are shown in the Directors' remuneration report on pages 52 to 64. If Directors have concerns about the Company or a proposed action which cannot be resolved, it is recorded in the Board minutes. Upon resignation, Directors are encouraged to provide a written statement of any concerns for consideration by the Board. No such concerns were raised in 2019 20 and up to the date of this report. All Directors have access to the advice of the Group Company Secretary and, in appropriate circumstances, may obtain independent professional advice at the Company's expense. No such requests were made in 2019 20. A Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance policy is maintained for all Directors and each Director has the benefit of a Deed of Indemnity. The Board is supported by the activities of each of the Board Committees which ensure the right level of attention and consideration are given to specific matters.

Through matters reserved for the Board, Committee terms of reference and a robust delegated authority framework, it sets out how the business is managed and ensures effective and efficient decision-making through defined authority levels. Efficient internal reporting, internal controls and oversight of current and emerging risks are embedded into our business processes which align to the Group's strategy, purpose and values. The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to four key Board Committees which are each chaired by an Independent Non-executive Director, focusing on specific areas of the Board's responsibilities. The composition of each Committee is reviewed by the Nominations and Governance Committee annually and also at the time of any Board changes. Cross-Committee membership provides visibility and awareness of matters relevant between the Committees. Each Committee Chair provides a written and verbal report on Committee activities to the Board after each Committee meeting and Committee papers and minutes are shared with all Directors. The Board delegates responsibility for the day-to-day operational management of the Company to the Group Chief Executive, who is supported by the Executive Committee, Group Risk and Compliance Committee and other committees. When the need arises, a standing Disclosure Committee is convened to consider timely and accurate disclosure of sensitive information and the Board has agreed a Delegation of Authority. Matters considered by each of the Committees are set out in the Committee terms of reference which can be found at www. Having a diverse Board with different perspectives, insights and viewpoints benefits the Group's stakeholders through better business performance.

The Board sets the tone for inclusion and diversity across the Group and believes it is important to have an appropriate balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity on the Board and at senior management level to ensure good decision-making. It recognises the need to create conditions that foster talent and encourage all colleagues to achieve their full potential. To this end, we are committed to providing an inclusive working environment where difference is embraced and valued, as evidenced by our commitment to the Race at Work Charter. More detail on the Group's employment policies are set out in the Directors' report on pages 65 to 66. The Board, Nominations and Governance Committee, and Executive Committee receive regular updates on the progress of diversity and inclusion initiatives across the Group, with the goal of ensuring all colleagues have an opportunity to get on, developing the skills they need for now and the future, whoever they are, wherever they work and whatever they do. The Board has adopted a Board diversity and inclusion policy which sets out its approach to diversity and inclusion on the Board. This policy sits alongside the Company's equal opportunities and diversity policy, which sets out the Group's wider commitment to diversity and inclusion across Tesco. More information on the implementation of the Board diversity and inclusion policy can be found in the Nominations and Governance Committee report on pages 38 to 39. The policy can be found on the Company's website at www. 35 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Corporate governance Board expertise. The Board's skills matrix supports our approach to diversity by mapping the broad diversity of the Board in regard to gender, ethnicity, geographical expertise, professional background, tenure, age and other distinctions between Directors, linking these to our strategy. This enables the Board to develop a refreshment and succession plan for Non-executive Directors that meets the future needs of the Group. This is vital for bringing the expertise required and enabling different perspectives, insights and viewpoints to be brought to Board and Committee meetings. As set out in their biographies on pages 27 to 30, each member of the Board offers a range of core skills and experience that is relevant to the successful operation of the Group, while providing a strong independent element to the Board and a solid foundation for good corporate governance, fulfilling the vital role of corporate accountability. The oversight each of the Directors provides is balanced with individuals contributing a broad range of skills, diverse experience and knowledge, demonstrating independence and constructive challenge. The Nominations and Governance Committee considers whether each of the Non-executive Directors continues to be independent in character and judgement in line with the definition set out in the Code. For more information on the conclusion of the review undertaken by the Committee see pages 38 to 39. The Non-executive Directors met with the Chairman without the Executive Directors being present on a number of occasions and, at least annually, Directors meet with the Senior Independent Director to review the Chairman's performance and other matters. Non-executive Directors are initially appointed for a three-year term with an expectation that they will continue for at least a further three years. Directors are nominated by the Nominations and Governance Committee and are subsequently approved by the Board for election or re-election annually by shareholders at the Company's AGM. After three years' service the performance of a Non-executive Director is rigorously assessed by the Nominations and Governance Committee. Any development needs identified are discussed by the Chairman with the Non-executive Director. All Directors will submit themselves for election or re-election at the forthcoming AGM in June 2020. Detailed information on the contribution that each of the Directors brings to the Board is set out in the Board biographies on pages 27 to 30 and in the 2020 Notice of Annual General Meeting. Upon appointment, all new Directors receive a comprehensive induction programme over a number of months which is designed to facilitate their understanding of the business and is tailored to their individual needs. The Chairman and the Group Company Secretary are responsible for delivering the programme covering the Company's core purpose and values, strategy, key areas of the business and corporate governance. The Board believes strongly in the development of its Directors and the Group's colleagues. The Chairman regularly discusses training requirements with each Director. New Director induction programme is delivered through: - meetings with senior managers across the Group as well as a number of advisors: - attendance at Committee meetings: - site visits to stores and distribution centres: - working in a store, providing an opportunity to meet colleagues and see at first hand the operations of a store: and - access to a library of reference materials. In support of the ongoing development of Directors, teach-ins and technical updates are provided at Board and Committee meetings to ensure that Directors remain up to date with key developments in the business environment in which Tesco operates. Directors are encouraged to attend training sessions to ensure their knowledge is up to date on relevant legal, regulatory and financial developments or changes. The Board receives presentations on each of the business areas to understand the market conditions and challenges in the different countries the Group operates in. Directors have spent time individually and collectively exploring specific operational activities in detail through presentations, meetings and site visits giving them the opportunity to meet with local senior management to gain an insight of the business operations. The Board visits our overseas business functions on a regular basis to gain a greater understanding of the market conditions that the business operates in and to understand the challenges they face. This provides in-depth knowledge for the Directors, enabling them to share their own experiences and challenge the business. In June 2019, the Board travelled to Thailand to meet colleagues and customers, and gain a greater understanding of the Thai business operations and retail market. During the trip, the Board visited one of our Thai hypermarkets in Bangkok taking part in the 'hypermarket reinvention' programme. The programme optimises sales floor space to better cater to today's customers and their shopping experience, as well as maximising efficiency and simplifying store processes. Corporate governance report continued Composition, succession and evaluation continued Further details of the Group's approach to diversity and inclusion can be found online at www. 36 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Good corporate governance is about implementing the right systems and controls across the Group to facilitate effective management and sound decision-making. Board Committee composition, expertise and dynamics Strategic oversight, culture and stakeholders Effectiveness Board support, management focus of meetings, paper content, time allocation Risk management and internal control Succession planning and human resource management Board effectiveness. The internal evaluation concluded that the Board, its Committees and each of its Directors continue to be effective, with high scores being recorded across each of the themes. All Directors continued to demonstrate a collaborative and constructive mindset, creating a conducive environment at Board meetings for participation and challenge. The clarity of the strategy together with the understanding of the capabilities for implementing and monitoring it were regarded highly. The internal effectiveness review identified some opportunities for the Board and the resulting areas of focus are summarised below: - greater focus on the impact of technology and the threats and opportunities of an ever-changing market on the development of a longer-term strategy: - further increase the oversight of succession planning at the Board, while maintaining the strong oversight at the Nominations and Governance Committee: and - further developing the appetite for risk and ensuring it is aligned with the emerging longer-term strategy. The Board carries out a review of the effectiveness of its performance and that of its Committees and Directors every year. The evaluation is externally facilitated every three years. The next external evaluation will be in respect of the 2021 22 financial year. Set out below is the progress made against actions identified through the 2018 19 external Board effectiveness review: Action Progress Further shaping the narrative and agreeing the priorities of the Group for the longer term. During the year, the Board held an additional strategy session which focused on long-term opportunities and threats. Regular updates were provided throughout the year to the Board and its Committees on progress against strategic developments and plans. Continuing to develop and articulate the appetite for risk and ensuring it is aligned with the emerging longer-term strategy. A risk appetite framework has been developed during the year and formalised risk appetite metrics are being progressed with the business. Additional narrative is disclosed on pages 13 to 14. Developing a refreshment and succession plan for Non-executive Directors, designed to optimise strategic relevance, diversity of perspective and governance expertise to meet the future needs of the Group. A Non-executive Director composition assessment exercise was undertaken to enable the Nominations and Governance Committee to plan for the Board changes due to occur in the next few years. A skills matrix was developed to ensure that the Board has the necessary skills to fulfil its strategic objectives. During the year, an internal evaluation was led by the Chairman, with the support of the Group Company Secretary using an online questionnaire to capture the views of each Director. The evaluation was carefully structured but pragmatic, designed to bring about a genuine debate on issues that were relevant, check on progress against matters identified in the previous evaluation, and assist in identifying any potential for improvement in the Board's processes. 37 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2020 Corporate governance",

      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE": "- **Return on Equity (ROE)** has significantly improved from approximately **7.31%** in the previous year to about **49.77%** in the current year, indicating a substantial increase in profitability relative to shareholders' equity.  \n- This sharp rise in ROE suggests the company has become much more efficient at generating profits from its equity base.  \n- Key drivers include a **recovery in retail operating profit** after the pandemic-induced decline, as the company expects retail operating profit to return to pre-COVID levels.  \n- Despite a challenging year, the company maintained **strong sales growth (7.1%)** and improved **customer loyalty and market share**, which support profitability improvements.  \n- The sale of non-core businesses (Thailand, Malaysia, Poland) and the resulting **special dividend and pension contribution** strengthened the balance sheet and may have optimized equity levels, contributing to ROE improvement.  \n- The company faced increased costs related to COVID-19 safety measures but expects most of these to diminish, which should improve margins going forward.  \n- The **banking segment's return to profitability** in the next financial year will further enhance overall group profitability and ROE.  \n- However, uncertainties remain, including the economic impact of COVID-19 recovery, Brexit-related challenges, and ongoing costs, which may impact short-term profitability and ROE stability.  \n- The company\u2019s strong focus on **capital discipline**, dividend payments, and strategic investments suggests a positive outlook for sustaining or further improving ROE.  \n- From a shareholder perspective, the improved ROE signals enhanced value creation potential, implying **better future shareholder returns** if the company continues its operational recovery and manages risks effectively.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE Driver": "- **Asset Turnover** has increased from 5.03 to 5.67, indicating the company is generating higher sales per unit of assets, reflecting improved **asset efficiency** and operational effectiveness.  \n- **Profit Margin** rose significantly from 1.5% to 10.6%, showing a substantial improvement in the company\u2019s ability to convert sales into net profits, signaling enhanced **profitability**.  \n- The sharp increase in profit margin is the more dominant driver behind the improvement in **Return on Equity (ROE)**, given the magnitude of change compared to asset turnover.  \n- The annual report highlights strong revenue growth (+7.1% Group sales) and improved value perception in the UK & ROI markets, supporting both higher sales and better margins.  \n- Despite COVID-19 related increased costs, the company managed to control expenses and invest in online capacity, which contributed to a scalable sales increase and margin expansion.  \n- The expansion of online sales (77% growth) and increased Clubcard engagement are key factors driving sales efficiency and improving **operating leverage**.  \n- Profitability was pressured by Tesco Bank losses and pandemic-related costs, but these appear to be diminishing, suggesting future margin stabilization or growth.  \n- Asset turnover is expected to benefit from ongoing investments in urban fulfillment centers and store expansions, potentially sustaining or improving asset utilization.  \n- Profit margins may see a recovery or moderate growth as COVID-19 incremental costs reduce and retail sales normalize post-pandemic, supported by strong online growth and cost control.  \n- Overall, both **asset efficiency** and **profitability** drivers are strengthening, with profitability improvements playing a more significant role in enhancing ROE and investor value creation.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of Risk": "- The company's **gearing ratio** has slightly improved from 2.48 to 2.41, indicating a modest reduction in financial leverage and potentially lower financial risk.\n- The **current ratio** decreased from 0.72 to 0.65, and the **quick ratio** fell from 0.26 to 0.24, suggesting a slight decline in short-term liquidity and ability to cover current liabilities.\n- **NLP financial risk** increased from 1.18 to 1.22, signaling a perceived rise in financial-related risk factors discussed in the report.\n- **NLP legal risk** and **NLP tax risk** also increased notably (legal: 0.48 to 0.57; tax: 0.66 to 0.87), indicating greater emphasis on potential legal and tax uncertainties.\n- The **NLP specificity** score declined slightly (0.094 to 0.090), reflecting a marginal decrease in the precision and detail of risk disclosures.\n- **NLP sentence length** and **sentence depth** remained largely stable, suggesting the complexity of language used has not materially changed, maintaining similar readability.\n- The combination of slightly reduced **specificity** with stable language complexity may hint at less clear risk reporting, potentially increasing investor uncertainty.\n- Key risk factors such as **climate change**, **COVID-19 impacts**, and **regulatory/legal issues** have become more prominent, while some operational risks appear stable or less emphasized.\n- The report reflects a heightened focus on **financial, legal, and tax risks**, likely due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and regulatory changes.\n- Forward-looking, these risks may **intensify in the short to medium term** given external pressures like Brexit, pandemic recovery, and evolving climate policies, warranting investor caution.",
      "summary": "- The company\u2019s **Return on Equity (ROE)** surged from approximately **7.31% to 49.77%**, driven primarily by a significant improvement in **profit margin** (1.5% to 10.6%) and supported by enhanced **asset turnover** (5.03 to 5.67).  \n- This reflects a marked increase in **profitability** and **asset efficiency**, fueled by strong **sales growth (7.1%)**, recovery of retail operating profits, and expansion of **online sales (77%)**.  \n- Strategic actions such as the sale of non-core businesses and **capital discipline** measures, including a special dividend and pension contributions, strengthened the **balance sheet** and optimized equity levels.  \n- Although the company faced increased **COVID-19 related costs** and challenges like Brexit, these are expected to diminish, improving future **margins** and operational leverage.  \n- The **banking segment\u2019s return to profitability** will further enhance group-wide earnings and ROE sustainability.  \n- **Liquidity ratios** declined slightly, with the **current ratio** falling to 0.65 and the **quick ratio** to 0.24, indicating a modest reduction in short-term liquidity coverage.  \n- **Financial leverage** improved modestly, with the **gearing ratio** decreasing from 2.48 to 2.41, reducing financial risk somewhat.  \n- However, increased **financial, legal, and tax risks** alongside a slight decline in **risk disclosure specificity** may heighten investor uncertainty amid ongoing macroeconomic and regulatory challenges.  \n- The company\u2019s focus on **cost control**, strategic investment, and operational recovery positions it well for sustained **value creation** and improved **shareholder returns**.  \n- Investor caution is warranted due to external uncertainties, but the overall outlook remains positive with strong underlying performance drivers."

The business was started in 1919 by Jack Cohen, selling surplus groceries from a stall in the East End of London. In 1929, the first Tesco store opened in Edgware, North London. Today, we have stores in five countries across Europe: the UK, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. As a leading retailer, with more than 360,000 colleagues, Tesco serves many millions of customers every week, in stores and online. Tesco completed a merger with Booker Group, the UK's leading food wholesaler, helping to create substantial synergies and access to the 'out-of-home' food market. The Tesco Group also includes Tesco Bank, which provides banking, insurance and money services: Tesco Mobile, the UK's largest mobile virtual network operator: and dunnhumby, a wholly-owned data science subsidiary. Our business is guided by the shared purpose of serving shoppers a little better every day, underpinned by three values: no one tries harder for customers: we treat people how they want to be treated: every little help makes a big difference. At Tesco, serving shoppers means more than selling food. It means acting as a responsible and sustainable business for all our stakeholders -- customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders -- and providing affordable, healthy and sustainable food for all. 4 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Building a stronger business through a difficult year. Chairman's statement Reflecting on this year, I believe it has been among the most challenging that Tesco has faced in its 101-year history. The COVID-19 pandemic brought disruption and uncertainty to our business and to all our customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders. In responding to these challenges, we were guided by our values as a business and stayed true to our purpose of serving shoppers a little better every day. COVID-19 Our response to COVID-19 has consistently focused on ensuring our customers and colleagues could shop and work safely at Tesco. This year, we reflect on the serious challenges and uncertainty our business and our colleagues have faced. We pay tribute to every colleague affected and our thoughts are with those who have lost friends and loved ones. It has been hugely difficult, but every person at Tesco rose to the challenge and went above and beyond to help each other and those in their communities. The Board continuously provided guidance and support to help our teams do the right thing, and I am very proud of the role everybody at Tesco has played during the pandemic. In March 2020, the Government granted all UK retail and hospitality businesses 12 months of business rates relief. At the time, this relief was essential to navigate the uncertainty and significant costs associated with responding to COVID-19. Towards the end of 2020, we had greater clarity on the situation and we took the decision as a Board to repay business rates relief to the Government, so that it could support businesses that needed it more. We firmly believe it was the right thing to do and is consistent with our purpose and values as a business. Business performance The business has shown incredible resilience and agility in the year, with Group sales increasing 7.1% at actual rates. While the costs of responding to the pandemic have been significant, we have strengthened our relationship with customers and built a stronger business for our shareholders. Customer perception of the brand has improved and we had a record year for online, an area where we see great potential for the future. In preparation for Brexit, we worked very hard alongside all suppliers to ensure there would be minimal disruption to our customers. There have been many challenges and we will continue to navigate the changes into the next year but overall, we have maintained strong availability for all our customers in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and across Central Europe. We also completed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia. This has unlocked significant value and allowed us to further simplify and focus the Group. We returned PS5bn of the proceeds to shareholders through a special dividend in February 2021 and made a one-off contribution of PS2.5bn to our pension scheme. This contribution has greatly reduced the prospect of having to make further pension deficit contributions in the future. After the year end, we also completed the sale of our business in Poland to Salling Group. Board changes In October 2020, our former Group Chief Executive, Sir Dave Lewis left the business and handed over to Ken Murphy. Sir Dave guided the business through the challenging turnaround and was unwavering in his commitment to Tesco for over six years. We thank him for his outstanding service. I'm delighted that Ken Murphy has joined the Board as Group Chief Executive. Ken has hit the ground running, leading the business in its response to the ongoing pandemic and delivering a resilient full-year performance. At the end of April, Alan Stewart will retire and we will welcome Imran Nawaz to the Board as Chief Financial Officer. Alan has made an impressive and sustained contribution to Tesco's turnaround, both as CFO and as a Board member. We wish him all the best in his retirement. We recently announced that Deanna Oppenheimer, Mark Armour and Mikael Olsson will retire at this year's AGM. We thank each of them for their invaluable contribution and counsel over many years. Deanna will also step down from her role as Senior Independent Director, to be replaced by Byron Grote. Looking forward, we will welcome Karen Whitworth, Bertrand Bodson and Thierry Garnier to the Board as Non-executive Directors. Thierry will join the Remuneration Committee, Karen will join the Audit Committee and both Bertrand and Karen will join the Corporate Responsibility Committee. They bring with them a broad range of skills and experience and we look forward to benefiting from their valuable perspectives. Looking ahead In the coming months, we will continue to manage the impact of COVID-19 and Brexit, thanks in no small part to the hard work of our colleagues and our great relationships with suppliers. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank everyone at Tesco for going the extra mile this year to build a stronger business and serve shoppers a little better every day. John Allan CBE Non-executive Chairman 13 April 2021 5 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Group Chief Executive's review I am so pleased to be writing my first Annual Report statement as Tesco CEO. Throughout my career across retail and wholesale, I have always admired Tesco. It is a business that truly puts customers first and pushes the boundaries of retail, by following a simple purpose of serving shoppers a little better every day. Since joining the business, I have focused on our response to the immediate challenges of COVID-19 and serving customers through the end of the UK-EU transition period. I have also had the opportunity to meet some of our fantastic colleagues, customers, suppliers, shareholders and other stakeholders, coming to understand the business from the inside and building relationships. I have three initial impressions from my first six months: 1. Throughout the pandemic, colleagues have shown incredible resilience, responding with urgency and compassion to ensure our customers and colleagues stayed safe. Tesco is a business full of people who truly care about what they do. The warmth and passion from people across the business has been inspiring. Tesco is more than a supermarket to our customers. The role we play in our communities and in wider society is essential to maintaining trust and loyalty among those who shop with us. COVID-19 The pandemic has brought challenges to every part of our business, but on a personal level, it has also tested the resilience of our people. We asked our colleagues to step up and be key workers and, putting personal concerns to one side, everyone worked harder than ever in order to serve customers safely. I am incredibly proud of the way colleagues across Tesco have responded, showing a combination of skilful retailing with a sense of purpose and compassion and always putting our customers and communities first. As a business, our approach has been based on four priorities: to provide food for all: safety for everyone: support for colleagues: and support for communities. Food for all Recognising that many of our vulnerable customers were unable to shop in stores, we focused on growing our online business. We increased online capacity in every market, and in the UK we now offer 1.5 million weekly online slots and priority access to more than 850,000 vulnerable customers. Booker's role was invaluable, supporting care homes and providing 100,000 new Click & Collect slots for Tesco customers. In addition, we worked in partnership with our suppliers to maintain availability for our customers across the UK, Ireland and Central Europe and ensured our smallest suppliers were paid immediately. Our teamwork was recognised by suppliers, who named Tesco as the number one retailer for collaboration during a crisis in the 2020 independent Supplier Advantage survey. Safety for everyone It is essential to us that Tesco is a safe place to shop and work and I'm pleased that 90% of UK customers felt safe shopping in our stores, with ratings even higher in Central Europe. We have made significant investments in safety and social distancing measures across every one of our stores in the UK, Ireland and Central Europe, so that people can continue to shop with confidence. In the UK, we created one of the first safety adverts from a food retailer to clearly communicate our new measures with customers. These include limits on the number of customers in store, social distancing signage, sanitising stations, protective screening at checkouts, and face coverings and other protective equipment for colleagues. Support for colleagues We have more than 360,000 colleagues across the Group and they have consistently shown dedication, despite any personal challenges they have faced due to the pandemic. Everyone's circumstances are different but we ensured our most vulnerable colleagues remained at home on full pay when government guidance advised that they should shield. To cover absences and to help meet increased demand, we recruited around 50,000 additional temporary colleagues to ensure there was enough support. Throughout the year, we recognised the contribution of our frontline colleagues, with three separate bonuses. It has also been important to recognise the mental health challenges of this year too, and we made the apps Headspace and SilverCloud available as free support tools to UK colleagues, with similar support tools in all markets. Support for communities We have always done what we can to help our local communities but this year was exceptional. In 2020, we donated more than PS60m worth of meals to UK foodbanks and charities helping those in need in our communities and supporting our partners, FareShare and the Trussell Trust. In Ireland, Tesco donated nearly EU1m in COVID-19 support to local causes nationwide, and in Central Europe, we made our largest ever food donation to food banks in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Tesco Bank increased contactless payment limits, reduced overdraft fees, introduced e-gift cards and offered loan and credit card payment breaks to customers that needed it. Tesco Mobile helped disadvantaged children with their home schooling by offering an extra 20GB of data a month through schools. A year of challenges, leadership and teamwork. 6 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Our business and team As the Chairman reflected in his statement, we have navigated new regulations as a result of Brexit and successfully minimised any disruption for our customers. This is thanks to extensive preparations and contingency planning by our team and a strong partnership with our suppliers. We will continue to prioritise our customers as the situation develops but our business remains agile and resilient to the challenges. In December 2020, we completed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia to CP Group and in March 2021, we completed the sale of our business in Poland to Salling Group. These have been longstanding businesses within the Tesco Group and I am grateful to all the teams for their dedication in serving Tesco customers. Looking forward, I am confident that we have strong positions and opportunities to create value in our markets in the UK, Republic of Ireland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Following the sale of our Asia business, we shared with colleagues the news that Alison Horner has decided to leave Tesco after 22 years with the business. Alison has had a long and successful career at Tesco and we wish her all the best in the future. This year, we also said goodbye to Charles Wilson. Charles joined Tesco in 2018, following the merger with Booker. He is an exceptionally skilled retailer and has managed the 'Joining Forces' of Tesco and Booker seamlessly. We thank him for all he has done, helping to create the UK's leading food business. At the end of April, Alan Stewart will retire as CFO after nearly seven years with Tesco and we will welcome Imran Nawaz to the team. Alan was integral to the turnaround strategy and rebuilding the balance sheet. In his last year, he did not slow down. He launched the first  bond by a retailer globally, reaffirming the Group's commitment to be a net-zero carbon business in the UK by 2035, as well as playing a key role in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals CFO network. I very much look forward to working alongside Imran to build on this fantastic work. As well as Imran, we welcomed Ashwin Prasad to the Executive Committee as Chief Product Officer. Ashwin replaced Andrew Yaxley who has taken on the role of Booker CEO since Charles' retirement. After nearly three years as Group Chief Operating Officer, we are delighted that Tony Hoggett has taken up the new role of Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer for Tesco Group and will develop, mobilise and lead our strategic ambitions aligned to Group-wide goals. Looking forward Tesco is more than a supermarket to our customers. As a business, we have both the scale and the passion to make sure we benefit all those around us. Alongside our Annual Report, we are publishing our Little Helps Plan, which captures our approach to being a responsible and therefore sustainable business. This year, we have made further progress and commitments on tackling carbon emissions, reducing food waste, driving down plastic consumption and supporting a healthier lifestyle for our customers. These topics are important to our customers and colleagues but they are also essential for the long-term sustainability of our business. Despite the challenges we have faced this year, I am confident that the business is in a strong place. Our colleagues remain focused on serving shoppers a little better every day and we continue to make the right decisions for customers, communities and the planet to set us up for success in the future. By looking after our customers, and building on the strong foundations we have created through the pandemic, we will in turn continue to create value for shareholders. Ken Murphy Group Chief Executive 13 April 2021 Colleague hero -- Seema Ishmail Seema Ishmail from our Bury Superstore was nominated for a Retail Week Frontline Hero award for her fantastic community support. At the start of lockdown, Seema shopped for some of our most vulnerable customers who were unable to visit the store themselves. She then started working with charities and care homes to ensure everyone got the food they needed. Seema organised everything herself, contacting charities, segregating stock and organising collections. She has worked tirelessly and become a true hero to her local community. 7 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Our business model Serving shoppers better.

Our sustainability strategy, the Little Helps Plan, ensures we do this in a way that's good for our colleagues, our customers, communities and the planet too. Our values No one tries harder for customers We treat people how they want to be treated Every little help makes a big difference Code of Business Conduct Our Code of Business Conduct is at the heart of how we run our business and helps protect our reputation. It ensures we operate in a responsible manner, doing the right thing for our customers, our colleagues and everybody we interact with. We want to make a big difference. Our presence in thousands of communities, employing hundreds of thousands of people directly and indirectly through our supply chain, and interaction with millions of shoppers every day, gives us unique opportunities to bring about change for the better. This has never been more important as we recover from the global COVID-19 pandemic. At the start of this year, in the face of the pandemic, we prioritised safety, ensuring customers had access to the food they needed, supporting our colleagues and helping the wider community. The Little Helps Plan, through its focus on People, Product, Planet and Places, gave us a clear framework to respond to COVID-19. Our existing partnerships with organisations such as FareShare, the Trussell Trust and the British Red Cross meant we had good foundations in place to support local communities. Our commitments to giving our colleagues the support they need to be at their physical and mental best also ensured we had programmes in place to make a difference. We believe the decisions and actions we have taken this year demonstrate our commitment to a more sustainable future - one in which everyone is made to feel safe and welcome and has access to healthy, sustainable food at an affordable price. 2020 was a milestone year for us, during which we were due to deliver many of our goals, including those on climate action, healthy diets and packaging. Despite the unprecedented challenge posed by the pandemic, we successfully achieved all these goals. People Employment and skills Diversity and inclusion Health, safety and wellbeing Human rights Product Food waste Packaging Healthy sustainable diets Animal welfare Planet Climate change Sustainable agriculture Marine Tackling deforestation Places Supporting communities Food redistribution You can find a full review of our activity, performance and future ambitions in our Little Helps Plan report and at www. We reduced our absolute carbon emissions by over 50%, removed over 50 billion calories through reformulation and permanently eliminated 1 billion pieces of plastic. We were also recognised by numerous external benchmarks. These included the highest ranking of any food retailer in the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark and Oxfam Behind the Barcodes, marking how we continue to lead the way on important human rights issues such as gender equality and sustainable livelihoods. 12 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 COVID-19 support We are proud of our more than 360,000 colleagues who have worked relentlessly throughout the pandemic in service of feeding the nation. Their health, safety and wellbeing have been and continue to be a top priority for us. Alongside the physical safety measures we have taken, we have also stepped up our mental wellbeing support that is helping our colleagues and their families manage COVID-19's impact on everybody's daily lives. In April 2020, we launched two new free digital mental health resources, Headspace and SilverCloud, to colleagues, with almost 30,000 of them making use of Headspace since launch. During Mental Health Awareness Week in May 2020, we launched our first mental health colleague campaign #imhereforyou. This encourages colleagues to reach out to each other and remind everyone that no one is ever alone at Tesco. We followed this campaign with more specific guidance for colleagues working at home. Our colleague-listening programme, Every Voice Matters, helps us gather feedback and implement improvements throughout the year. More than two-thirds of colleagues across the Group took part in our annual survey, and 82% of them told us they think Tesco is a great place to work. Supporting job creation and skills development During the first UK lockdown, we hired nearly 50,000 temporary colleagues to help serve customers when demand was at its highest. Many of these colleagues continue to work with us in newly created roles, including the 20,000 permanent jobs we created to meet increased demand for online deliveries. By investing in young people, we hope to provide many with the opportunity to enter the world of work and build skills at a time when labour markets are tough. For example, we pledged support to the UK Government's Kickstart scheme, offering 1,000 placements. In November we welcomed 900 Kickstart colleagues to our large stores in areas of high youth unemployment across the UK, with the aim of helping them be 'work-ready' at the end of their placement. We also continued to offer work placements to young people not in education, employment or training NEETs through the Movement to Work programme. In the UK, 618 placements took place during the year, with 344 becoming colleagues. Diversity and inclusion We value individuality and uniqueness, and treat everyone fairly and with respect. You can find more information on our approach to diversity and inclusion on page 17. Protecting human rights We are committed to ensuring there is decent, fair, safe work for all, both directly and indirectly throughout our supply chain. Our human rights strategy focuses on four priority areas: sustainable livelihoods: forced labour: worker representation: and gender equality. We have identified risk areas within our own operations and across our supply chain. We work with suppliers, NGOs and other retailers to develop targets and action plans that address the risks. COVID-19 has impacted our ability to undertake physical site visits and audits, however we have continued to support our suppliers and safeguard workers' rights in our supply chain with webinars and virtual due diligence assessments to ensure continued supply chain visibility. Clothing suppliers have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic. From the start of the crisis, we committed to paying for every clothing order that had been completed or was in production. We focused on ensuring garment workers were paid correctly and that health and safety measures and personal protective equipment were in place for workers. As part of our sustainable livelihoods strategy, we started working with our banana suppliers in August, using the IDH Salary Matrix tool to identify gaps between prevailing wages and living wages in key sourcing countries of one of our best selling products. We will be working with producers and the wider industry from 2021 to develop strategies and actions to move towards a living wage in the banana industry. People are at the heart of our business and this has been an incredibly tough year for everyone. Our colleagues went above and beyond, rising to every challenge in the most exceptional circumstances. People We are committed to supporting our clinically extremely vulnerable and high-risk clinically vulnerable colleagues and have ensured they remained at home on full pay during peak lockdown moments following government guidance. For colleagues who became ill with COVID-19 or needed to self-isolate, we ensured they received full pay from the first day of absence. We have also paid recognition bonuses totalling around PS130m, to colleagues across the Group for their hard work throughout the pandemic. 13 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Little Helps Plan continued Product We believe that healthy, sustainable products should be affordable to all. In our Product pillar, we take action to ensure that products are grown, sourced and produced in a sustainable way, embracing new technologies and innovation. Healthy, sustainable food We want to help our customers enjoy a better-balanced diet, and we aim to make the healthy option easy, enjoyable and affordable. That's why we updated our health strategy this year to be better aligned to the UK Eatwell Guide. We aim to improve the healthiness of the average shopping basket by increasing the proportion of healthy products to 65% of volume sold by 2025. We became the first UK supermarket to commit to increasing the sales of plant-based meat alternatives by 300% by 2025. We already have over 350 plant-based meat alternatives on our shelves and we continue to invest in innovation with new plantbased brands joining our incubator programme this year. Alongside our growth in plant-based foods, we have also continued to help our customers eat more fruit and vegetables, with 50% of our ready meals now containing at least one of the recommended 5-a-day, up from 26% in 2018. Through reformulation, we have made thousands of the products our customers enjoy a little healthier by reducing calories, fat, sugar and salt and increasing fruit, vegetable and fibre content. Since 2018, we have removed over 50 billion calories. We are working hard to remove a further 50 billion by 2024. Packaging Packaging plays an important role in protecting products and reducing food waste. Our 4Rs strategy Remove, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle aims to ensure that plastic never finds its way to landfill or into the environment. In December 2020, we announced the permanent removal of 1 billion pieces of plastic from the UK business. Working with our suppliers, we successfully removed plastic from a range of products, including 67 million pieces on tinned multipacks and 24 million pieces on our sausage rolls and slices packaging. By volume, 84% a of our Own Brand packaging is widely recyclable. We are working with partners to address the more challenging soft plastic, installing in-store recycling points to collect plastic from products including bread, crisp and salad bags. Working with reusable packaging specialists Loop, in July we launched an online shopping service that delivers products in reusable packaging. Since the launch we have delivered thousands of orders to customers across the UK, and we are aiming to trial in-store in 2021. Tackling food waste Our fight against food waste calls for action on farms and manufacturing sites, in-store and at home. This year we prevented a higher percentage of good food going to waste than ever before, with 82% of unsold food being given to charities, colleagues or as animal feed in the UK. We were able to do this through our partnership with FareShare, via more than 6,500 local community groups and through the Olio app, which is now redistributing 3% of our unsold food suitable for human consumption. Across the Group, we have reduced food waste by 42% since 2016 17 and are making good progress towards our ambition of halving food waste by 2030. Our suppliers have also stepped up to the food waste challenge, cutting 155,000 tonnes of food waste: 71 suppliers are now publishing their food waste data, including those responsible for over half of fresh food sales in the UK and a third of fresh food sales in Ireland. a In accordance with the producer responsibility obligations we report our recycling performance a year in arrears. KPMG LLP was engaged to provide independent limited assurance over the selected food waste data highlighted in this report with a using the assurance standard ISAE UK 3000. KPMG has issued an unqualified opinion over the selected data. KPMG's full assurance statement is available at: www. com reportinghub Ambitious health commitments In March 2021, we announced new targets to make Tesco the easiest place for customers to shop for affordable, healthy, sustainable food: - increase the proportion of sales of healthy food to 65% by 2025: - make products healthier through reformulation: and - increase the sales of plant-based meat alternatives by 300% by 2025. Further information is available in our Little Helps Plan report. 14 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Planet The health and stability of the natural world goes hand-in-hand with the health and stability of our business - they are two sides of the same coin. As we strive to provide our customers with affordable, healthy, sustainable food, we are also taking action on important issues including climate change and restoring nature. Climate change Climate change is the biggest environmental threat the world faces, and one that poses a challenge to our business and our supply chains. Recognising this, climate change has now been included as a separate principal risk, as set out on pages 33 to 37. We impact the climate in our own operations and through our supply chains, and we have a longstanding commitment to reduce carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. We are also implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD, details of which are set out on pages 26 to 28. In 2020 we committed to fast-track our net zero ambitions for the UK business to 2035, announcing new actions to help tackle our biggest sources of emissions: refrigeration, transport and heating. Actions include switching to CO 2 in refrigeration and trialling alternative heating solutions like heat reclaim. 100% of our electricity is renewable and we are creating additional renewable energy generation for the UK National Grid. One of our projects includes partnering with renewable energy investor, Low Carbon, to create three new solar farms in the UK. In September we became signatories to EV100, the global initiative focused on accelerating the transition to electric vehicles and aim to have a fully electric home delivery fleet by 2028. Despite the unprecedented challenge presented by COVID-19 and the subsequent changes to our operations, most notably the growth in online shopping, our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas GHG emissions across the Group reduced by 10% compared to 2019 20, and by 54% when compared to our 2015 baseline. Halving the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket In 2018, we launched a four-year partnership with WWF, aimed at making it easier for customers to eat more sustainably, restore nature in food production and eliminate waste. In 2019, we jointly launched the Sustainable Basket Metric, a pioneering industry measurement for monitoring progress against the ambition of halving the environmental impact of the average basket. This year, we established our baseline 2018 performance using the 20 sub-metrics contained within the Sustainable Basket Metric, calculating that we are 11% of the way towards our target. We have made progress in many of the areas covered by the Basket Metric, including improvements in tackling food and packaging waste, and encouraging plant-based diets with our commitment to increasing the sales of plant-based meat alternatives by 300% by 2025. ft. of stores and DCs 16.76 22.88 26.53 38.96 a We engaged KPMG LLP to provide independent limited assurance over the greenhouse gas emissions data highlighted in the above table with a using the assurance standards ISAE UK 3000 and 3410. All figures have been restated to reflect the disposal of Thailand, Malaysia and Poland and include the acquisition of Best Food Logistics in the UK as well as minor data improvements. b Our method statement can be accessed at www. We use the market-based method for calculating Scope 2 emissions for our total emissions to account for our efforts in generating and purchasing low-carbon energy. The location-based method is provided for disclosure only and all intensity, net and gross emissions shown are calculated using Scope 2 market-based method. c Under Scope 3 emissions we report business travel and emissions from distribution arranged by Tesco but provided by third parties including secondary distribution globally and emissions from primary distribution in the UK. Scope 3 emissions also include transmission and distribution impacts of electricity and heat supply and well-to-tank embodied impacts of fuel. Further information on our carbon calculations is available at www. Tackling deforestation Preventing deforestation and degradation is critical to a sustainable future. In 2010, we committed to achieving zero net deforestation of our raw materials by 2020. We achieved this goal through certification and have since introduced further targets within our zero deforestation soy transition plan. These include our aim of sourcing 100% of our soy from verified zerodeforestation areas by 2025. 15 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Places Many families are facing hardship due to the pandemic. In April we announced a PS30m package of support for communities in the UK dealing with COVID-19. Building on our five-year partnership with FareShare and the Trussell Trust, we donated an additional PS15m worth of food to community groups and food banks, additional to the estimated PS3m worth of food we donate each month by redistributing surplus food. In total during the year, we provided nearly 29 million meals from stores and distribution centres to charity groups in the UK and 17 million meals in Central Europe. We were also proud to partner with SalutetheNHS. org, donating all the food in a million food parcels for frontline NHS workers. Our customers have also made a massive contribution to communities through our Food Collection events and in-store collection points. In the UK, a total of more than 1.3 million meals were donated this year and in Central Europe 1,000 tonnes of food was donated or collected for food banks in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. We are a member of the Marcus Rashford Child Poverty Task Force, which is campaigning for solutions to end child food poverty in the UK. From November 2020 to March 2021, families who used the weekly Healthy Start Vouchers received a PS1 coupon to spend on fresh and frozen fruit and vegetables at Tesco. We also awarded nearly PS8m of Bags of Help grants during 2020, benefiting more than 10,000 community groups across the UK. In Ireland we supported more than 1,700 good causes through the Community Fund. In Central Europe, we helped 683 local groups with You Choose, We Help grants. Supporting our communities has never been more vital than during the past year, when the ongoing pandemic has affected the lives of so many people. By working with our partners, we are helping thousands of communities. Through our charity partnerships, community grant programmes and colleague and customer fundraising we have donated PS129m this year. Supporting our health charity partners The Health Charity Partnership between Tesco, Cancer Research UK, the British Heart Foundation and Diabetes UK helps people in the UK make sustainable lifestyle changes and adopt healthy habits. Since 2017, we have raised over PS17m for our health charity partners. During the pandemic, our partners faced record levels of demand for their services at the moment their funding was significantly impacted by the cancellation of fundraising events and temporary closure of shops. To support our partners, we held a fundraising appeal across all our UK stores in September 2020. Customers were able to support the appeal by rounding up their shop to the nearest PS1. Over the 13-day in-store appeal, customer donations totalled nearly PS1.5m. Tesco matched contributions to bring the total charity donation to PS3m. Little Helps Plan continued 16 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Diversity and inclusion Diversity and inclusion at Tesco. Everyone's welcome at Tesco Diversity and inclusion have always been at the heart of Tesco. It is embedded in our values: we treat people how they want to be treated. We always want our colleagues to feel they can be themselves at work. We are committed to helping everyone be at their best by creating a sense of belonging and valuing the individuality and uniqueness of our colleagues. Tesco's diversity and inclusion strategy Across the business we will continue to work to create a more diverse and inclusive culture. This will in turn improve performance, better reflect the communities we serve, and enhance engagement among our colleagues, customers and suppliers. Our strategy is underpinned by five colleague networks, who support in the creation of a diverse and inclusive culture where everyone is welcome. The networks being: LGBTQ : Women at Tesco: Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic Network: Armed Forces Network: and Disability Network. Our strategy is formed of three key pillars and related priorities: Becoming data rich Our 'This is Me' campaign asks all colleagues to voluntarily share their diversity data. This will help us better understand the diversity of our workforce, make more informed and inclusive decisions and put plans in place where they are needed most. This data insight will allow us to hold ourselves accountable for progress and track the success of interventions, as well as enabling us to participate in future legislative and voluntary reporting. Inclusive leadership We have defined what inclusive leadership means at Tesco and measure as part of our leaders' performance. We have also developed a series of masterclasses for all Tesco senior leaders. Focusing on bias, race equality and privilege, these are supported by self-led resources to help further build inclusive behaviours across our business. Mentoring In partnership with Arrival Education, our Executive Committee participated in a mentoring programme to support young, diverse talent outside our business. This gave them the inspiration, insight and skills to drive meaningful change in developing socially and ethnically diverse talent within Tesco. We will extend this programme to our business leaders in 2021. Diverse talent development As part of our talent planning processes, we ensure equal opportunities for all colleagues. To help us support young talent more effectively, we have introduced Diverse Talent Communities which are sponsored by our Executive team. Initially, these communities will focus on helping colleagues from minority ethnic backgrounds accelerate their career at Tesco through bespoke career planning, increased visibility and senior sponsorship. We are currently exploring opportunities for supporting colleagues in other underrepresented groups. We are also committed to improving the gender balance across our business and have made a number of external commitments. These include achieving the Hampton-Alexander Review target of having more than 33% female representation at Board and Executive level by 2023. Gender diversity 2020 21 actual year-end headcount Male Female Board of Directors 9 69% 4 31% Senior managers - Directors 330 74% 114 26% Senior managers - Directors and managers 2,371 67% 1,166 33% All employees 169,852 47% 191,919 53% Executive external resourcing and strong internal succession plans play a critical role in enabling and accelerating our ability to meet our diversity and inclusion ambitions. As of March 2021, the overall percentage of female members of the Board, Executive Committee and direct reports to the Executive Committee stood at 31%. Inclusive leadership and diverse talent development Becoming data rich Lead and role model inclusion Listening to and elevating diverse voices Education and support for colleagues and communities Listen, learn, act Consciously inclusive across all colleague touchpoints Fully inclusive people policies Embed inclusion in everything we do Lead and role model inclusion We are proud that 81% 2020: 79% of colleagues feel they can be themselves at Tesco without fear of judgement. This insight acknowledges the positive progress we have made. 2020 has been a challenging year, but we have had the opportunity to truly listen and consider how we can better ensure everyone feels welcome. 17 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report We are continually reviewing key colleague touch points to ensure all colleagues always feel welcome. Over the past year, we focused on: - Resourcing: attracting diverse external talent is essential and our refreshed Careers website now incorporates an augmented writing tool to help ensure that unbiased language is used. We are focused on hiring diversity at a senior level, by working with our partners to demand diverse shortlists. - Onboarding: we aim to ensure that all new starters have an understanding of what inclusion means at Tesco and to make induction content fully inclusive, digital and easy to access. - Policies: we are reviewing all our policies against external best practice. Our family policies for maternity, paternity and adoption now have a minimum standard across the Group, ensuring a consistent experience for colleagues. - Workplace adjustments: we are partnering with a new workplace adjustments provider. We have redesigned and relaunched our approach to workplace adjustments for the UK. Listen, Learn, Act Our Listen, Learn, Act strategy pillar helps us to recognise, celebrate and value our differences. Listen We create opportunities for colleagues to share their views on diversity and inclusion topics. By holding executive-led listening sessions and asking colleagues to share their own experiences, we have been able to better elevate diverse voices. Learn We are focused on using action-orientated colleague learning activities to raise awareness of the importance of inclusion and developing a greater understanding of individual and collective responsibility. Supporting our commitment to change, we have created targeted learning for all colleagues, as well as specific modules for line managers, our People, Resourcing and leadership teams. All managers will go through this learning over the next 12 months, helping them feel empowered and comfortable when talking about difference, and ensuring everyone has an equal opportunity to get on. Act We are committed to taking action within our communities by helping those young people in most need into employment and, increasing the diversity of young talent joining our new intern, apprenticeship and graduate programmes. We have offered 1,000 six-month work placements through the Kickstart government scheme, to long-term unemployed 16-24 year-olds, helping to build the skills they need to become work-ready. More than 45% of the young people joining one of our programmes in 2021 will be from an ethnic minority background. More than 51% are female and more than 17% will be joining us with a disability. Embed inclusion in everything we do External commitments Race equality is a priority for our business. In 2019, we signed the Business in the Community Race at Work Charter and have action plans against its five calls to action. In response to Black Lives Matter in 2020, we were a signatory to The Sunday Times Open Letter. Such external commitments help hold us to account in continuing to create a culture of inclusion. Elevating diverse voices Insight from our 2020 annual colleague satisfaction survey showed that we needed to create more opportunities to better understand our diverse colleagues. As part of our priority to elevate diverse voices within the business, we held several executive-led listening sessions with colleagues from diverse communities, using our established colleague networks as a platform to do so. The sessions focused on understanding the experiences of these groups and what we can do to support them further during their careers at Tesco. We have committed to continuing to hold these listening sessions. The feedback we have captured so far has informed action plans for our colleague networks and future diversity and inclusion initiatives. These include: - Refreshed mentoring resources and activities. - The launch of our Diverse Talent Communities. - New line manager training and on-demand resources.

Prior-year comparatives are also shown on a continuing operations basis. Net debt includes discontinued operations until the point of sale. Further details on discontinued operations can be found in Note 7, starting on page 137. b Group sales exclude VAT and fuel. Sales change shown on a comparable days basis for Central Europe. c Excludes amortisation of acquired intangibles and excludes exceptional items by virtue of their size and nature in order to reflect management's view of underlying performance. d Adjusted Group PBT measures exclude exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments. e Diluted EPS before exceptional and other items adjusted for share consolidation is provided to aid comparability, as the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, and the share consolidation and special dividend which followed, distort our financial result in the year. As such, this metric is presented on a basis other than in accordance with IAS 33 and captures the full impact of the share consolidation as if it had taken place at the start of the 2019 20 financial year. Please see Note 9 on page 139 for a reconciliation to diluted adjusted EPS. f Capex is shown excluding property buybacks. Statutory capital expenditure including property buybacks for the 52 weeks ended 27 February 2021 was PS1.3bn LY PS1.2bn. g Net debt, total indebtedness and retail free cash flow exclude Tesco Bank. Net debt also includes lease liabilities following the adoption of IFRS 16. Detailed below is a summary of our performance for the last financial year. For UK & ROI, the prior year was the 53 weeks ending 29 February 2020. To aid comparability, the headline results and associated commentary is presented on a 52-week comparable basis. The COVID-19 crisis has had a significant effect on these results including substantial incremental costs, a severe decline in the hospitality sector impacting Booker's catering business, a material reduction in Bank profitability and a benefit from additional UK & ROI retail sales. In December, we made a decision to repay business rates relief and the full cost of business rates is therefore included as usual in the relevant profit measures. 19 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Financial review continued Including these impacts, Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was PS1,815m, down 28.1 % at actual rates. Statutory operating profit of PS1,736m includes the impact of PS 79 m exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles. We propose to pay a final dividend of 5.95 pence per Ordinary share, taking the full-year dividend to 9.15 pence per Ordinary share, including the payment of an interim dividend of 3.20 pence per Ordinary share in November 2020. The total dividend for the year is in-line with the prior year and an exception to our policy, reflecting the importance the Board places on dividends paid to shareholders, the strength, resilience and momentum of the business in a truly exceptional year and our confidence in future cash flows. In December 2020, we completed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia for an enterprise value of PS8.2bn and net cash proceeds before tax and other costs of PS8.0bn. The proceeds were used to return PS5.0bn to shareholders via a special dividend and make a PS2.5bn one-off contribution to the pension scheme. In March 2021, we completed the sale of our business in Poland. The performance of our businesses in Thailand, Malaysia and Poland is classified as discontinued operations and has been excluded from our headline performance measures. Segmental results UK & ROI In the UK and the Republic of Ireland ROI, total sales grew by 8.8% as we saw a shift towards 'in-home' consumption. Sales in the first quarter grew by 9.4% due to an initial period of stockpiling at the start of the first national lockdown, before stabilising in the second and third quarters as the 'out of home' market partially reopened. As the UK entered a second and third national lockdown, sales reaccelerated into the fourth quarter and we saw sustained elevated sales throughout this period. Demand was particularly strong in fresh food, grocery and beers, wines and spirits categories across the year. In response to the significant demand peak early in the year, we worked with our supplier partners to simplify our offer, prioritising availability in essential products and categories. We reduced promotional participation from 36% to 21% through the year as we focused on every day great value for customers. We gained market share in the year and gained customers from all key competitors. Our relative performance was particularly strong in the second half, including a market leading performance every week over the Christmas period. We further strengthened and simplified our value proposition, including launching the 'Aldi Price Match' campaign in March 2020 before extending it to over 500 products, including brands. Our value perception accelerated in the second half, reaching its highest level in a decade, up 480 basis points by the end of the year. We extended Clubcard Prices from September, initially offering c. 2,000 exclusive deals to our Clubcard customers. In March 2021, we increased the number of deals available to customers to more than 3,000, now including general merchandise promotions. Since September, the number of customers using their Clubcard via an app has doubled to more than five million and Clubcard sales penetration has increased by more than 10 percentage points to around 80%. Although we have not focused on expanding our Clubcard Plus subscription offer during the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to see an increase in uptake and basket uplifts are significantly ahead of our expectations. Sales grew in every format and channel. Like-for-like sales in large stores grew by 1.5%, with bigger baskets but fewer visits as customers sought to do all of their shopping in one trip. Like-for-like sales in our Express and One Stop stores grew by 3.9% with particularly strong growth in our neighbourhood stores as customers favoured shopping closer to home. In response to the unprecedented increase in customer demand for online groceries, we rapidly expanded our online business, more than doubling capacity to 1.5 million slots per week over a five-week period. Sales grew by 77% in the year - an additional PS2.8bn - taking annual sales to PS6.3bn inc VAT. Online sales participation doubled to 15% for the full year, reaching a peak of 18% during the fourth quarter. Home deliveries accounted for 79% of online orders, with click & collect participation increasing from 11% at the start of the year to 25% by the end of the year. Our first UFC urban fulfilment centre opened in the year in West Bromwich Extra. Our second UFC in Lakeside Extra is now due to open May 2021, having been delayed several months by the pandemic, and a further four sites are due to open within the next twelve months. These UFCs will enable us to provide access to more delivery slots for customers with an increased rate of picking - a scalable, efficient option to fulfil ongoing online demand. Booker sales grew by 10.5%, due to the inclusion of sales from Best Food Logistics which was acquired at the beginning of the financial year. Sales to retail customers were strong, increasing by 18.5%, as we expanded their grocery ranges in response to demand from customers aiming to shop closer to home. In catering, sales declined by 40.8 % due to the closure of the hospitality and leisure sector for much of the year, with monthly performance strongly correlated to the severity of the UK COVID-19 restrictions. We supported our catering customers throughout this period of change, offering a full range of food and consumables, leading to a significantly increased market share at the end of the year. In ROI, sales grew by 13.7% at constant rates driven by particularly strong growth in our large stores. Our online business remains the clear market leader and we increased capacity by over 60% since the start of the year in response to customer demand, with online sales participation increasing from 6% to 9%. By the end of the year, our customer NPS score was at its highest level in over five years as we saw significant improvements in both value and quality perception. UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was PS1,866m, down 13.5 % year-on-year. 20 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 The COVID-19 pandemic had far-reaching impacts on our operations, and we incurred significant costs in safeguarding our customers and colleagues, primarily through higher payroll costs. All colleagues who were off-work due to COVID-19 and those who were required to shield or self-isolate received full-pay from their first day of absence. In recognition of the efforts of our store and distribution colleagues, we awarded three bonuses throughout the year to thank them for their exceptional contribution. We also incurred costs for safety consumables, protective equipment and additional distribution, and the temporary closure of hospitality outlets impacted our retail partners who operate from our stores, leading to a reduction in rental income. In total, UK COVID-19 costs led to a PS 892 m reduction in operating profit, which was partially offset by the contribution from higher sales. In the current year, while we anticipate that the majority of these costs will fall away, a certain proportion are likely to be required due to any ongoing absence and while we operate within national lockdown restrictions. Our current estimate - based on the latest UK Government roadmap for easing restrictions - is for around a quarter of the 2020 21 costs to be repeated. We will continue to forgo any business rates relief available. Booker profitability was significantly impacted by the decline in catering sales, partially offset by a stronger contribution from our retail business and robust cost control. The recovery of catering performance remains uncertain and is likely to be strongly correlated to the reopening of the hospitality and leisure sector. As catering demand fell away immediately following the completion of the Best Food Logistics acquisition, colleagues there were redeployed to support Booker's retail customer-focused business and the Tesco grocery online business. Central Europe In Central Europe customer behaviour was different to that seen in the UK & ROI markets and trading restrictions were highly variable. The smaller 'out of home' market in Central Europe meant we did not see as significant a shift to 'in-home' consumption. Sales declined by 0.6 % at constant rates as customers were encouraged to shop locally and trading restrictions in general merchandise led to a reduction in footfall in our larger, destination stores. Our online business and core food ranges within supermarkets performed strongly throughout the year. Trading regulations are expected to remain challenging into the current year. Central European operating profit before exceptional items reduced by 29.5 % year-on-year, to PS124m, reflecting a challenging trading environment while operating under COVID-19 restrictions, which particularly impacted our most significant large stores channel. We incurred a PS 25 m charge in the year relating to a retail sales tax in Hungary which was introduced in May. As in the UK & ROI, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the region resulted in higher costs due primarily to colleague absence, while mall income was also impacted due to temporary closures. These impacts were partially offset by cost savings from our ongoing simplification efforts in the region. Tesco Bank This year Last year YoY Revenue PS735m PS1,068m 31.2 % Operating profit loss before exceptional items PS 175 m PS193m n m Statutory operating profit loss PS 470 m PS74m 735.1 % Lending to customers PS6,402m PS8,451m 24.2 % Customer deposits PS 5,738 m PS 7,707 m 25.5 % Net interest margin 5.2% 4.1% 1.1%pts Total capital ratio 28.2% 23.1% 5.1%pts The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on performance across the Bank as a material decline in customer spending led to lower levels of new business activity in loans and credit cards, lower credit card balances, and a reduction in ATM and travel money transactions. Higher levels of unemployment and lower GDP forecasts resulted in an increase in the provision for potential bad debts. This, in combination with the reduction in income, resulted in an operating loss of PS 175 m for the full year, compared to a profit in the prior year of PS193m. We also recognised an impairment charge of PS 295 m in relation to goodwill due mainly to an increase in the discount rate as well as a reduction to anticipated future cash flows. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and will continue to impact banking activity levels. Lending to customers declined by 24.2 % and customer deposit balances declined by 25.5 %, driven by lower levels of customer spending and a prudent approach to new credit risk. Lower levels of lending strengthened the Bank's capital position with the total capital ratio increasing to 28.2%, an improvement of 5.1 percentage points year-on-year. The balance sheet remains strong and the Bank continues to have sufficient capital and liquidity to absorb changes in both regulatory and funding requirements. As previously announced, we expect to complete the acquisition of our partner's stake in the Tesco Underwriting joint venture in May. This will create an end-to-end insurance business that is uniquely positioned to help Tesco customers. We supported our customers throughout the year by offering loan and credit card payment breaks to the end of March 2021, increasing contactless payment limits to allow more customers to shop safely, removing administration fees to allow insurance customers to change or cancel policies, reducing overdraft fees and fees related to early access to savings accounts. Our Pay app allows contactless payments of up to PS250 and we now have over one million users. 21 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles in statutory operating profit On a continuing operations basis This year Last year 52-week basis Last year 53-week basis Impairment charge on Tesco Bank goodwill PS 295 m - - Net impairment reversal of non-current assets PS156m PS64m PS64m Acquisition of property joint venture PS134m PS 136 m PS 136 m UK - ATM business rates PS105m - - Litigation costs PS 93 m - - Property transactions PS26m PS22m PS33m Booker integration costs PS 25 m PS 23 m PS 23 m GMP Equalisation PS 7 m - - Employee share scheme PS 4 m - - Net restructuring and redundancy costs - PS 64 m PS 108 m Closure of Tesco Bank current accounts to new customers - PS 56 m PS 56 m Impairment of investment in India joint venture - PS 47 m PS 47 m Provision for customer redress - PS 45 m PS 45 m Disposal of Gain Land associate - PS37m PS37m Tesco Bank mortgage book disposal - PS 5 m PS 5 m Total exceptional items in statutory operating profit PS 3 m PS 253 m PS 286 m Amortisation of acquired intangible assets PS 76 m PS 78 m PS 79 m Total exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles in statutory operating profit PS 79 m PS 331 m PS 365 m Exceptional items are excluded from our headline performance measures, by virtue of their size and nature, in order to reflect management's view of the underlying performance of the Group. On a continuing operations basis, total exceptional items resulted in a charge of PS 3 m, compared to PS 253 m last year. We recognised an exceptional charge of PS 295 m relating to Tesco Bank goodwill due mainly to an increased discount rate as well as an anticipated reduction in future cash flows as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The exceptional credit of PS156m relating to net impairment reversal of non-current assets was driven by a reduction in discount rates across our retail businesses. The acquisition of our partner's 50% stake in The Tesco Property No. 2 Limited Partnership in September 2020 brought into full ownership 12 stores and two distribution centres. The exceptional credit of PS134m represents the net effect of the derecognition of the previously held lease liabilities and right of use assets, and the remeasurement of the acquired assets. A credit of PS105m relates to the refund of historical ATM business rates payments after a Supreme Court ruling in May determined that retailers should not be assessed for rates on ATMs installed in or outside stores. We collected PS90m of these cash refunds in the year, with the balance remaining to be collected in the 2021 22 financial year. A charge of PS 93 m relates to the settlement of two shareholder litigation claims during the period, with associated costs. We have incurred a further PS 25 m exceptional charge related to Booker integration costs, bringing costs to date to PS 61 m, which is in line with our estimate of total integration costs over a three-year period of between PS 50 m to PS 75 m. We do not expect to incur any further exceptional integration costs. Amortisation of acquired intangible assets is excluded from our headline performance measures. We incurred a charge of PS 76 m in the period, which primarily relates to our merger with Booker in March 2018, which resulted in the recognition of goodwill of PS3,093m and PS755m intangible assets. Joint ventures and associates Our share of post-tax profits from joint ventures and associates before exceptional items was PS26m. This includes profits from UK property joint ventures, in addition to an increased contribution from Tesco Underwriting Ltd. The year-on-year improvement also reflects the benefit of the removal of our loss-making associate in China, which we disposed of at the end of last year. Finance income and finance costs On a continuing operations basis This year Last year 52-week basis Last year 53-week basis Net interest on medium term notes, loans and bonds PS 218 m PS 209 m PS 212 m Other interest receivable and similar income PS15m PS20m PS20m Other finance charges and interest payable PS 31 m PS 24 m PS 24 m Finance charges payable on lease liabilities PS 446 m PS 480 m PS 486 m Net finance cost before exceptional charges, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments PS 680 m PS 693 m PS 702 m Fair value remeasurements of financial instruments PS 214 m PS 228 m PS 246 m Net pension finance costs PS 43 m PS 71 m PS 71 m Net finance costs before exceptional items PS 937 m PS 992 m PS 1,019 m Exceptional items: - Fair value remeasurement on restructuring derivative financial instruments - PS 180 m PS 180 m - Gain on Tesco Bank mortgage disposal - PS29m PS29m Net finance costs PS 937 m PS 1,143 m PS 1,170 m Net finance costs before exceptional items, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments were PS 680 m, slightly down on last year. Finance charges payable on lease liabilities reduced year-on-year, primarily due to ongoing lease utilisation and the buyback of property, comprising a further seven UK stores and The Tesco Property No. 2 Limited Partnership in the year. Financial review continued 22 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Statutory basic earnings per share from continuing operations was 7.56p, 0.5 % lower year-on-year, due to a decline in operating profits which was offset by lower exceptional charges and a lower tax charge. Summary of total indebtedness Feb-21 Feb-20 YoY Change Underlying net debt excl. Tesco Bank PS 3,449 m PS 2,765 m PS 684 m Lease liabilities PS 8,506 m PS 9,533 m PS1,027m Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax PS 1,004 m PS 2,573 m PS1,569m Total indebtedness PS 12,959 m PS 14,871 m PS1,912m memo: additional YoY change information of which: relating to Asia disposal of which: underlying movement Underlying net debt excl. Tesco Bank PS 240 m PS 444 m Lease liabilities PS765m PS262m Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax PS2,052m PS 483 m Total indebtedness PS2,577m PS 665 m Total indebtedness was PS 12,959 m, down PS1.9bn year-on-year primarily driven by the reduction in our pension deficit following the PS2.5bn one-off contribution made following the sale of our businesses in Asia. This reduction was partly offset by an increase in the underlying IAS 19 pension deficit. Including the one-off pension contribution, the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia reduced total indebtedness by PS2,577m, including a net benefit of PS525m from the derecognition of cash and lease liability balances. In the memo table above we have shown this impact separately, to provide greater clarity into the other movements in total indebtedness in the year. Other indebtedness movements totalled PS 665 m year-on-year, reflecting an increase in the IAS 19 pension deficit of PS 483 m principally due to underlying market movements in gilts and corporate bonds that have negatively impacted scheme assets but caused smaller offsetting reduction in IAS 19 pension liabilities. The IAS 19 pension deficit does not drive contributions made to the pension scheme. The acquisition of our partner's stake in The Tesco Property No. 2 Limited Partnership also increased indebtedness, with net debt increasing by PS 453 m partly offset by lease liabilities reducing by PS254m. Our reported total indebtedness this year includes PS134m of lease liabilities and PS7m of underlying net debt relating to our business in Poland. We have retained a strong cash position with a total of PS2.1bn of cash liquidity available at the end of the year. In January 2021, we issued a EU750m, 8.5-year bond at an interest rate of 0.375%, linked to greenhouse gas emissions. This was the first bond issued by a retailer to be linked to sustainability targets. We refinanced our committed facilities in October at PS2.5bn for a further three years, securing access to additional liquidity. The rate of interest payable on utilisation of these facilities will be linked to the achievement of three ESG targets. Net interest on medium-term notes, loans and bonds was PS 218 m, PS 9 m higher year-on-year due to the inclusion of interest payments on the debt we acquired with The Tesco Atrato Limited Partnership in September 2019 and The Tesco Property No. This more than offset a reduction in interest payable following debt maturities, bond tenders and new issues at a significantly lower rate of interest. A fair value remeasurement charge of PS 214 m primarily related to premiums paid on the buyback of bonds and the mark-to-market movement on inflation-linked swaps, driven by falling future inflation rates. These swaps reduce the impact of future inflation on the Group's cash flow in relation to historical sale and leaseback property transactions. Net pension finance costs of PS 43 m decreased by PS28m year-onyear, including a benefit from the reduction in the pension deficit following the PS2.5bn one-off pension contribution. Net pension finance costs for the current year are expected to be in the region of PS 23 m. Group tax Tax on Group profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was PS 200 m, PS139m lower than last year primarily due to lower retail operating profits and a tax credit related to Tesco Bank operating losses. The effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles was 22.1%, higher than the UK statutory rate, primarily due to depreciation of assets that do not qualify for tax relief. We expect an effective tax rate for the 2021 22 financial year of c. 23%. Following the UK Government's budget announcement in March, we now expect the effective tax rate to increase to around 26% in the medium term due to an increase in the UK corporation tax rate. Total Group cash tax paid in the year was PS 170 m on a continuing operations basis, which included PS 105 m of tax paid in the UK. Tax paid in the year was PS118m lower than in the prior year, primarily due to a tax deduction in relation to the PS2.5bn one-off pension contribution and a decline in Tesco Bank operating profit. Earnings per share On a continuing operations basis This year Last year 52-week basis Last year 53-week basis Diluted EPS pre-exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles, net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments adjusted for share consolidation 11.94p 18.60p 18.98p Statutory diluted EPS 7.54p n a 7.54p Statutory basic EPS 7.56p n a 7.60p Our adjusted diluted EPS metric reflects the post-consolidation share base as if it had been in place from the start of the 2019 20 financial year. On this basis, adjusted diluted EPS was 11.94p LY: 18.60p, 35.8 % lower year-on-year, due to Tesco Bank operating losses and lower retail operating profits due to COVID-19 impacts. 23 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Our total indebtedness ratio was 3.6 times, compared to 3.1 times at the prior year end, primarily due to a reduction in retail EBITDA driven by COVID-19 related costs. We expect this to improve strongly in the current year as profits recover. The sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia had a net neutral impact on the total indebtedness ratio, as the benefit of the one-off pension contribution and derecognition of lease liabilities and net debt in those businesses was offset by reduced earnings. Fixed charge cover decreased to 2.9 times compared to 3.1 times last year. Summary retail cash flow Retail free cash flow decreased by PS 503 m year-on-year to PS1,187m, driven by lower cash profits due to the significant costs incurred in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, last year's retail free cash flow included PS277m of proceeds from the sale of our 20% stake in the Gain Land associate. We benefited from a working capital inflow of PS450m in the year, which was PS186m higher than last year, primarily driven by the effect of higher food volumes. We saw a significant reduction in fuel volume in the year, leading to a c. PS 180 m impact in working capital, however this was offset by a planned change to our fuel supplier payment terms. Interest paid related to net debt exc. lease liabilities of PS 226 m was up PS 13 m year-on-year as the benefit of bond buybacks and refinancing at lower rates of interest was offset by the impact from borrowings acquired as part of The Tesco Property No. Retail cash tax paid was PS 161 m, PS58m lower than last year, primarily as a result of lower retail operating profits. Property proceeds of PS181m includes PS90m from properties in Poland which were sold separately to the sale of the business to Salling Group A S, as well as other smaller disposals including the sale of the Booker Makro site in Croydon. We announced the completion of the sale of our business in Poland to Salling Group A S in March 2021, following the end of the 2020 21 financial year. We utilised PS 291 m of cash to buy back stores in the UK, including PS 238 m to buyback seven standalone stores which will result in an annual cash rental saving of PS14m. We also acquired our partner's share in The Tesco Property No. 2 Limited Partnership at a cost of PS 54 m, bringing back into 100% ownership 12 stores and two distribution centres, which had been subject to fixed rental uplifts each year. This acquisition results in initial annual cash rental savings of PS28m. We continue to evaluate store buyback opportunities on an individual lease basis and will use capital for this purpose where it is economically attractive. We purchased PS 66 m of shares in the market to offset dilution from the issuance of new shares to satisfy the requirements of share schemes. This was PS83m lower than the prior year due to a reduced volume of share scheme maturities in the year.

Our capital expenditure for the year was PS1,015m, PS88m higher year-on-year, primarily due to higher maintenance spend in our UK stores and technology, including our investment in online capacity. In the UK & ROI, we opened 28 convenience stores, one superstore and one urban fulfilment centre in West Bromwich. Financial review continued 24 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 We continue to expect annual Group capital expenditure of between PS0.9bn-PS1.2bn in future years. Statutory capital expenditure of PS1.8bn includes PS0.5bn relating to the buyback of seven UK stores and The Tesco Property No. 2 Limited Partnership comprising 12 stores and two distribution centres referred to above. This year Last year UK & ROI PS875m PS774m Central Europe PS85m PS101m Tesco Bank PS55m PS52m Group PS1,015m PS927m Property The estimated market value of our fully owned property as at the year end increased by PS0.9bn to PS17.9bn. The market value of PS17.9bn represents a surplus of PS1.4bn over the net book value. Our Group freehold property ownership percentage, by value, has increased by 1% year-on-year to 58%. In September we completed the purchase of our partner's 50% stake in The Tesco Property No. 2 Limited Partnership, bringing back into full ownership 12 stores and two distribution centres. This acquisition contributed to a 2% increase in the percentage of fully owned properties in the UK & ROI and will deliver an annual cash rental saving of PS28m. We also repurchased seven further stores in the UK, with an annual cash rental saving of PS14m. In Central Europe, we released PS90m of value through the disposal of properties in Poland in the year. Dividend In February, we returned PS5.0bn to shareholders by means of a special dividend, following the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia. The proposed full-year dividend of 9.15p reflects the importance the Board places on dividends paid to shareholders, the strength, resilience and momentum of the business in a particularly challenging year and our confidence in future cash flows. This is an exception to our policy of a pay-out ratio of 50% of earnings which would have implied a full year dividend of 5.97p. The proposed final dividend was approved by the Board of Directors on 13 April 2021 and is subject to the approval of shareholders at this year's Annual General Meeting. The final dividend will be paid on 2 July 2021 to shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on 21 May 2021 the record date. Shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividend in the dividend reinvestment plan DRIP. The last date for receipt of DRIP elections and revocations will be 11 June 2021. Discontinued operations The performance of our businesses in Thailand, Malaysia and Poland are classified as discontinued operations and has been excluded from our headline performance measures. Operating profit before exceptional items for discontinued operations was PS432m. In December, we completed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia to a combination of CP Group entities for an enterprise value of PS8.2bn and net cash proceeds before tax and other costs of PS8.0bn. In March 2021, we announced the completion of the sale of our business in Poland to Salling Group A S. Total exceptional items related to discontinued operations were PS 147 m in the period, comprising a provision for a legal claim of PS 88 m relating to the sale of our Homeplus business in Korea in 2015 and a PS 43 m charge relating to net impairment losses on non-current assets in our business in Poland. Looking ahead We will continue to be guided by our four key priorities in response to the COVID-19 crisis: providing food for all, safety for everyone, supporting our colleagues and supporting our communities. We also remain committed to delivering great value to help customers in challenging times. While we expect some of the additional sales volumes we have gained this year in our core UK market to fall away as COVID-19 restrictions ease, we expect a strong recovery in profitability and retail free cash flow as the majority of the additional costs incurred as a result of the pandemic in the 2020 21 financial year will not be repeated. While the greater than usual level of uncertainty around sales volumes, mix and channel shift makes it difficult to be precise, our best estimate at this stage is for retail operating profit to recover to a similar level as in the 2019 20 financial year on a continuing operations basis - the year prior to COVID-19 having any impact on performance. We anticipate a return to profitability in Tesco Bank in the 2021 22 financial year. The pace and scale of recovery in profitability is highly dependent on the economic outlook, which remains uncertain. Imran Nawaz takes over as Chief Financial Officer on 1 May 2021, following Alan Stewart's retirement on 30 April 2021. We remain committed to maintaining capital discipline and returning excess capital to shareholders. 25 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures We recognise climate change as the biggest environmental threat the world faces, posing particular risks to our business and supply chains. We impact the climate in our own operations and supply chain. We continue to develop our work on climate change and include information on this in several sections of this year's reporting. In addition to this TCFD report, we provide additional information in principal risks and uncertainties and our Little Helps Plan report. We also consider the potential financial impacts from climate change in the viability statement on page 38 and the impairment note on page 147, based on our initial phase of scenario modelling which is described below. Strategy In June 2017, Tesco publicly committed to implementing the TCFD recommendations. In 2018, we conducted a materiality assessment in consultation with relevant climate experts across the business. Our assessment prioritised the key business categories based on contribution to Group sales with the greatest potential climate-risk exposure, based on consideration of factors including the complexity and locations of supply chains for different products. Across the financial years 2018 19 and 2019 20, we carried out initial scenario analysis for the produce and animal protein categories as well as our UK property estate, which represents the vast majority of our Group space. In the current year, we included the grocery and prepared foods categories as well as soy, a key commodity in animal feed. Risks assessed included impacts of severe weather events, chronic weather changes and climate transition e. g. policy changes, reputational risks, market shifts, etc.. To date, our scenario analysis has focused on the trading impacts of climate change in our largest market, the UK, and we used the results to prioritise our areas of focus. This initial phase of scenario modelling does not quantify the mitigating actions which we would look to implement to address and minimise the adverse impacts from climate change. The modelling is intended to provide illustrative examples of the areas of the business which could be most exposed to the effects of climate change. Looking ahead, we plan to expand our initial analysis beyond trading impacts to cover further potential risks and opportunities, e. g. those relating to capital investment, technology and people as well as additional product categories. Our current climate risk assessment methodology assesses the risks and opportunities we may face in 2030 as a meaningful medium-term timeframe for risks and opportunities to emerge, and to reflect our typical business planning cycles. We will look to expand this to include both shorter and longer timescales. We assessed risks and opportunities in 2030 under a 4-degree scenario and a 2-degree scenario. Our scenarios were developed in 2018, based on those developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC. The 4-degree scenario focuses on systemic failure to address climate change. It assumes limited policy or regulatory support for decarbonisation and focuses on several significant physical climate risks: chronic climate change, leading to reduced agricultural productivity in some regions, raising prices of raw materials or reducing supply volumes: and increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, disrupting our supply chain or causing damage to our assets. The 2-degree scenario focuses on a world which rises to the challenge of tackling climate change and limits global warming to below 2degC. This scenario focuses on transition risks associated with the rapid changes needed by 2030 to cut emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, including: carbon pricing and low-carbon land management practices, increasing manufacturing and raw-material costs: and changes in consumer behaviour and consumption patterns, leading to potentially significant changes in demand for certain product categories. Tesco's business strategy provides a degree of resilience to some of these risks, particularly the physical risks. For example, our diversified supply chain approach helps to provide some resilience to the impacts of climate change on particular areas: and our large physical store footprint, national reach and multi-channel business provide some resilience to potential local flooding hotspots. Scenario analysis results and mitigations The table opposite describes the potential modelled impacts from the animal protein and UK property business areas, based on our initial phase of scenario modelling. This analysis is provided as an illustrative example of the potential effect of climate change on our business. The financial impacts are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for modelling, and are quantified in the table below as the potential annual profit impact we could face as a business each year by 2030, before we take any mitigating actions. The impacts described are those arising from potential regulatory changes e. g. a carbon tax on livestock emissions and carbon pricing policies. Given that the initial analysis showed the other impacts to be less material to Tesco, and noting the potential for significant variation depending on the assumptions used, we have not separately quantified the smaller impacts. Our scenario modelling is underpinned by several key assumptions, principally that the assessed risks are based on a scenario before we take actions to mitigate the modelled impacts. The modelled risks under the 2-degree and 4-degree scenarios are mutually exclusive: we have not assessed a situation where physical and transition risks occur in parallel. The first iteration of our scenario modelling assumes the business remains static, including our operating model, current sourcing practices and sourcing volumes. Finally, we assume that the potential costs from climate-related risks are fully absorbed by the business, with no pass-through to our customers. Animal protein Our animal protein assessment focused on beef, chicken, lamb, pork and milk in key sourcing countries: the UK, Ireland and New Zealand. Our assessment under the 2-degree scenario included analysis of how regulation and fiscal measures including taxation may be employed in future to promote a low carbon transition in livestock production. Beef accounted for the largest financial impact identified due to its high carbon footprint per unit of production. Milk and chicken also had significant impacts due to the large volumes sourced. The UK and Ireland were particular risk hotspots due to the high volume of beef and milk sourced there. Transitioning to a low-carbon economy will probably require changes in consumer diets. Meat and dairy production uses 70% of agricultural land and emits 14.5% of greenhouse gases globally. Growing public concern for the environment is expected to drive 26 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Category 2-degree scenario 'transition risks' Animal protein The potential cost of any carbon tax on livestock emissions is calculated based on an externally sourced estimated carbon price and historical sourcing volumes, with the largest impacts from beef, milk and chicken - potential operating profit impact of c. PS 150 -PS 200 m annually by 2030 before mitigating actions. Property Higher compliance costs due to more stringent carbon pricing policies, calculated based on an externally sourced estimated carbon price applied to our Scope 1 emissions - potential operating profit impact of c. PS 50 -PS 100 m annually by 2030 before mitigating actions. Extreme weather can impact stores by disrupting operations by damaging assets or increasing running costs, and through loss of sales due to closure or transport disruption. While the results showed elevated flood risk to stores by 2030, the financial impacts were not considered significant. Produce Our produce assessment focused on 20 types of fruits and vegetables sourced from six countries. Results indicate physical climate risks in our produce supply chain, and some potential opportunities for further investigation. Long-term changes in temperature and rainfall patterns will adversely impact production by 2030. The most impacted countries assessed will be South Africa, Egypt, Spain and Peru. Higher UK temperatures and rainfall by 2030 could support a longer growing season, potentially increasing yield for certain crops if other growing conditions are also favourable. However, there would need to be significantly higher demand for this to translate into increased revenue. Changing agricultural farming practices and land use were identified as key risks under the 2-degree scenario, potentially impacting production costs by 2030. While the potential direct financial impact on our produce supply chain may not be major, impact on product quality and availability could be, and mitigating these risks requires cross-industry and public policy action. As part of our sustainable agriculture strategy, we are strengthening supplier requirements across areas including biodiversity, soil health, emissions reduction and water management. Soy The main use of soy is as animal feed 75% of global production due to its nutritional benefits. As the world population increases, so too will the global demand for meat and other animal proteins. The associated increasing demand for animal feed is driving an expansion of soy cultivation, leading to the loss of native vegetation in South America's Amazon and Cerrado regions. Tesco primarily sources soy feed from South America. The assessment findings identified that local political uncertainties may give rise to continuous deforestation and infringement of indigenous rights in the region. Alternative sources of soy have less protein content, potentially impacting livestock production, poultry in particular. More soy may therefore be required to meet production volumes. Tesco is committed to zero-net deforestation in our sourcing of soy. Our UK soy strategy goes beyond certification to a commitment to source from verified zero-deforestation areas by 2025. We are also supporting the development of alternative animal feed proteins, such as insects. Beyond our supply chain, we work collectively at an industry level and with other stakeholders such as NGOs and governments, recognising that developing a sustainable soy market requires effective collaboration. Tesco is actively engaged in all relevant industry initiatives, including the Consumer Goods Forum CGF, Forest Positive Coalition of Action, Soy Transparency Coalition and the UK Roundtable on Sustainable Soya. We are also co-chair of the SoS for the Cerrado Manifesto. a shift in demand from animal-based to plant-based proteins. Research conducted in 2020 found that 70% of Tesco customers are actively trying to reduce their intake of meat, while 80% want supermarkets to do more to help, including offering healthier and more sustainable options. We are adapting our product portfolio accordingly. In September 2020, we became the first UK retailer to set a sales target for plant-based meat alternatives, committing to a 300% increase in sales by 2025. In parallel, we are shaping our sustainable diets strategy to reflect the role of plant-based protein alongside 'less and better' meat, including early-stage trials on alternative sources of feed. This falls under our ambition of delivering healthy, sustainable and affordable food for all. Property Our property assessment focused on our UK estate. Results identified changing regulation and fiscal measures and extreme weather events as having potential impacts on our business. Under the 2-degree scenario, robust carbon taxes could lead to higher compliance costs. To mitigate this risk, Tesco continues to invest in renewable energy, energy efficiency and new technologies to monitor energy use. We already use 100% renewable electricity across the Group. We continue to increase sourcing via power purchase agreements PPAs, including a new partnership with Low Carbon, which generates new renewable electricity and helps to green the National Grid. We are replacing retired assets, including fridges, with more efficient models, installing doors and aerofoil in all stores, and exploring heat-retention systems for recycling refrigerant energy. 27 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Grocery and prepared foods We selected 15 key ingredients of our biggest-selling grocery or prepared foods products for our grocery and prepared foods category assessments. Results identified extreme weather events and changing regulation and fiscal measures as the drivers of potential impacts, all of which were financially relatively small. Changing temperatures and precipitation in certain countries can improve or damage growing conditions for raw ingredients, having a knock-on effect on their availability. However, we found the associated financial impacts not to be significant, given the diversity of sourcing origins for most ingredients. Our sustainable agriculture strategy not only helps to build supply chain resilience and embed sustainable production practices within changing landscapes, it also helps secure the sustainable supply of ingredients for the future. Risk management The identification and management of climate change risks follow our established risk-management process, of which the key elements are set out on page 31. During the year, we assessed and evaluated risks relating to climate change as part of the review cycle, and they were discussed by the Executive and Audit Committee. As shown on page 32 this assessment concluded climate change was a standalone principal risk previously managed within the responsible sourcing and supply chain risk and the brand, reputation and trust risk. As a principal risk, climate change has been assigned an Executive Risk Owner, the Chief Product Officer. It will be monitored by the Executive and Audit Committee to ensure it is embedded in strategic decision-making. The Executive Committee will also oversee its effective management and mitigation through our policies, processes, practices and performance, a summary of which is set out on page 34. You can also find consideration of the key financial risks associated with climate risk in our viability scenario analysis on page 38 and on our annual impairment testing process on page 147. Governance The Corporate Responsibility CR Committee is our Board-level body responsible for overseeing the Group's social and environmental obligations as outlined within the Little Helps Plan LHP, our sustainability framework, including those relating to climate change. The Committee currently meets three times each year and receives regular updates on our LHP commitments and performance. This year, the CR Committee received an update on TCFD, broader business updates on the LHP, and standing updates on emerging external trends and developments. From 2021 22 onwards, the CR Committee will consider climate-related risks as a standing agenda item and will be attended by colleagues from our product function, recognising the area's strategic importance. As discussed above, the Chief Product Officer will be the Executive Risk Officer for climate change. He will lead the policy development of the climate change agenda and bring additional executive oversight to this important strategic issue. Updates will be tabled for discussion at the Executive and Audit Committees in line with our risk review cycle. The Chief Financial Officer will maintain oversight of our climaterelated financial activities and reporting, sponsoring the TCFD working group that includes colleagues across our climate, risk management and finance teams to maintain day-to-day oversight of these areas. Metrics and targets In May 2017, Tesco announced science-based climate targets for our own operations and supply chain. Our operational targets are aligned with the Paris Agreement's aspiration to limit global warming to 1.5degC. We surpassed our 2020 Group target to reduce absolute emissions from our operations by 35% vs 2015 16 levels, achieving -37% in FY 2019 20, or -50% rebaselined for continuing operations. We are on target to meet our further reduction targets of 60% by 2025 and 100% by 2050 2035 for our UK operations. We have met our 2030 target of sourcing 100% of our Group electricity from renewable sources 10 years early. Our science-based climate change targets for our supply chain include explicit targets for manufacturing and agricultural suppliers - recognising the different approaches required to reduce emissions in both areas. We are currently reviewing opportunities to expand our work on scope 3. Our carbon reporting follows the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and is third-party verified by KPMG. Our climate change metrics and other environmental targets are disclosed in our full LHP report available on our website. In December 2020, we completed an updated carbon footprint analysis across our UK business using the latest available emissions factors and requirements. This data enables us to determine more granular emissions profiles across our product categories to inform our strategy and risk-management process. We are currently undertaking a review of our science-based targets to further strengthen our decarbonisation roadmap and the metrics we use to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. We are also considering any further metrics to help monitor our progress in managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Next steps As described above, our priorities for the year ahead include expanding our scenario analysis to impacts beyond trading and to shorter and longer timescales, and further embedding our considerations of climate-related risks and opportunities into our business activities, including measuring our progress.

We trained 1,000 community cooks in 2019, and a further 300 joined a virtual launch of this year's programme, which will run throughout June with different lessons and recipes to learn. Non-financial reporting statement Photograph taken before COVID-19 restrictions were put in place. 29 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Strategic report Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 requires a director of a company to act in the way he or she considers, in good faith, would most likely promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole while having regard, among other matters, to a range of factors set out in section 172 1 a - f in the Companies Act 2006. In discharging our section 172 duty, we have regard to these factors by taking them into consideration when decisions are made. Details of our key stakeholders are set out on pages 8, 9 and 52. In addition, the interests and views of Tesco pensioners and our relationship with regulators and NGOs are taken into consideration.

Tesco's response to COVID-19 When the pandemic started, while the financial and risk impact to the business was tracked, the Board made a conscious decision to prioritise: - Food for all: we increased stock levels, limited purchases, secured availability in the supply chain and changed our shopping hours: - Safety for everyone: we introduced social distancing measures, expanded home delivery and Click & Collect capacity and introduced priority slots for the vulnerable: - Support for colleagues: introduced full pay for our vulnerable colleagues and those who were unwell or required to self-isolate, recruited around 50,000 temporary colleagues which saw over 1 million visitors to our careers website, supported our office colleagues with the ability to work at home and provided additional support for colleagues' mental health and wellbeing: and - Support for communities: we donated 29 million meals from stores and distribution centres, donated PS129m to good causes through our charity partnerships, community grant programmes and colleague and customer fundraising, and PS8m awarded through our Bags of Help grants, benefiting more than 10,000 community groups in the UK. Senior management have liaised with the relevant authorities, monitored safety advice and communicated widely within the Group to ensure the safety of our colleagues, customers and other stakeholders. Through updates from all business areas, the Board had visibility of the challenges faced in all markets, changes required in the way we operated to ensure safety and deliver on our four priorities, support our suppliers and understand the financial impact the pandemic was having on all areas of the business including Tesco Bank and Booker. Stakeholder reaction to our response has very been positive, with around 90% of UK customers rating safety highly. Repayment of business rates relief The Government's business rates relief, announced in March 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic, allowed the Group immediately to continue to operate in the face of significant uncertainty, to invest in colleagues and support our customers and suppliers. For food retailers, the impact was immediate and potentially disastrous: panic buying, severe pressure on supply lines, major safety concerns and the risk of mass absences from work culminated in a real and immediate risk to the ability of supermarkets to feed the nation. Every penny of the business rates relief received was spent in our response to the pandemic and the Group incurred more than PS892m in UK retail COVID-19 costs to support colleagues and customers to put safety first. In December, the Board made the decision to repay the business rates relief to the Government and the devolved administrations. In making its decision, the Board considered the short-term financial consequences, together with the long-term benefits to the Group across all aspects of the business to benefit all stakeholders. The Board considered the negative financial impact this would have on the Group including the material amount of business rates to be repaid, the impact this would have on the liquidity of the Group and the potential dividend impact on shareholders. The Board recognised that it was its responsibility to act with integrity, in the manner of a good corporate citizen doing the right thing as would be expected by our customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders, particularly in light of the financial difficulties many industries were facing. Further detail on the Board's activities during the year are set out on pages 54 to 57. 30 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Assessing the Group's longer-term prospects and viability The Directors have based their assessment of viability on the Group's current long-term plan, which is updated and approved annually by the Board. The plan delivers the Group's purpose of serving shoppers a little better every day and is underpinned by a clear strategic focus on driving sustainable and profitable growth. The Group conducts an annual strategic planning process, comprising a comprehensive reassessment of progress against the Group's strategic objectives, alongside an evaluation of the longer-term opportunities and risks in each market in which the Group operates. The process for identifying the principal and emerging risks in each market is an important input to this process. The Group's strategic planning and viability statement are both considered over a three-year period, as this time horizon most appropriately reflects the dynamic and changing retail environment in which the Group operates. Long-term planning process The long-term planning process builds from the Group's current position and considers the evolution of the strategic objectives over the next three years. As part of this, a longer-term assessment of the prospects of the Group is also considered. Current position The priority for the Group in the past year has been responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a primary focus on safeguarding customers and colleagues by providing food for all, safety for everyone, supporting our colleagues and supporting the communities in which we operate. Following the successful delivery of every part of our turnaround plan in the prior year, the Group entered this period in a strong position, both financially and operationally, enabling the creation of long-term and sustainable value for our key stakeholders. The Group continues to invest in delivering great value to help customers in increasingly challenging times, supported by: - A strategic focus on driving growth and continued focus on cost reduction from simplification of the operating model. - A clear set of financial priorities to deliver cash profit, free cash flow and earnings per share growth, underpinned by a robust capital allocation framework. - A diversified business portfolio covering retail, wholesale, banking and data science. Refer to the Group Chief Executive's review on pages 6 and 7 and the financial review on page 19 for further detail regarding the Group's strategic and financial progress. Longer-term prospects The following factors are considered both in the formulation of the Group's strategic plan, and in the longer-term assessment of the Group's prospects: - The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, as well as emerging risks as they are identified, and the Group's response to these. - The prevailing economic climate and global economy, competitor activity, market dynamics and changing customer behaviours. - The ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, including structural changes in how customers shop, costs incurred by the Group in safeguarding customers and colleagues and the potential macroeconomic consequences of rising unemployment. - The potential short and longer-term economic impact of Brexit - Opportunities for further cost reduction through operational simplification and leveraging technology. - The resilience afforded by the Group's operational scale. Assessing the Group's viability The viability of the Group has been assessed, considering the Group's current financial position, including external funding in place over the assessment period, and after modelling the impact of certain scenarios arising from the Group's principal risks outlined on pages 33 to 37. Five 'severe but plausible' scenarios have been modelled that address the principal risks that the Group has assessed would have the most direct and material impact on the Group. None of these scenarios, either individually or in aggregate, threaten the viability of the Group. We expect to be able to refinance external debt and renew committed facilities as they become due, which is the assumption made in the viability scenario modelling. The scenarios opposite are hypothetical and purposefully severe with the aim of creating outcomes that could threaten the viability of the Group. In the case of these scenarios arising, various options are available to the Group in order to maintain liquidity to continue in operation, such as: i accessing new external funding early: ii short-term cost reduction actions: and iii reducing capital expenditure. None of these mitigating actions are assumed in our current scenario modelling. Longer-term viability statement 38 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 Scenario Associated principal risk description Description Macroeconomic downturn - Competition and markets - Customer - Brand, reputation and trust The macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been severe, causing business failure, increased unemployment, reduced disposable income and lower levels of consumer confidence. A reduction in disposable income results in a contraction in customer demand, driving like-for-like volume decline across our retail businesses. To maintain our competitive position in such a recessionary environment, further investment in our value proposition will be required, putting pressure on margins. Brexit - Competition and markets - Political, regulatory and compliance - Brexit Considers the trading agreement between the UK and European Union, which largely mitigates our exposure to tariffs levied on imports from the EU. A broad assessment of the remaining potential impact has been modelled, including higher sourcing costs, higher labour costs in our value chain driven by domestic cost of goods inflation and migration of labour out of the UK and potential cost of customs friction from border controls. COVID-19 - Customer - COVID-19 Allows for a six-month period of lockdown restrictions in the UK, in spring 2021 and winter 2022, should infection rates increase or a new strain of the COVID-19 virus emerge. In the modelling, the Group considers the potential impact on retail and wholesale sales and the operating cost impact of actions taken to safeguard customers and colleagues. The Bank has modelled the ongoing impact of a macroeconomic downturn, and the effect on expected credit losses on its lending book. The Bank has sourced macroeconomic forecasts from a third-party provider and has used this input to assess the adequacy of capital and liquidity in place to support the business through the expected downturn. Climate change - Climate change - Responsible sourcing and supply chain - Political, regulatory and compliance Rising global temperatures results in an increasing incidence and severity of extreme weather events, leading to a higher incidence of store closures due to flooding and disruption to our global supply chain, predominantly in the produce and animal protein categories. A fuller assessment of the climate-related risks the Group faces, and our actions to mitigate these risks is provided in the TCFD section, starting on page 26. Data security or regulatory breach - Brand, reputation and trust - Data security and data privacy - Political, regulatory and compliance A serious data or security breach results in a significant financial penalty and a loss of reputation among customers. The modelling of this scenario is approached via a 'reverse-stress test' given the inherent uncertainty of value. This assesses a risk in the context of the residual headroom after all other downside scenarios have been applied. Viability statement Based on these severe but plausible scenarios, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period considered.

      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE": "- The company's **Return on Equity (ROE)** has significantly deteriorated, dropping from approximately **49.77%** in the previous year to about **9.60%** in the current year.  \n- This sharp decline indicates a substantial reduction in the efficiency with which the company is using shareholders' equity to generate profits.  \n- The annual report highlights a strong increase in **adjusted operating profit** and **adjusted diluted EPS**, yet the ROE contraction suggests that equity capital has grown disproportionately or net income attributable to shareholders has been affected by other factors.  \n- The company reduced **net debt** by \u00a31.4bn and achieved strong **retail free cash flow** growth, but also underwent significant **property buybacks** and acquisitions, which may have increased equity base or impacted net income volatility.  \n- **Adjusting items** such as litigation costs and restructuring charges, as well as changes in accounting policies (e.g., property buybacks under IFRS 16), could have impacted net income and thus ROE.  \n- The **pension surplus** increased, which reduces net liabilities and boosts equity, potentially diluting ROE despite improved profitability.  \n- The report projects **retail adjusted operating profit** of \u00a32.4bn to \u00a32.6bn for FY 2022-23, suggesting some recovery in profitability, but ongoing inflationary pressures and cost increases may constrain margin improvement.  \n- Given ongoing investments in **online expansion** and **capital expenditure**, along with restructuring costs, short-term ROE improvement may be limited.  \n- The company\u2019s commitment to **share buybacks** and a **progressive dividend policy** indicates a focus on shareholder returns, which may support ROE recovery over the medium term.  \n- Overall, while operational performance shows strength, the current equity base and accounting adjustments have pressured ROE, and the trend is unlikely to fully reverse in the next quarter but may improve over the next year with sustained profitability and capital management.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE Driver": "- **Asset Turnover** declined from 5.67 to 5.19, indicating a **reduction in asset efficiency** year-over-year. This suggests the company generated slightly less revenue per unit of assets, potentially signaling overinvestment or slower asset utilization.\n- **Profit Margin** dropped sharply from 10.61% to 2.45%, reflecting a significant **weakening in profitability** despite revenue growth. This indicates higher costs, margin compression, or extraordinary expenses impacting net income relative to sales.\n- The drastic decline in **profit margin** is a more dominant driver negatively affecting ROE compared to the moderate decline in asset turnover.\n- The annual report highlights **inflationary pressures, increased operating costs, and investments in value and service** which likely contributed to margin compression.\n- Despite margin pressure, the company reported strong **sales growth (6.0%)** and improved **adjusted operating profit (+58.0%)**, suggesting operational improvements but with increased costs reducing net profitability.\n- The weakening asset turnover may be influenced by **higher capital expenditure (up 8.5%)** and investments in online and convenience channels, temporarily reducing asset productivity.\n- Tesco\u2019s **strategic priorities** emphasize improving operational efficiency (\u201cSave to Invest\u201d) which could stabilize or improve asset turnover over the next year.\n- Profitability is expected to face ongoing **inflationary and cost challenges in the near term**, but planned **cost savings (~\u00a31bn over 3 years)** and focus on value may support margin recovery.\n- Growth in **online operations and convenience stores** may initially pressure asset turnover but support longer-term revenue diversification.\n- Overall, the **profit margin deterioration is the primary drag on ROE**, while asset turnover decline is moderate; management\u2019s efficiency and cost-saving initiatives are critical to reversing these trends going forward.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of Risk": "- **Gearing ratio** has decreased from 2.41 to 1.93, indicating a reduction in financial leverage and **lower financial risk**.\n- **Current and quick ratios** have improved, with the current ratio rising from 0.65 to 0.73 and quick ratio from 0.24 to 0.29, suggesting **enhanced short-term liquidity** and better ability to meet immediate obligations.\n- **NLP financial risk** increased slightly from 1.22 to 1.31, signaling a marginal rise in perceived financial risk, but this is offset by improved liquidity and gearing.\n- **NLP legal risk** dropped significantly from 0.57 to 0.07, reflecting a **substantial reduction in legal uncertainties** and potential liabilities.\n- **NLP tax risk** also decreased from 0.87 to 0.81, indicating a modest reduction in tax-related risk exposure.\n- **NLP specificity** improved from 0.09 to 0.11, showing that the company\u2019s risk disclosures have become **more detailed and precise**, enhancing transparency.\n- The **average sentence length** remained stable (~26.7 words), while **sentence depth** slightly increased from 6.54 to 6.58, suggesting a minor rise in linguistic complexity.\n- The stable sentence length combined with higher specificity indicates **more thorough, yet clear reporting**, likely aiding investor understanding without excessive obfuscation.\n- The reduction in legal and tax risks, coupled with improved liquidity and lower leverage, signals a **strengthening overall risk profile**.\n- Going forward, the company appears well-positioned to **manage and potentially reduce risks further**, although minor financial risk increases should be monitored.",
      "summary": "- The company\u2019s **Return on Equity (ROE)** sharply declined from **49.77% to 9.60%**, driven primarily by a significant drop in **profit margin** from **10.61% to 2.45%**, despite strong **sales growth (6.0%)** and improved **adjusted operating profit (+58.0%)**.  \n- A moderate decrease in **asset turnover** from **5.67 to 5.19** also contributed to ROE pressure, reflecting slightly lower **asset efficiency** amid increased **capital expenditure (+8.5%)** and investments in **online expansion**.  \n- The decline in profitability is linked to **inflationary pressures**, **higher operating costs**, and **extraordinary expenses** including **litigation and restructuring charges**, as well as accounting impacts from **property buybacks under IFRS 16**.  \n- The **equity base** expanded due to increased **pension surplus** and acquisitions, diluting ROE despite operational profitability gains.  \n- Financial risk reduced with a lower **gearing ratio** (2.41 to 1.93) and improved **liquidity ratios** (current ratio 0.65 to 0.73, quick ratio 0.24 to 0.29), supporting a stronger balance sheet.  \n- **Legal and tax risks** decreased significantly, enhancing the company\u2019s overall **risk profile** and reducing potential liabilities.  \n- Reporting quality improved, shown by increased **risk disclosure specificity** and stable, clear narrative complexity, aiding investor transparency.  \n- Short-term ROE improvement is expected to be limited due to ongoing **cost inflation**, **capital investments**, and **restructuring expenses**, but **strategic cost savings (~\u00a31bn over 3 years)** and focus on operational efficiency aim to reverse margin and asset turnover declines.  \n- The company\u2019s commitment to **share buybacks** and a **progressive dividend policy** underscores a focus on **shareholder returns** that may support medium-term ROE recovery.  \n- Overall, while operational fundamentals are solid and financial risks are managed well, the current elevated equity base and margin pressures weigh on profitability metrics; gradual improvement is anticipated with sustained execution."

The Group has defined and outlined the purpose of its APMs in the Glossary starting on page 207. During the year, the operating profit and EPS APMs were renamed. 'Operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' has changed to 'Adjusted operating profit'. 'Diluted EPS before exceptional and other items' has changed to 'Adjusted diluted EPS'. The Retail free cash flow APM was amended in order to provide a more consistent and predictable view of free cash flow generated by the Group's retail operation. 'Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' within operating profit, along with net pension finance costs, fair value remeasurements of financial instruments, and the tax impact of such items below operating profit, are now called 'Adjusting items'. The policy for determining adjusting items, and the items adjusted for, are unchanged from the prior year and hence there is no impact on previously reported APMs. a Adjusted operating profit and Adjusted diluted EPS exclude the impact of adjusting items. b The share base used in Adjusted diluted EPS in the prior year is adjusted to capture the full impact of the share consolidation which followed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, as if it took place at the start of the 2020 21 financial year. As such, Adjusted diluted EPS adjusted for share consolidation is presented on a basis other than in accordance with IAS 33. c The Group has changed its accounting policy for property buybacks in light of an evolution of accepted practice in relation to the application of IFRS 16 'Leases' to such transactions. Comparatives have been restated for this change in accounting policy see Note 1 on page 122 for further details. d Net debt and Retail free cash flow exclude the impact of Tesco Bank. e Statutory diluted EPS from continuing operations.

Not only have we managed the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have also been looking forward, setting out our new multi-year performance framework and the strategic priorities that will support us to deliver against it. I would like to thank every Tesco colleague in every market and every business, for their hard work and for never losing sight of our purpose and values. Living our new purpose Having a strong purpose is essential to the running of our business: it is what drives us forward and guides the decisions we make. Reflecting our commitment to the communities we serve and the wider environment, it is right that we have evolved our purpose: serving our customers, communities and planet a little better every day. A recent example of this is in response to the war in Ukraine. It is deeply sad to see the impact on the people of Ukraine and our thoughts are with everyone affected. As a business, we responded quickly, leveraging our partnership with the British Red Cross to provide help where it was needed. Thanks to the generosity of our customers and colleagues, together we have raised almost PS4m to help the Red Cross get vital support to those affected. While Tesco has no direct operations in either Russia or Ukraine, we are keeping a close eye on the evolving situation and its effect on the wider global economy. Everyone plays an important role in delivering on this purpose. It guides the discussions we have as a Board and we have played an active role in supporting the work of the Executive team when it comes to key issues such as health and the environment. This year, we are introducing new remuneration performance targets specifically related to our progress on key sustainability measures. This means that 25% of the Performance Share Plan awards will depend on our progress on gender and ethnicity representation, carbon reduction and food waste reduction in our own operations, subject to approval at the AGM see more on pages 80 to 82. The Board continues to engage with stakeholders both inside and outside the business see more on pages 20 to 22. As a business, we have a deep understanding of our customers, and the expertise in our team to help drive progress. For example, our team of chefs and product developers have been working to improve the health profile of our products without affecting taste, as we work to increase the number of healthy products, as a proportion of sales, to 65% by 2025. A new chapter In October 2021, we set out the new strategic priorities and performance framework for the business see pages 14 and 15. In this next chapter, Tesco will focus on driving greater value for all stakeholders - doing the basics brilliantly and leveraging our many unique advantages across the Tesco Group to enhance competitiveness, accelerate growth and generate cash. We will also deliver ongoing capital returns to shareholders, through our progressive dividend policy and share buyback programme. We have set a full-year dividend of 10.90p and a commitment to repurchase shares worth PS750m over the next 12 months. Strong growth By remaining customer-focused at all times, Tesco has delivered a strong full-year performance, with Group sales increasing 2.5% at actual rates and adjusted operating profit reaching PS2.8bn. The work we have done in the UK last year means we are winning customers from our competitors, with overall customer perception of the brand stepping forward once again across value and quality. Our Brand index stepped forward by 9bps in the year, on top of exceptional growth last year. This year has demonstrated the resilience of our supply chains and strong partnerships we have built with suppliers. Many businesses experienced disruption in their supply chains including from COVID-19, labour shortages and post-Brexit restrictions. These have all impacted the way we work, but thanks to extensive planning and an agile response, we were able to protect availability for customers. Board changes In January, we announced that Steve Golsby and Simon Patterson will retire from the Board at this year's AGM. Both Steve and Simon have made valuable contributions to the Tesco team over many years and I wish them all the best in the future. Steve Golsby will also step down from his role as Chair of the Remuneration Committee and will be succeeded by Alison Platt. Looking ahead On behalf of myself and the Board, I would like to thank colleagues across the Group for their continued commitment and hard work over the past 12 months. We have overcome many obstacles together, and I am sure there will be more to come, but the new purpose and strategic priorities will steer us on the path of building a stronger and more sustainable business that we can continue to be proud of. John Allan CBE Non-executive Chairman 12 April 2022 Creating long-term sustainable value. Strategic report 9 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 The momentum in our business is strong and with a refreshed purpose and new strategic priorities, there is energy and drive to keep growing and innovating. Group Chief Executive's review This year, we have turned the pages on a new chapter. Our new purpose and strategic priorities will set us up to be even more competitive in the future, building on the fantastic work done to date. I want to thank the Tesco team for their hard work and for the way colleagues have supported each other through the challenges of the last year. The culture within Tesco is one of our unique strengths, guided by our values that no one tries harder for customers, we treat people how they want to be treated and every little help makes a big difference. Driven by our strengths As we developed the plans that will enable our next chapter, we wanted to truly understand what our strengths are, how the market is moving and what we need to do to better serve customers in the future. The result is a new set of strategic priorities for the Group and a performance framework to help track our progress over the coming years. We have the right plans in place, and our colleagues have embraced them wholeheartedly. Our new purpose Tesco is more than a supermarket to its customers, and colleagues agreed that we needed to broaden our purpose for a world where our customers still expect us to serve them as shoppers, but also as contributors to their community and to the wider world. We have therefore updated our purpose to be 'Serving our customers, communities and planet a little better every day'. The word 'customer' better encompasses how we serve people across the Tesco Group - from Tesco shoppers and Bank customers to Booker retail partners and dunnhumby's global clients. By acknowledging our communities and the planet within our purpose, we ensure they are factored into every decision we make. With the COP26 Climate Conference hosted in Glasgow in 2021, we set out our own Climate Manifesto Tesco PLC: A Better Basket. Tesco's journey on climate action started many years ago, but this year we have worked to be even more ambitious and accelerate our progress. Our UK target to be carbon neutral in our own operations by 2035 was this year extended to cover the whole Group and we committed to achieving net zero emissions across our entire value chain by 2050, including those generated by the products we sell and across our supply chains. Meeting these targets will be challenging. It will need transformational change as well as close collaboration with our suppliers and customers, but it is essential if we are to tackle the climate crisis see more on page 40. In February 2022, we were all deeply distressed to see the crisis unfold in Ukraine. Our hearts go out to everyone affected. We have been working alongside the British Red Cross to offer help in the most practical ways we can. Together with customers, we have raised almost PS4m to the British Red Cross, as well as PS500,000 to humanitarian organisations in Central Europe. We are also leveraging our distribution network in Central Europe to get supplies where they are most needed: supporting Ukrainian refugees to access Tesco jobs in all our markets: and removing fees from Tesco Bank transfers to Ukraine or Tesco mobile calls to Ukraine. We will continue to respond to the evolving situation. Our strategic priorities The new strategic priorities and performance framework for the Group are set out in more detail on pages 14 and 15. Magnetic value for customers Magnetic value is the combination of price, quality, range, customer experience - and it is also the work we do to bring value to communities and the planet more broadly, through our work on health and sustainability. This strategic priority is all about providing reliable value that removes customers' needs to shop elsewhere, combined with positive reasons to shop more with us. I love my Tesco Clubcard More than 20 million households have a Clubcard, and going forward, we will be making even greater use of insight to make the shopping experience more personalised and relevant. Combining Clubcard with our online grocery business, our nine million regular app users and the capability offered by dunnhumby, we have the opportunity to create additional value and increase loyalty. Easily the most convenient To be convenient now means serving customers wherever, whenever and however they want to be served. We believe we can do that better than anyone by leveraging our existing reach and strong network. We will continue to adapt, while at the same time seeking capital-light growth opportunities in the two key growth channels of online and convenience. Save to invest To give us the fuel to invest in our priorities and to offset inflationary pressures, we need to continue our longstanding approach of being as simple, agile and productive as we can be. We want to make sure we only spend money where it adds value for customers and, in total, we are aiming for around PS1bn of savings across a range of areas over the next three years. 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 Taken together, these priorities will ensure we do the basics brilliantly, operate as efficiently as possible, embed sustainability in every decision we make and grow our business by building on our unique strengths. Our colleagues will be pivotal in delivering our strategic priorities, and bringing them to life in a way that makes a difference for our customers and stakeholders. Performance framework To track our progress, we set out measures in a multi-year performance framework. We are seeking to grow the top line, underpinned by increasing customer satisfaction and adding capital-light opportunities in convenience and online. We are aiming to grow, or at least maintain, market share in our core UK market. We are also seeking to grow absolute profits in quantum terms. We will target productivity savings to at least offset inflation in the medium term and ideally create headroom to invest in our other strategic priorities. By doing this, we are clear that we can generate between PS1.4bn and PS1.8bn of Retail free cash flow each year. Significant progress As we developed and set out our strategic priorities, we did not take our foot off the pedal for our customers. After a challenging few years, we know that rising inflation is really at the front of customers' minds. Our commitment to value is unwavering, and now more than ever, it is essential that customers can rely on Tesco for value. Through our powerful combination of Aldi Price Match, Low Everyday Prices and Clubcard Prices, we are making more products more affordable, in more places than anyone else on the market. Clubcard remains a key driver of loyalty, used by more than 20 million UK households. 100% of UK promotions are through Clubcard Prices and we are bringing the benefits of the Tesco family to Clubcard holders, with Tesco Bank recently launching Clubcard Pay, a new way to pay, save and pick up extra Clubcard points. As we aim to be even more convenient for our customers, we have grown our online businesses in every region and introduced rapid delivery in the UK through Tesco Whoosh, now available in over 200 stores. We have also demonstrated innovation in the way we improve the quality and sustainability of our products. We have increased the number of vegetables in our ready meals, introduced sustainable packaging solutions including refillable cleaning products and, in partnership with WWF, launched the Tesco Innovation Fund, enabling start-ups to get vital seed funding for ideas that make food production more sustainable. I would like to thank our suppliers for embracing innovation with us and working towards an even stronger partnership. We are pleased that suppliers have voted Tesco top of the independent Advantage survey for six years running. From a team perspective, I am delighted that Guus Dekkers, our Chief Technology Officer, has been appointed to the Executive Committee. As technology plays a more central role in our business, his appointment reiterates the growing importance we assign to technology and digitalisation going forward. I am also delighted to welcome Emma Taylor to the Executive Committee as Chief People Officer. Emma has been promoted from her role as People Director UK & ROI and will take over from Natasha Adams as Chief People Officer. Natasha will stay on the Executive Committee, and relocate to Ireland in her new role as CEO of Tesco Ireland. Well positioned to deliver for our stakeholders For shareholders, our strong performance to date and our confidence in our ability to generate cash in the coming years, have enabled us to announce the start of a share buyback programme that will balance the maintenance of a strong capital structure with returning surplus cash. Recognised for our efforts on sustainability Our sustainability efforts are grounded in doing the right thing for our customers, communities and the planet and we were pleased to be recognised with numerous awards this year. Highlights included qualifying for the Top 100 Stonewall Equality Index, being named the MSC Supermarket of the Year 2021 and achieving leading retailer status within the World Benchmarking Alliance Food and Agriculture Benchmark. In November 2021, we were proud to be awarded the Terra Carta seal in recognition of our leadership role in transitioning towards a net zero future. com sustainability We are also committed to our progressive dividend policy and are pleased to pay a full-year dividend of 10.90p. The work we have done this year and the progress we have made with our customers gives me confidence that we are on the right path to achieve sustainable growth in the future. Together, we will build on our success over the past year, sustain our position, deliver against our strategic priorities and in doing so, accelerate our momentum. Above all, we will make the most of our unique strengths and the fantastic team of colleagues helping us to serve our customers, communities and planet a little better every day. Ken Murphy Group Chief Executive 12 April 2022 Strategic report 11 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 What is your highlight this year? We hosted an event for colleagues in September to talk about the new strategic priorities and purpose. During the Q&A session, the questions really struck me. Colleagues asked 'How can I get involved personally and make more of a contribution to my community and the planet?' or 'I have so many ideas - how can I share them?' I have been humbled by the positive engagement from colleagues and knowing they feel connected with the new purpose and strategy. How are you embedding the new purpose across the business? It is a core part of delivering our strategy and it needs to happen at every level - from shop floor to boardroom. The Group Leadership Team was heavily involved in the journey as we set out our strategy and after we launched our purpose, myself, Jason Tarry and other Exec members travelled around the UK and Ireland to host townhall sessions with colleagues, to hear their feedback and respond to questions. Why was it important to call out Communities and Planet in the purpose? For a long time, Tesco has been an active member in local communities and our work to reduce our environmental impact started many years ago. We recognise that the future of our business depends not only on the actions we take, but also on the world around us. With the urgent need to tackle the climate crisis and address big social issues like food poverty and inclusion, it was right to reflect these commitments in our everyday decision making. Why is there no Little Helps Plan report this year? We want to seize the opportunity of the new purpose and strategy to reset our sustainability reporting and reflect the deeper integration of sustainability across our business and the needs of our stakeholders. So, from now on, we will report progress on our material sustainability issues within our Annual Report and provide comprehensive updates across the full breadth of sustainability issues on our dedicated online reporting hub. To find out more, please visit www. What are Tesco's sustainability priorities and why? We always listen to our customers, colleagues and wider stakeholders to understand which sustainability issues matter most and where Tesco can make the greatest difference and drive transformative change. In adopting the principles of double materiality, we have identified four broad issue areas we want to lead on: climate change: healthy, sustainable diets: packaging & waste: and diversity & inclusion. Is Tesco doing enough to combat climate change? As part of our commitment to be carbon neutral in our own Group operations by 2035 and across our entire value chain by 2050, we are working to drive improvements at every point in our food system - in our own operations, in our supply chain, and in our customers' homes. We know there is more to do and we are building decarbonisation pathways, identifying the actions required to achieve our net zero ambition. What progress have you made towards your health targets? We are constantly reformulating our products to improve the health profile and in the last year we have taken out a further 7.7 billion calories. Our new ranges make it easier for customers to eat more fruit and veg, such as our Meat & Veg range, but there's plenty more to do across our markets as we work towards our target to increase sales of healthy products. This year, performance has not progressed, as a result of some product consolidation to keep supply moving as well as the transfer of less healthy choices from hospitality to retailers. What are the key priorities for the year ahead? I'm excited about the momentum we are building. We have a formula that is working and that we can build on and accelerate. For me, it's about really making progress against those key strategic priorities. There's plenty of exciting innovation in the pipeline - in product development, channels and customer experience. For example, we are aiming to extend our Whoosh rapid delivery service to 600 Express stores by the end of the year. Group Chief Executive's review continued How are you delivering value for shareholders? From our performance this year, we're gaining share against all the key competitors. Customers are recognising the tangible improvements we're making in our offer, which is driving outperformance against the market. I believe that Tesco is an outstanding business and one that can create significant value for shareholders. How we use cash is incredibly important, and we have taken great care to test every element of our capital allocation framework - refreshing our leverage target, the application of our dividend policy and launching our first share buyback. We have returned PS300m of capital through our share buyback programme to date, and commit to a further PS750m by April 2023. How are you recognising the extraordinary efforts of colleagues this year? Colleagues truly are at the heart of our business and their skills and capabilities have enabled us to deliver for our customers through the challenges of recent times. We recently reached an agreement with USDAW for a substantial increase in UK base pay - by 5.8% to PS10.10 for hourly-paid store and customer fulfilment centre CFC colleagues. We have also announced a one-off thank you payment of 1.25% of annual earnings to hourly-paid store, CFC and customer engagement centre colleagues in the UK. This payment recognises the contribution of our colleagues and is part of a wider investment in making Tesco a great place to work, which includes supporting their physical and mental wellbeing, both in and out of work and building an inclusive culture where everyone feels welcome. What is your outlook for the year ahead? As we build on our momentum over the coming year we believe that it is important to remain focused on championing great value. We expect to see a normalisation in customer behaviour as we come out of the pandemic, but the exact scale and timing of this is difficult to assess. We're also expecting continued cost inflation through the year. Overall, we expect to deliver retail adjusted operating profit of between PS2.4bn and PS2.6bn for FY 2022 23. 12 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 Group sales d increased by 3.0% at constant rates, with growth across all regions on top of exceptionally strong sales last year. Revenue increased by 6.4% at constant rates including fuel sales growth of 48.1% as customers travelled more following the easing of government restrictions. While two-year like-for-like h fuel sales growth was negative at 6.4 %, this primarily reflects lower demand in the first half, with fuel sales ahead of pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. Group adjusted operating profit e grew by 58.9% at constant rates, reflecting the strong sales performance across the retail businesses, a reduction in COVID-19 related costs and a return to profitability in Tesco Bank. These benefits were partially offset by inflationary pressures in the cost base, particularly in distribution costs. Group statutory operating profit, which includes adjusting items related to the costs of historical shareholder litigation claims, grew by 65.5%. Finance income and finance costs reduced year-on-year primarily due to fair value remeasurement gains related to the mark-tomarket movement on inflation-linked swaps, which were a PS123m benefit this year compared to a PS 214 m charge in the prior year. The reduction in our share of profit from joint ventures and associates was principally due to profit from Tesco Underwriting Group review of performance. Financial review being recognised within Tesco Bank operating profit following its full acquisition in May. The increase in tax this year primarily reflects higher levels of both retail and Tesco Bank operating profit, in addition to the revaluation of deferred tax relating to the announced change in the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective 1 April 2023. Our adjusted diluted EPS e, g rose by 88.8%, reflecting the increase in retail and Tesco Bank operating profit and a reduction in net finance costs. We have proposed a final dividend of 7.70 pence per ordinary share, taking the full-year dividend to 10.90 pence per ordinary share, an increase of 19.1% year-on-year. Net debt b, f reduced by PS1.4bn year-on-year, primarily driven by strong free cash flow generation. Retail free cash flow f increased by PS0.9bn year-on-year due to higher retail operating profits, the elimination of UK pension contributions following the PS2.5bn one-off contribution last year from the Asia disposal proceeds and a working capital benefit from higher sales. These benefits were partly offset by an increase in capital expenditure. The Net debt EBITDA ratio was 2.5 times at the year end, compared to 3.3 times last year.

During the year, the operating profit and EPS APMs were renamed. Profit has changed from 'Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' to 'Adjusted operating profit'. EPS has changed from 'Diluted EPS before exceptional and other items' to 'Adjusted diluted EPS'. The Retail free cash flow APM was amended in order to provide a more consistent and predictable view of free cash flow generated by the Group's retail operation. 'Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' within operating profit, along with net pension finance costs, fair value remeasurements of financial instruments, and the tax impact of such items below operating profit, are now called 'Adjusting items'. The policy for determining adjusting items, and the items adjusted for, are unchanged from the prior year and hence there is no impact on previously reported APMs. b All measures apart from Net debt are shown on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated. Further details on discontinued operations can be found in Note 7, starting on page 140. c The Group has changed its accounting policy for property buybacks in light of an evolution of accepted practice in relation to the application of IFRS 16 'Leases' to such transactions. Comparatives have been restated for this change in accounting policy see Note 1 on page 122 for further details. d Group sales exclude VAT and fuel. Sales change shown on a comparable days basis for Central Europe. e Adjusted operating profit and Adjusted diluted EPS exclude Adjusting items as noted in footnote a. f Net debt and Retail free cash flow exclude Tesco Bank. g The share base used in Adjusted diluted EPS in the prior year is adjusted to capture the full impact of the share consolidation which followed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, as if it took place at the start of the 2020 21 financial year. As such, Adjusted diluted EPS adjusted for share consolidation is presented on a basis other than in accordance with IAS 33. Please see page 210 for a reconciliation to Adjusted diluted EPS. Like-for-like is a measure of growth in Group online sales and sales from stores that have been open for at least a year at constant exchange rates, excluding VAT and fuel. h Like-for-like is a measure of growth in Group online sales and sales from stores that have been open for at least a year at constant exchange rates, excluding VAT and fuel. i Capex excludes additions arising from business combinations and buybacks of properties typically stores, as well as additions relating to decommissioning provisions and similar items. 23 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 Strategic report Financial review continued UK & ROI overview In the UK & ROI, one-year like-for-like sales increased by 2.2% on top of exceptional growth last year, driven by a sharp recovery in Booker catering sales, strong non-food sales in the UK & ROI and sustained market outperformance in the UK. Two-year like-for-like sales increased by 8.8% with all businesses growing versus pre-pandemic levels. UK & ROI adjusted operating profit was PS2,481m, up 35.4% at constant rates as higher sales volumes and lower COVID-19 costs year-on-year offset underlying operating cost inflation. In the UK, we continued to incur COVID-19 related costs, primarily relating to colleague absence for those colleagues who were sick or self-isolating and additional costs related to sustained elevated online sales. Total COVID-19 related costs were PS 220 m, significantly less than the PS 892 m incurred last year. Our assumption for the current year is that we will incur a significantly lower level of COVID-19 costs as colleague absence rates return to pre-pandemic levels. Around PS 80 m of residual costs will remain, relating to increased online demand, however we do not plan to report these separately going forwards. Adjusted operating margin was up 94 basis points versus last year. Our core UK business benefited from strong growth in higher margin clothing sales, including an increase in full price sales from 77% last year to 86% this year, and Booker profitability recovered as catering demand increased following the reopening of the hospitality sector. Lower COVID-19 related costs were partly offset by our investments in value and service. We were able to more than offset inflationary pressures in the cost base this year with cost savings related to further simplifying our operating model. UK - strong market outperformance, with sales growth on a one-year and two-year basis One-year like-for-like sales grew by 0.4%, including growth of 1.2% in the first half before sales declined by 0.5 % in the second half as we traded over elevated demand during the second and third national lockdowns in the prior year. First half growth was driven by non-food and increased levels of discretionary spend compared to last year, when footfall in stores was lower and customers prioritised spending on food during the first national lockdown. In the second half, food sales declined as customers were able to return to eating more out of home, and reflected very strong comparators last year, including double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. We sought to mitigate as much price inflation as possible, ending the year with our strongest relative price position in over six years. Our ongoing value investments and a higher promotional participation meant we saw sales deflation for the year as a whole, but with inflation increasing during the second half of the year, as the grocery market faced significant cost pressures. Two-year like-for-like sales grew by 8.2%, with growth both in stores and online, and in food and non-food. Average basket sizes across the business remained higher than pre-pandemic levels, partially offset by fewer shopping trips. Our relentless focus on providing customers with great value and service resulted in consistent outperformance against the market throughout the year. Our UK market share reached its highest level in over four years and we saw 23 consecutive periods of net switching gains. We gained market share in the year on both a value and volume basis, with volume growing ahead of value as we did everything we could to minimise inflation for our customers. We have market leading two-year improvements in brand index 413bps, value 483bps and quality 385bps perception. During the year we extended Clubcard Prices to all Express stores, increasing Clubcard sales penetration by 21%pts year-on-year in those stores. Clubcard penetration in large stores was 86%, increasing by 7%pts year-on-year. Online one-year like-for-like sales declined by 6.5 % as some customers chose to return to shopping in our stores as the pandemic eased. Online sales participation was 14% across the full year, with a peak during the first quarter of 15.5%. Two-year like-for-like sales grew by 66.1% and sales participation in online was 5% higher than before the pandemic, driven by both a sustained increase in orders and higher basket sizes. We have added PS2.3bn of online sales and fulfilled an average of over 1.2 million customer orders per week versus 0.7 million pre-pandemic. Segmental review of performance Sales performance: exc.

The fifth UFC is expected to open next month, in Rutherglen. Following encouraging initial trials, we expanded 'Tesco Whoosh' - our 60-minute delivery service - from 50 stores in the first half to over 200 stores by the end of the year. We offer customers more than 1,700 products, including fresh food, and delivery slots are available between 7am and 10pm, every day. We plan to roll the service out to 600 stores over the coming year. In October, we launched a pilot with Gorillas in our Thornton Heath store in London, offering customers grocery deliveries within ten minutes on a range of 2,000 products. Convenience one-year like-for-like sales declined by 0.8 %, with a decline in the first half partially offset by growth of 4.0% in the second half as footfall in city centres recovered. Growth was particularly strong in our 'on the go' stores and in 'food to go' and 'food for tonight' ranges, where sales grew by 34.9% and 21.6% respectively. Sales in our stores in neighbourhood locations declined following very high levels of demand last year as customers shopped closer to home. Non-food sales growth was particularly strong this year, driven mainly by Clothing 19.4% as customers spent more time shopping our ranges in-store and we responded to changing customer demand in our ranges. Growth was particularly strong in Womenswear and Kids, and benefited from a rebalancing of space between Clothing and General Merchandise, now completed in 116 of our large stores, making Clothing more of a destination shop and making our food-adjacent General Merchandise ranges simpler and easier to shop. Food sales were marginally behind last year, down 0.4 %, driven mainly by lower demand in those categories which benefited from elevated levels of in-home consumption last year, including meat, fish & poultry, and grocery. Demand for plant-based products continues to grow at pace, with sales of plant-based meat alternatives growing by 130% since our 2018 base line. We expanded our plant-based ranges further in the year, launching an additional 173 products, including our Wicked Kitchen meal deal in January on a two-year basis. Total 'UK like-for-like' sales grew across all categories, with a particularly strong contribution from food. We rolled out soft plastic recycling facilities across all of our large UK stores and launched an innovative Reuse proposition in 10 stores as we continue to tackle plastic waste. We removed an additional 600 million pieces of plastic from our packaging this year, taking the cumulative total pieces of plastic removed over the past two years to 1.6 billion. We removed a further 7.7 billion calories from our own brand ranges as part of our work towards achieving 65% of our sales from healthy products by 2025. Our 'Buy One to Help a Child' campaign - where we gave a donation for every piece of fruit and vegetables purchased across our stores and online - provided FareShare with 3 million meals-worth of food to help charities and community groups. In September, we announced accelerated climate ambitions, bringing forward our Group own operations net zero target to 2035. We also launched a new goal to be net zero across our entire value chain by 2050, aligned to a 1.5degC pathway. We continued to roll out electric online delivery vans, set up new renewable energy projects and launched our first two electric HGVs in our distribution operations this year. We also launched our  supply-chain financing programme and issued our second  bond. In November, we were delighted to be awarded the Prince of Wales's Terra Carta Seal in recognition of our commitment to and momentum towards a climate and nature-positive future. ROI - one-year LFL 2.9 % reflecting higher demand last year: 10.6% growth on a two-year basis One-year like-for-like sales declined by 2.9 % as we traded over exceptional COVID-19 demand last year. The COVID-19 impact was particularly strong in ROI as the restrictions on hospitality were in place for a longer period than in the UK. Despite the exceptionally strong comparative, ROI like-for-like sales grew by 0.3% over Christmas and we gained market share in the fourth quarter. Two-year like-for-like sales grew by 10.6%, reflecting a significant benefit from retained levels of higher in-home consumption. Our online business grew by 3.1% on a one-year basis and now represents 8% of our sales. We have maintained a leading position, with a market share of 59%. We expanded our online offering further this year, rolling out an additional 37 Click & Collect locations and increasing our total slot capacity by 69%. We launched Aldi Price Match in ROI in January, with hundreds of products matched. We have started to roll out Clubcard Prices, following successful Clubcard Prices Events. We also focused on making shopping easier for customers, including rolling out 'Scan As You Shop' to all large stores. We announced an intention to acquire 10 Joyce's Supermarkets in Galway in November. The acquisition is subject to the approval of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. BOOKER - strong sales growth on both a one-year and two-year basis LFL sales change Sales One-year Two-year Retail PS4,651m 0.7% 19.3% Retail exc.

Booker delivered double-digit like-for-like sales growth on both a one-year and two-year basis. One-year growth of 15.3% was driven by a sharp recovery in catering sales as hospitality outlets reopened, with a strong contribution from Best Food Logistics, the majority of whose customers are fast-service restaurants. Two-year catering sales declined by 1.6 % in total, impacted by the phased reopening of the hospitality sector in the first half. In the second half catering sales were ahead of pre-pandemic levels, with growth of 9.6% supported by strong execution and competitive pricing. Strategic report 25 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 In the retail business, one-year like-for-like sales grew 0.7%, primarily due to inflation in tobacco driven by annual duty increases. Retail sales excluding tobacco were marginally lower than last year as we lapped a strong uplift in neighbourhood-based convenience stores as customers shopped closer to home. Despite supply chain challenges, we delivered a resilient performance and gained new customers. Two-year retail like-for-like sales grew 19.3% driven by strong customer retention. CENTRAL EUROPE - growth across all channels and categories on a one-year and two-year like-for-like basis Like-for-like sales grew by 2.9% on a one-year basis and by 2.5% on a two-year basis, with growth across all channels and categories. Growth was particularly strong in Slovakia and Hungary, and in our compact hypermarket and supermarket formats as customer footfall improved and we were able to offer our full range following non-food selling restrictions last year. Trading conditions were more challenging in the Czech Republic, due to non-food sales restrictions in the first quarter. Non-food sales grew by 13.3%, with strong growth in both Clothing and General Merchandise. We saw a particularly positive customer response to our seasonal events. Customer net promoter score improved significantly across all markets year-on-year, driven by improvements in the shopping trip, with scores almost doubling by the end of the year for the region as a whole. We continued to strengthen our value proposition in the region, including the launch of Clubcard Prices Events in Slovakia and Hungary. Clubcard penetration increased during these events as customers accessed market-leading prices. Following the success of these initial events, we will expand Clubcard Prices to all markets and categories in the current year. Central Europe adjusted operating profit was PS168m, an increase of 41.1% at constant rates. Adjusted operating profit growth was driven by strong sales, lower COVID-19 related costs and higher margins from more full-priced non-food sales. We have agreed the sale of 17 malls and one retail park in Central Europe. The transaction is expected to complete in the first half of the current year, generating proceeds of c. PS200m and resulting in a c. PS 12 m impact to adjusted operating profit in the current year, driven by a reduction in mall income. We will continue to operate the Tesco hypermarkets in the malls on a long-term leasehold basis. TESCO BANK - year-on-year profit increase reflecting prior year COVID-19 impact on potential bad debts This year Last year YoY Revenue PS922m PS735m 25.4% Adjusted operating profit loss PS176m PS 175 m n m Lending to customers PS6.5bn PS6.4bn 1.6% Customer deposits PS 5.3 bn PS 5.7 bn 7.0% Net interest margin a 5.0% 4.7% 0.3%pts Total capital ratio b 27.2% 28.5% 2.4 %pts a The prior period net interest margin has been restated from 5.2% to 4.7%. b The prior period total capital ratio has been restated from 28.4% to 28.5%. Revenue grew by 25.4%, due to the benefit of the full acquisition of Tesco Underwriting which completed in May 2021. Revenue excluding Tesco Underwriting declined by 9.4 %, primarily as a result of lower income from unsecured lending due to lower average balances as customers paid down their debt during the pandemic, or increased savings buffers which reduced the need for new credit. We did however see a strong recovery in credit card customers' spending levels and in new business unsecured lending volumes. ATM transactions increased by 13.6% year-on-year as cash usage recovered post-lockdown. Travel money continued to be impacted by the pandemic and international travel restrictions, although we saw an encouraging increase in demand at the end of the year as restrictions eased. Tesco Bank adjusted operating profit was PS176m, including a PS13m contribution from Tesco Underwriting being fully consolidated. The significant recovery reflects the charge last year related to an increase in the provision for potential bad debts which accounted for the anticipated macroeconomic impact from COVID-19. We released part of this provision in the second half as the macroeconomic outlook improved and customer defaults remained low. We then recognised a separate provision in the second half to reflect the increased risk associated with cost of living pressures. The Bank's balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have sufficient capital and liquidity to absorb changes in both regulatory and funding requirements. In recognition of the sharp recovery in profitability in the year, the Bank paid a dividend of PS87m to the Group. This comprises the typical annual PS50m dividend for the 2021 22 financial year and a catch-up of PS37m in relation to the reduced payment of PS13m in the prior year. Tesco Bank won 'Best Overall Provider' at the 2021 YourMoney Awards, in recognition of the quality of our customer service and competitive pricing of our products. We introduced a number of new products and services for customers this year including Clubcard Pay in January. We also expanded our offer with the relaunch of travel insurance. Since August, all new and renewing Tesco Bank car and home insurance policies are being underwritten by Tesco Underwriting following the completion of its acquisition in May. Adjusting items in statutory operating profit This year Last year Litigation costs PS 193 m PS 93 m Property transactions PS128m PS26m Net impairment reversal of non-current assets PS 115 m PS128m Amortisation of acquired intangible assets PS 76 m PS 76 m Restructuring provisions PS 44 m - Asia licence fee income PS26m - Disposal of China associate Fair value less cost of disposal movements on assets held for sale PS15m PS 6 m - - Impairment charge on Tesco Bank goodwill - PS 295 m UK - ATM business rates - PS105m Booker integration costs - PS 25 m GMP equalisation - PS 7 m Employee share scheme - PS 4 m Total adjusting items in statutory operating profit PS 265 m PS 241 m Adjusting items are excluded from our adjusted operating profit performance by virtue of their size and nature to provide a helpful alternative perspective of the year-on-year performance of the Group's ongoing trading business. Total adjusting items in statutory operating profit in the year resulted in a charge of PS 265 m, compared to a charge of PS 241 m in the prior year. In September 2020, two claimant law firms issued proceedings against us in relation to the overstatement of expected profit announced in 2014. These claims have now been settled and we have recognised an adjusting charge of PS 193 m. The settlement of these claims was paid in full in the year, PS 105 m in the first half and PS 88 m in the second half. This cash outflow is presented within adjusting cash items. Given that the legal timeframe for bringing a claim has now elapsed, no further related claims can be brought by shareholders. Financial review continued 26 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 A non-cash fair value remeasurement credit of PS123m primarily related to the mark-to-market movement on inflation-linked swaps, driven by the impact of an increase in expected future inflation rates. These swaps eliminate the impact of future inflation on the Group's cash flow in relation to historical sale and leaseback property transactions. Net pension finance costs of PS 22 m decreased by PS21m, primarily driven by a reduction in the pension deficit following the PS2.5bn one-off contribution made in the prior year from the proceeds from the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia. We expect net pension finance income of PS79m in the current year as a result of the closing IAS 19 pension surplus. In February, we exercised the option to buy back our partner's equity in the Tesco Dorney Limited Partnership property joint venture. We expect the transaction to complete towards the end of our 2022 23 financial year, bringing seven large stores back into full ownership. This will result in annual cash rental savings of c. PS30m and a c. PS 0.3 bn increase in net debt, comprising a c. PS 0.7 bn impact on borrowings, partially offset by a c. PS0.4bn reduction in lease liabilities. Following this transaction, we will have five UK property JV structures still in place, from a peak of 13 structures in 2015. These five remaining structures contain property worth PS3.2bn and debt of PS2.1bn, with PS1.9bn of associated lease liabilities on our balance sheet. The three largest of our remaining property JVs are with the Tesco Pension fund. Further detail on finance income and costs can be found in Note 5 on page 137, as well as further detail on the adjusting items in Note 4 on page 136. Group tax This year Last year Tax on adjusted profit PS 502 m PS 249 m Tax on adjusting items PS 8 m PS145m Tax on profit PS 510 m PS 104 m Tax on adjusted Group profit was PS 502 m, PS 253 m higher than last year, reflecting higher levels of both retail and Tesco Bank operating profit, in addition to a one-off charge related to the revaluation of deferred tax, following the announced increase in the corporation tax rate in the UK from 19% to 25%, effective 1 April 2023. The effective tax rate on adjusted Group profit was 22.8%, higher than the current UK statutory rate of 19%, primarily due to the revaluation of deferred tax. The banking surcharge levied on Tesco Bank profit and depreciation of assets which do not qualify for tax relief also increased the tax rate. We expect an adjusted effective tax rate of between 21% and 22% in the current financial year. We forecast our adjusted effective tax rate to increase to around 26% from our 2023 24 financial year driven by the increase in the UK corporation tax rate in April 2023. Further detail on Group tax can be found in Note 6 on page 138. Total Group cash tax paid in the year was PS 199 m on a continuing operations basis, which included PS 152 m of tax paid in the UK. Tax paid in the year was PS 29 m higher than in the prior year, primarily due to higher levels of retail and Tesco Bank operating profit. This was partly offset by prior-year tax losses and a benefit from the super-deduction allowance on certain capital investments, introduced in the Chancellor's budget in March 2021, along with PS120m in relation to the PS2.5bn one-off pension contribution made in the prior year, the relief for which is required to be spread over four years for tax purposes. We recognised an adjusting credit of PS128m related to the profit generated on disposal of properties in the year. The majority of the property profits recognised related to the sale of our Fenny Lock distribution centre which generated proceeds of PS146m and a PS103m profit on disposal. During the year, the Group recognised a net impairment charge of PS 115 m on non-current assets. This includes PS 62 m required as a result of the Group's acquisition of our partner's stake in The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership joint venture which brought into full ownership 11 stores. The remaining charge largely reflects normal fluctuations in store level performance, property fair values and changes in discount rates, as well as any specific store closures. Amortisation of acquired intangible assets is excluded from our headline performance measures. We incurred a charge of PS 76 m in the period, which primarily relates to our merger with Booker in March 2018, which resulted in the recognition of PS755m of intangible assets. Restructuring provisions of PS 44 m were recognised in the second half, relating to operational restructuring changes announced in February 2022 as part of our 'Save to Invest' programme. We received software licence fee income of PS26m from services provided to CP Group following the sale of our businesses in Asia. Further detail on adjusting items can be found in Note 4, starting on page 136. Joint ventures and associates Our share of post-tax profits from joint ventures and associates was PS15m, compared to PS26m in the prior year. The year-on-year reduction was primarily due to profits from Tesco Underwriting Limited now being recognised in Tesco Bank adjusted operating profit following its full acquisition in May 2021 and a reduction in profits generated by our Trent Hypermarket Limited joint venture in India due to the adverse trading impacts of COVID-19 in the year. Net finance costs This year Last year Net interest on medium term notes, loans and bonds PS 208 m PS 218 m Other interest receivable and similar income PS9m PS15m Other finance charges and interest payable PS 39 m PS 31 m Finance charges payable on lease liabilities PS 405 m PS 446 m Net finance costs before net pension finance costs and fair value remeasurements of financial instruments PS 643 m PS 680 m Fair value remeasurements of financial instruments PS123m PS 214 m Net pension finance costs PS 22 m PS 43 m Net finance costs PS 542 m PS 937 m Net interest on medium term notes, loans and bonds was PS 208 m, down PS10m year-on-year. The reduction in finance costs from bond maturities, tenders and new debt issuances at lower rates of interest was largely offset by interest payable on the PS 453 m of net debt we acquired with The Tesco Property No. 2 Partnership in September 2020 and with the PS 585 m of debt acquired with The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership in December 2021. The acquisition of The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership brings into full ownership 11 stores and resulted in a reduction in the lease liability of PS355m. The derecognition of lease liabilities related to these property buybacks and the reducing nature of our total lease liability over time is the primary driver of the PS41m reduction in finance charges payable on lease liabilities year-on-year. Strategic report 27 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 Earnings per share This year Last year Adjusted diluted EPS 21.86p 11.58p Statutory diluted earnings per share 19.64p 5.58p Statutory basic earnings per share 19.86p 5.60p The share base used in Adjusted diluted EPS in the prior year is adjusted to capture the full impact of the share consolidation which followed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, as if it took place at the start of the 2020 21 financial year. Please see page 142 for a reconciliation to Adjusted diluted EPS. Adjusted diluted EPS was 21.86p 2021: 11.58p, 88.8% higher year-on-year as the recovery in retail and Tesco Bank profits, the drivers of which are described more fully in the segmental review of performance section above, more than offset the higher tax charge. Statutory diluted earnings per share was 19.64p 2021: 5.58p 252.0% higher year-on-year. In addition to the recovery in adjusted operating profit, we saw a significant reduction in the net finance charge due to an offsetting credit from fair value remeasurement of financial instruments, the drivers of which are described in the net finance costs section. These benefits more than offset a higher charge related to adjusting items and a higher tax charge in year, driven by higher adjusted operating profit. Discontinued operations We completed the sale of our business in Poland to Salling Group A S in March 2021, generating proceeds of PS122m and a loss on disposal of PS 23 m. Following the sale of Homeplus for PS4.2bn in 2015, we received legal claims from the purchasers. Although the majority of the claims were dismissed, some findings of liability were made. On 17 September 2021, a Final Award to the purchasers of PS119m in damages, interest and costs was granted. An adjusting charge increasing the provision held by PS33m was recognised in the year. The total cash payment of PS119m was made in the second half. Further information on discontinued operations is included in Note 7, starting on page 140. Dividend Last year we held the full-year dividend in line with the 2019 20 financial year to recognise the strong cash generation of the business, despite the significant operating profit impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. This represented an exception to our dividend policy and resulted in a dividend per share which exceeded 50% of adjusted diluted EPS. We propose to pay a final dividend of 7.70 pence per ordinary share, taking the full-year dividend to 10.90 pence per ordinary share, including the payment of an interim dividend of 3.20 pence per ordinary share in November 2021. This year's final dividend is 19.1% higher than last year, reflecting the increase in retail and Tesco Bank adjusted operating profit and the impact from last year's policy exception. It is our intention to pay a progressive dividend going forward - i. e. we aim to grow the dividend per share each year, broadly targeting a pay-out of around 50% of earnings. The proposed final dividend was approved by the Board of Directors on 12 April 2022 and is subject to the approval of shareholders at this year's Annual General Meeting. The final dividend will be paid on 24 June 2022 to shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on 20 May 2022 the record date. Shareholders may elect to reinvest their dividend in the dividend reinvestment plan DRIP. The last date for receipt of DRIP elections and revocations will be 7 June 2022. Summary of total indebtedness excludes Tesco Bank Feb-22 Feb-21 Movement Net debt before lease liabilities PS 2,570 m PS 3,449 m PS879m Lease liabilities PS 7,946 m PS 8,506 m PS560m Net debt PS 10,516 m PS 11,955 m PS1,439m Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax PS 242 m PS 1,004 m PS762m Total indebtedness PS 10,758 m PS 12,959 m PS2,201m Net debt EBITDA 2.5x 3.3x Total indebtedness ratio 2.5x 3.6x Total indebtedness was PS 10,758 m, down PS2,201m year-on-year primarily driven by strong free cash flow generation leading to a reduction in net debt, net of dividends paid and a PS762m reduction in the IAS 19 pension deficit. Lease liabilities were PS 7,946 m, down PS560m year-on-year largely due to the derecognition of PS355m relating to the 11 stores we took back into full ownership following the purchase of our partner's stake in The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership. We also derecognised PS120m of lease liabilities relating to our Polish business following the sale of the business to Salling Group A S in March 2021. The acquisition of our partner's stake in The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership increased net debt by c. PS 300 m, including PS 585 m of borrowings acquired and PS 64 m of derivatives, net of a reduction in the related lease liabilities. Pension liabilities significantly decreased during the year, primarily due to an increase in discount rates driven by higher corporate bond yields, partially offset by underlying market movements in inflation rates and gilts. The pension assets increased year-on-year due to strong investment returns. As a result, we carried a net IAS 19 pension surplus post-tax at the end of the year of PS2,121m, compared to a net deficit of PS 1,004 m last year. The Group IAS 19 pension surplus is disregarded in total indebtedness and only pension schemes which are in a net deficit position are considered. We had strong levels of liquidity at the end of the year of PS3.0bn and our PS2.5bn committed facility remained undrawn. Our committed facility currently matures in September 2024 and we have the option to extend this by a further year. The rate of interest payable on this facility is linked to three of our sustainability commitments. As we delivered these sustainability targets, we achieved the corresponding margin reduction in the year. In October, we issued our second  bond, raising PS400m at a low rate of interest. This was issued to refinance a bond which was approaching maturity and the refinancing will result in an annual interest saving of PS18m. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.5 times, down from 3.3 times at the prior year end and within our targeted range of 2.8 to 2.3 times. The year-on-year improvement represents both an increase in our retail EBITDA due to higher sales and lower COVID-19 costs, and a reduction in net debt before lease liabilities driven by strong free cash flow generation. The total indebtedness ratio was 2.5 times compared to 3.6 times last year. Fixed charge cover was 3.5 times this year, compared to 2.9 times last year, reflecting a reduction in net finance costs, lease interest payments, lease principal payments and higher retail EBITDA. Financial review continued 28 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 Summary retail cash flow Our retail free cash flow APM definition was updated at the interim results this year to provide a better view of operational cash performance and excludes cashflows related to acquisitions and disposals, property transactions and adjusting cash items. We continue to fully disclose these lines but they do not form part of the retail free cash flow headline APM. The following table reconciles Group adjusted operating profit to retail free cash flow. Further details are included on page 211. This year Last year Adjusted operating profit PS2,825m PS1,788m Less: Tesco Bank adjusted operating profit loss PS 176 m PS175m Retail adjusted operating profit PS2,649m PS1,963m Add back: Depreciation and amortisation PS1,577m PS1,611m Other reconciling items PS61m PS4m Pension deficit contribution PS 19 m PS 351 m Decrease in working capital PS501m PS450m Retail cash generated from operations before adjusting items PS4,769m PS3,677m Cash capex PS 1,050 m PS 902 m Net interest PS 641 m PS 670 m - Interest related to Net debt exc. lease liabilities PS 239 m PS 226 m - Interest related to lease liabilities PS 402 m PS 444 m Tax paid PS 195 m PS 161 m Dividends received PS109m PS23m Repayments of obligations under leases PS 571 m PS 561 m Own shares purchased for share schemes PS 144 m PS 66 m Retail free cash flow PS2,277m PS1,340m Memo: Acquisitions & disposals PS122m PS 2 m Property proceeds & purchases PS228m PS 110 m Cash impact of adjusting items PS 316 m PS 41 m Retail free cash flow increased by PS937m year-on-year to PS2,277m, driven by higher retail adjusted operating profit, a reduction in the pension contribution, a benefit from lower working capital and an increase in the dividend received from Tesco Bank following its return to profitability this year. Following a PS2.5bn one-off contribution towards the pension deficit in the prior year, using the proceeds from the sale of our businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, UK pension contributions were eliminated. We expect an annual benefit of c. PS260m in retail free cash flow as a result of lower pension deficit contributions. The pension cash outflow of PS 19 m in the year mainly relates to Booker pension scheme. Our total working capital inflow was PS501m, driven by the sharp recovery in fuel volumes and Booker's catering business in the first half as travel and hospitality sector restrictions were significantly fewer than at the end of the prior year. In the second half, working capital was broadly neutral, as the seasonal unwind we would normally see following peak trading over the summer was offset by strong UK sales and higher fuel payables due to both higher volumes and cost price inflation. Cash capex increased by PS 148 m year-on-year as we opened more stores in the UK than in the prior year as a result of COVID-19 and continued to expand our online proposition across the UK & ROI businesses. Interest paid related to net debt exc. lease liabilities of PS 239 m was PS 13 m higher year-on-year. The benefit of bond buybacks and refinancing at lower rates of interest was more than offset by the impact of borrowings acquired as part of The Tesco Property No. 2 Limited Partnership from September 2020 and The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership from December 2021. Interest paid related to lease liabilities decreased by PS42m year-on-year primarily due to a reduction in the total lease liability following the derecognition of the liabilities related to these properties. Cash tax paid in the year was PS 195 m, compared to PS 161 m last year. The increase reflects higher retail adjusted operating profits year-on-year, which was partially offset by prior-year tax losses and a benefit from the super-deduction allowance on certain capital investments, which was introduced in the Chancellor's budget in March 2021. We also continue to receive tax relief in relation to the PS2.5bn one-off pension contribution made in the prior year. This amounted to PS120m for the full year. We saw a net cash outflow of PS 144 m related to the purchase of our own shares, which includes PS 191 m of shares purchased in the market to offset the dilution from the issuance of new shares to satisfy the requirements of share schemes and a PS47m cash inflow related to proceeds from colleague share saving schemes. The net impact was PS 78 m higher than the prior year, driven by the phasing of purchases to satisfy current year maturities. This will lead to a significant reduction in the net spend in the current year. Cash flows related to acquisitions and disposals, property transactions and adjusting cash items are now excluded from our simplified definition of retail free cash flow. The inflow from disposals in the year of PS122m includes the proceeds from the sale of our business in Poland to Salling Group A S, which completed in March 2021. We generated a net PS228m from property transactions, which includes PS308m generated from the sale of properties, net of an outflow of PS 80 m related to property buybacks. We disposed of our Fenny Lock distribution centre in the second half for proceeds of PS146m and generated PS109m from the sale of properties in Poland which were not included in the corporate transaction with Salling Group A S. We bought back one Extra store in Bury for PS 37 m and paid cash consideration of PS 43 m to buy back a full stake in The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership. The cash impact of adjusting items was PS 316 m, of which PS 312 m related to the settlement of shareholder litigation claims and a legal claim from the purchasers of our Homeplus business during the period.

Supplementary information page 205 provides a full breakdown of space by segment. Capital expenditure capex shown in the table above reflects expenditure on ongoing business activities across the Group, excluding property buybacks. Our capital expenditure for the year was PS1,101m, PS86m higher year-on-year, which primarily relates to the ongoing investment in our online proposition, and the opening of new Tesco Express and One Stop stores in the UK. We opened a further three UFCs in the UK and rolled out more delivery vans and an additional 37 Click & Collect sites in ROI. We also purchased an additional 20 electric delivery vans and two electric HGVs in the UK as we continue to work to reduce emissions from our own operations. We opened two superstores in the UK, with sites in Mablethorpe and Wolverhampton, and a further 21 Tesco Express sites, which was slightly fewer than expected. We expect to open 65 Tesco Express stores in the current year. We expect 2022 23 full year capital expenditure to be at the top end of our PS0.9bn to PS1.2bn guidance range. Statutory capital expenditure of PS1.8bn includes PS0.6bn relating to the buyback of one UK Extra store in Bury and The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership property joint venture referred to above. Further details of current and forecast space can be found in Supplementary information starting on page 205. Property This year Last year UK & ROI C. Europe Group UK & ROI C.

The estimated market value of our fully owned property as at the year end increased by PS0.2bn to PS18.1bn. The market value of PS18.1bn represents a surplus of PS1.6bn over the net book value. Our Group freehold property ownership percentage, by value was in line with the prior year at 58%. In December, we completed the purchase of our partner's 50% stake in The Tesco Sarum Limited Partnership, bringing back into full ownership seven sites. This acquisition contributed to a 1% increase in the percentage of fully owned properties in the UK & ROI and will deliver an annual cash rental saving of c. PS30m. We also repurchased one Extra store in the UK. In Central Europe, the reduction in the market value of fully owned property year-on-year reflects the reclassification of a number of mall properties which are held for sale. In the year, we released PS109m of proceeds through the disposal of properties in Poland which were not included as part of the corporate sale. 30 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022",

Having focused on our three turnaround priorities, we are competitive in the UK again, our balance sheet is more secure, and we continue to rebuild trust by operating with transparency. At the same time, feedback from our customers, colleagues, supplier partners and shareholders continues to improve. We have stabilised our business, and now we are rebuilding profitability. But there is much more we want to do. We must keep listening and innovating: we want to offer truly helpful service: and we need to keep unlocking the power and potential of our colleagues. So we have shared our plans to do that. Our six strategic drivers are not new: they have been guiding our efforts throughout much of the last three years. But taken together, they set a clear direction. Our intention is to become even more competitive for customers, simpler for colleagues, and an even better partner for suppliers, while creating long-term value for our shareholders. At the centre of everything is our purpose: to serve shoppers a little better every day. If we keep putting the customer at the heart of our business, and ask ourselves how we can help serve them a little better every day, we can build on the momentum we are showing. There is still work to do, but this year's performance has demonstrated that every little help really can make a big difference at Tesco. Serving shoppers a little better every day. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 2 Introduction This year has been a significant one for Tesco, where, against a challenging external environment, we have continued to make progress against our purpose: to serve shoppers a little better every day. I am grateful to the management team and Tesco colleagues for all that they have done to deliver this. In October, we shared our plans to create long-term value for stakeholders, and in November, Dave Lewis and the management team invited investors, supplier partners and analysts to Tesco's offices in Welwyn Garden City to hear more about the six strategic drivers at the heart of those plans. This report sets out the progress we are making against each of those drivers and tells the story of how we are building on the strong foundations we laid down in the last few years. Although the business has continued to make significant progress this year, across many of our markets we continue to face a challenging operating environment. In the UK, business rates in particular continue to be a considerable burden, and are the biggest tax we have paid this year. John Allan Non-executive Chairman Building on strong foundations. \" I am very pleased to report another strong year of improvement at Tesco. \" We welcome the fact that the UK Government has committed to reviewing the tax framework and look forward to working with them on this. In terms of the Board's support for Tesco's agenda, we have focused on three areas: 1. corporate governance: 2. helping the business to benefit from the expertise of our Board: and 3. exploring opportunities for future growth. Throughout the year, we have continued to focus on strengthened corporate governance. In July, we appointed a new Non-executive Director, Steve Golsby, who brings a deep knowledge of Asia - in particular Thailand, our largest international market. In January, we were pleased that Deanna Oppenheimer accepted the Board's invitation to become Senior Independent Director. Deanna has a wealth of experience, and succeeds Richard Cousins, who decided to step down from the Board. I would like to thank Richard for his strong contributions to Board deliberations and wish him well for the future. Our emphasis on strong governance also extends to issues we have faced within our business. Last November, our Tesco Bank debit cards were the subject of an online fraudulent attack. We acted quickly to ensure customers' accounts were protected and there was no data loss or breach of systems. Shortly after the end of our 2016 17 financial year, we announced that our subsidiary business, Tesco Stores Limited, had reached an agreement on a Deferred Prosecution Agreement in relation to historic accounting practices, and that we had agreed with the UK Financial Conduct Authority to a finding of market abuse. This brings towards a close a challenging time in Tesco's history. The Board will continue to support Dave and the management team in their efforts to restore trust in the Tesco business and brand. Our second focus has been helping the business to benefit from the expertise of our Board. We have had in-depth reviews of our six strategic drivers and risk management, and we have supported the leadership team on talent development and corporate responsibility. Throughout the year, the Board has considered how Tesco can continue to create long-term value for our stakeholders. That included completing a portfolio review. As a result, we have sold Kipa, our retail business in Turkey: garden centre chain Dobbies: Euphorium bakery: Giraffe restaurants: and Harris Hoole coffee shops. All of these businesses have different strengths and potential, but the sales have allowed Tesco's management team to focus on the areas where Tesco can build on its core competencies and unique strengths to create future growth. This focus has allowed us to announce, in January, a proposed merger with Booker Group. This merger builds on Tesco's core strength as a food business and allows both Tesco and Booker to unlock growth in the UK food market in a way that neither would be able to do alone - in particular by focusing on the fast-growing 'out of home' and 'on the go' food markets, to create the UK's leading food business. Reflecting our improved performance and the Board's confidence in Tesco's future prospects, I am pleased to confirm that we intend to recommence paying dividends in respect of the 2017 18 financial year. We expect dividends to grow progressively from that financial year. We are conscious that the Tesco turnaround is a significant project, but I am confident that with the clear plans and superb talent we have in Dave and the whole Tesco team, there is a huge amount of potential to create sustainable, long-term value for all our stakeholders.

The energy and commitment of our 460,000 colleagues has enabled us to make further significant improvements to the way we serve our customers, and we have done this at the same time as increasing operating profit before exceptional items by 30% for the Group. In October 2014, we set out our three turnaround priorities and, in 2016, we shared the detail of the six strategic drivers which are driving our mediumand long-term decisions. This Annual Report gives a high-level overview of those six drivers. The strategic drivers are designed to create sustainable value for our four stakeholders in our business: customers, colleagues, supplier partners, and our shareholders. Customers At the heart of everything we do are our customers. In every decision we take, and every plan we develop, we ask ourselves one simple question: will it help serve shoppers a little better every day? In the year, we'five done a lot to strengthen our customer offer. We're continuing to see a sustained improvement in the feedback we're getting from customers on price, service, quality and availability. We continuously innovate to serve our customers better, and this year we have developed 2,422 new products with our supplier partners, as well as reformulating hundreds more products to make them healthier. We'five also made shopping easier for parents by offering free fruit for children in our large stores. Our prices are lower, with a typical basket of products in the UK costing 6% less than in September 2014. We'five also made our offer simpler, for example by cutting multi-buy promotions by a further 24%. At the same time, we have worked hard to remove reasons for customers to shop elsewhere by introducing seven exclusive fresh food brands, alongside our existing Brand Guarantee. Colleagues Every day, our colleagues go the extra mile to help our customers and it is really encouraging to see this coming through in customer feedback, with a continued increase in ratings of colleague helpfulness through the year. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive \" In every decision, we ask ourselves: how will this help serve shoppers a little better?\" Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 4 Group Chief Executive's statement A strong performance. This has been achieved while at the same time changing the way we serve our customers across our channels, as shopping habits change. Many colleagues have been impacted by the changes we have made to management structures and shift routines, including the move from night-time to day-time replenishment. This makes the feedback from customers even more humbling, and a credit to the unwavering commitment of our colleagues in serving shoppers a little better every day. Creating opportunities for colleagues to get on has been a big focus and will continue to be as our business evolves. This year 4,000 colleagues have been promoted or moved to broader roles across the business. We have welcomed over 100 graduates and supported 1,200 apprenticeships and work placements. Supplier partners Strong partnerships with our suppliers mean we can serve our customers better, invest in innovation and grow our businesses together for the long term. This year we have relaunched our online Supplier Network, which now has over 5,000 members. Reflecting the strength of our partnerships, for the first time we topped the independent supplier survey run by Advantage in October, and our own internal Supplier Viewpoint survey shows that 77% of suppliers are positive about their relationship with us. We were also pleased to be recognised by supply chain body GS1 UK, for leading the industry in supporting small British suppliers. Shareholders In order to share more fully our investment case, we have set out more detail on our medium-term ambitions. In particular, we shared our ambition to deliver a Group operating margin of between 3.5% - 4.0% by our 2019 20 financial year, and we have made good progress towards that ambition this year, with a step up from 1.8% to 2.3% in Group operating margin before exceptionals. We have also announced our intention to recommence paying dividends in respect of the 2017 18 financial year, to return value to shareholders in a way which is sustainable for our business. Governance Following the year-end, we announced a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the UK Serious Fraud Office in relation to historic accounting practices, and an agreement with the UK Financial Conduct Authority to a finding of market abuse. Over the last two and a half years, we have fully cooperated with this investigation, while at the same time taking steps to transform our business. What happened in 2014 is a huge source of regret for all of us, and we are determined to maintain and strengthen the changes we have been making to rebuild trust in our business and brand. As well as bringing this matter towards a conclusion, we have made good progress on wider issues of corporate responsibility. We have made a commitment that by the end of 2017, no food that is safe for human consumption will go to waste from our UK retail operations - and this year we have seen a 148% increase in the amount of surplus food donated to people in need. Future growth In January, we announced a proposed merger with Booker Group, to create the UK's leading food business. Bringing together the complementary skills of retail and wholesale businesses will allow us to unlock new opportunities and to better serve customers with a wide range of high-quality affordable food where they want it, when they want it. I'd like to thank all of my colleagues for everything they have done for our customers and our business this year. We have been through some tough years in rebuilding our business, and I'm continually grateful for everything they do. Our goal now is to go even further together. Over the last year we have turned a corner but, as always, we have more to do. We will keep putting the customer at the heart of the business, and we will continue to work openly and transparently with our supplier partners, our colleagues and every shareholder in our business. We will continue to strive to serve our shoppers a little better every day. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive 5 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Our six strategic drivers set out the plans and aspirations which will create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Maximise the mix to achieve a 3.5% - 4.0% Group margin Building sustainable profitability across our businesses, channels and product ranges. A differentiated brand A strong brand creates long-term value. Our purpose, to serve shoppers a little better every day, is at the heart of what our brand stands for. Maximise value from property Our property strategy is about releasing value from our estate, and repurposing space to enhance our customer offer. Reduce operating costs by PS1.5bn We have undertaken a thorough review of our entire cost base, to identify further opportunities for meaningful savings. Innovation Our innovation strategy is driven by expertise and insight in our three differentiating capabilities: Product, Channel and Customer. Generate PS9bn cash from operations Cash is the lifeblood of our business, and we have set a three-year target to generate PS9bn of cumulative retail cash from operations. 7 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Reduce operating costs by PS1.5bn We'five identified PS1.5bn of potential savings for the years to 2019 20, with particular opportunities to simplify the way we run our stores, modernise our distribution and fulfilment networks, and more efficiently procure goods and services not for resale. This year we have generated PS455m of cost savings, of which PS226m contributes to our PS1.5bn target. Goods not for resale - c. PS500m In our day-to-day operations we purchase a wide range of goods and services not for resale, covering everything from marketing to haulage and consumables. Consolidating our spend with our most important supplier partners has allowed us to make substantial savings - for example by reducing our number of haulage partners in Central Europe from 10 down to three, working across the region. Logistics and distribution - c. PS450m Improving stock flow and increasing the efficiency of our supply chains reduces our costs, and also helps us get products to customers faster - so they benefit from fresher food too. As part of this work, we're changing our distribution network - announcing the closure of our distribution centres in Welham Green and Chesterfield - to ensure that the way we distribute food and goods within our business is as simple and cost-effective as possible. Store operating model - c. PS550m Continuing to improve service in store is our absolute priority, and by recalibrating the way we serve customers we have identified opportunities to increase customer satisfaction while also reducing costs. In our UK stores, we have worked with colleagues to ensure that we schedule hours for when our customers need them most, reducing our night operations and moving replenishment to the daytime. A differentiated brand We are on a journey to rebuild trust in our brand, and we have made significant progress. As the brand strengthens, we invest more in those things that make the Tesco brand and experience unique. Our opportunity is to differentiate through our products and services - with great quality at affordable prices, and a unique Tesco offer - and through customer experience, for example by simplifying our systems for ordering online, and delivering consistently great service in store. With our Brand Guarantee, customers don't have to worry about the price of branded products - which they could get from other retailers - and our own-label products become the point of differentiation, with a unique and helpful offer which gives customers a reason to choose Tesco. We take pride in the quality of our food, and that's reflected in our 'Food Love Stories brought to you by Tesco' campaign, which aims to set out our food quality credentials and celebrate the passion and care that goes into the meals we all love. The six strategic drivers continued Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 8 Our world-class store ordering systems have allowed us to simplify backroom procedures in stores - increasing the amount of stock that goes straight from a delivery onto shelves. This ensures great availability for customers, while also reducing the residual stockholding in store and allowing our colleagues to more efficiently manage stock by only handling a product once. Our 88,000 square feet store in Surat Thani was too large, with an overly-broad range that made the shopping trip harder for customers. We took out around 20% of the retail space, creating room for tenants such as Boots and KFC. These bring new income and attract more customers, with a halo effect on our core retail offer and a resulting increase in retail sales density. Maximise the mix to achieve a 3.5% - 4.0% Group margin By improving profitability and optimising working capital, we will generate positive cash from our retail operations. Cash from operations is the biggest contributor to free cash flow, but working capital is a significant opportunity - with better forecasting, and a tighter assortment of products in our distribution centres, we can reduce stock holding and drive working capital benefits. We are also focused on capital discipline to improve free cash flow and have set rigorous hurdle rates for capital allocation, with a focus on payback periods and maximising returns, in order to balance longer-term investments with projects that will more quickly deliver cash. Maximising the mix means looking at the full picture of everything we do to ensure we are delivering great service for our customers, and driving growth in areas which deliver sustainable profits - in order to achieve a 3.5% - 4.0% Group operating margin by our 2019 20 financial year. We serve shoppers through a wide range of channels and services. To ensure we can deliver these sustainably, we work hard to build long-term profitability - by investing in new areas, and by improving the economics of more recent channels, such as Grocery Home Shopping. We follow this approach in all parts of our business, from choosing how we allocate space in our large stores, to looking at the promotional mix we offer to our online customers. 9 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report We have innovated in our ranges, bringing customers great quality meat and produce at affordable prices through our exclusive fresh food brands. Our innovative Free From range also includes many of the products our customers miss most - like our award-winning Free From Garlic Baguette. In March 2017, we were named Free From Retailer of the Year for the third year running. Maximise value from property We have a significant property portfolio, combining both freehold and leasehold assets. We look closely at opportunities to insulate the business from future rental increases, by carefully optimising our freehold and leasehold mix. Repurposing space - in our stores, malls or car parks - allows us to improve sales densities in our larger stores, while also improving our offer for customers. In the UK we have worked with other leading brands to open 49 concessions in our stores this year, with partners including Arcadia Group and Holland & Barrett. We are also exploring opportunities to release value by selling 'air rights' above a small number of our stores in urban areas - working with a developer to build residential properties above or alongside our stores, without capital investment from Tesco. Innovation By listening to shoppers, and looking at broader customer trends, we can drive innovation in both the products we sell, and the channels through which we sell them. Innovation touches everything we do, from the launch of our PayQwiq digital wallet, making the checkout process easier for customers, to our work on reformulation - taking hundreds of tonnes of salt, sugar and fat out of our own-label products to help customers live healthier lives. The strength of the partnerships we have with our suppliers plays an important role in innovation. By building our businesses together, we also give suppliers the confidence to invest in innovative products and solutions for the benefit of our mutual customers. The six strategic drivers continued Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 10 Our business is organised around the three pillars of Customers, Product and Channels. We place customers at the centre of everything we do to deliver our purpose - serving shoppers a little better every day. Reinvest Our focus is always on making Tesco the best it can be for our customers. The better a job we do for customers, the more we will improve sales: the more our sales improve, the more we can reinvest in further improving the shopping trip. Customers Tesco exists to serve customers - listening to them and acting on what is most important to deliver the best possible shopping trip. Product We build close and mutually-beneficial relationships with our supplier partners, to source the best-possible products that meet and anticipate customers' needs. Channels To bring the best products to customers we work through a range of channels - from small shops to large shops, and our growing online business. 11 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Our business model Sales Profit Cash flow PS49.9bn Group sales exc. fuel a 2015 16: PS47.9bn Increasing volume is key to the success of our business model and both volumes and transactions are increasing as customers are buying more products, more often at Tesco.

A detailed analysis of discontinued operations can be found in Note 7. This was a strong performance for Tesco where we delivered results ahead of expectations. We grew sales, excluding VAT, excluding fuel, by 1.1% at constant rates and we saw positive volume growth in both the UK & ROI and International segments. Group operating profit before exceptional items was PS1,280m, up 29.9% on last year as we continue to rebuild profitability whilst investing in the customer offer. Our statutory profit before tax was down 28.2 % to PS145m including PS 263 m of exceptional costs. We generated retail operating cash flow of PS2.3bn, up 9.1% on last year, including a PS387m improvement pre-exceptionals in working capital, and we also reduced net debt excluding Tesco Bank by 27% to PS 3.7 bn. Now that our business has stabilised we have also shared more detail about our clear plans for the coming years. We are well-placed to deliver our ambition of a Group operating margin of 3.5% - 4.0% by the 2019 20 financial year. This ambition is underpinned by six strategic drivers, including the PS1.5bn operating cost reductions which we are on track to secure over the next three years. Reflecting our improved performance and confidence in future prospects, the Board has reviewed our dividend policy. We intend to recommence paying dividends in respect of the financial year 2017 18. We expect dividends to grow progressively from that financial year with the aim of achieving a target cover of around two times earnings per share over the medium term. \" This was a strong performance for Tesco where we delivered results ahead of expectations. \" com ar2017 to find PDF and Excel downloads of our financial statements. Alan Stewart Chief Financial Officer Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 14 Profit recovery continues. In the UK and the Republic of Ireland ROI, we have now seen five consecutive quarters of like-for-like sales growth. In the UK, volumes grew 1.6% and transactions grew 1.7% as we continued to make fundamental improvements to all aspects of our offer. We saw annual positive like-for-like growth for the first time in seven years and outperformed the market across all categories on a volume basis. Volume outperformance was particularly strong in fresh food, where the exclusive brands we launched in March 2016 have helped to significantly strengthen our value proposition. Significant product cost deflation in the first half of the year eased in the second half. In collaboration with our supplier partners, we have worked hard to minimise the impact of emerging inflationary cost pressures. Despite some inflation in a number of categories, the price of a typical customer basket remains around 6% cheaper than in September 2014 and promotional participation has fallen to 32% as we made a conscious decision to focus our investments on sustainable improvements rather than on short-term couponing and promotions. We achieved improvements in all key customer metrics, including colleague helpfulness and availability, where performance reached record levels. In the Republic of Ireland, like-for-like sales fell by 0.1 % as we continued to invest in lowering prices. We have a leading position in the market in volume terms and have further grown volume share by making improvements across our customer offer, with a focus on fresh produce, meat and bakery. Our full-year UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items was PS803m, up 60% on last year, with margin growth of 68 basis points year-on-year. This improvement includes the impact of investments we have made in all aspects of our offer, particularly in lowering core prices and in the quality and price of the exclusive fresh food brands which we launched in March 2016. These investments enabled us to drive volume growth, generating positive operational leverage. In addition to managing costs more effectively year-on-year, we are also optimising the mix of our offer across channels and products. For example, within our beers, wines and spirits category we have focused on improving the relevance and profitability of our offer by broadening our range of speciality beers, increasing the prominence of own brand products and maintaining a strong, stable core price position in an extremely promotional market.

International sales growth weakened in the second half due to an increasingly competitive environment in Europe, particularly Poland, and as we annualised a strong performance last year in Asia. In the year, we grew like-for-like sales strongly in Thailand as we invested in both lowering prices and improving our fresh food proposition. We grew market share and were pleased to retain our number one position for customers for brand and trust a. In Malaysia, top-line sales growth was held back by weak consumer spending across the market and a trend away from large stores towards convenience shopping, where we are currently under-represented. In Central Europe, like-for-like sales grew in all markets apart from Poland which remains intensely competitive. Positive volume growth in the region was driven by a strong performance in fresh food where we improved quality and inspired customers with new ranges and events.

Whilst we continued to invest in our offer in all of our markets, our response to intense competition in Poland weighed on profitability in Central Europe. We continued to focus on improving our store economics across the region, including simplifying management structures, reducing store administration and closing unprofitable store counters. We also opened a new distribution centre at Poznan in Poland, reducing transport costs for the country by 20%. From April 2017, we have separated the management of our international business, creating two new Executive Committee roles leading Asia and Central Europe, giving greater focus to each region. The introduction of a new retail tax in Poland remains suspended pending the outcome of the European Commission's investigation. We continue to be cautious about potential legislative changes in our European markets. Tesco Bank 2016 17 2015 16 Year-on-year change Revenue PS1,012m PS955m 6.0% Operating profit before exceptional items PS157m PS162m 3.1 % Operating profit PS77m PS161m 52.2 % Lending to customers PS9,961m PS8,542m 16.6% Customer deposits PS8,463m PS7,397m 14.4% Net interest margin 4.0% 4.2% 0.2 % Risk asset ratio 20.0% 20.0% - Tesco Bank continues to provide a simple and transparent product offer to serve the banking and insurance needs of Tesco customers. Active customer account numbers grew by 3.5%, with particularly strong growth in current accounts. We have continued to improve our customer offer by introducing a new premium credit card, simplifying the loan application process by introducing digital signatures, giving interest rate guarantees on current accounts for new and existing customers and through a national roll-out of PayQwiq to all large stores, a digital wallet app that allows customers to pay with their phone in our shops. Operating profit before exceptional items reduced by 3.1 % to PS157m. This decline was due to the full year effect of the introduction of European Commission caps on interchange income which first came into effect in December 2015. Adjusting for this impact, we saw strong profit growth driven primarily by lending income. Exceptional items of PS 80 m relating to Tesco Bank include an increase in the provision for customer redress and a restructuring charge. Risk-weighted assets have risen in line with lending and the Core Tier 1 ratio has improved to 16.7%. The balance sheet remains strong and well-positioned to support future lending growth from both a liquidity and capital perspective. Exceptional items in operating profit 2016 17 2015 16 Net impairment of non-current assets and onerous lease provisions PS 6 m PS 423 m Net restructuring and redundancy costs PS 199 m PS 126 m Provision for customer redress PS 45 m - Interchange settlement PS57m - Property transactions PS165m PS156m Provision for SFO and FCA obligations PS 235 m - Past service credit and associated costs arising on UK defined benefit pension scheme closure - PS480m Total exceptional items in operating profit PS 263 m PS87m Exceptional items are excluded from our headline performance measures by virtue of their size and nature, in order to reflect management's view of the performance of the Group. In the current year, the net effect of exceptional items on operating profit is PS 263 m. Our annual impairment testing resulted in a net charge of PS 6 m. This comprises a net PS103m provision release relating to property, a net increase of PS 56 m in onerous lease provisions and a net PS 53 m impairment charge in goodwill and intangible assets, principally relating to dunnhumby subsidiary, Sociomantic. Net restructuring and redundancy charges of PS 199 m relate principally to changes to our distribution network and store colleague structures and working practices in the UK & ROI, and also includes a PS 35 m charge relating to Tesco Bank business simplification. The provision for customer redress of PS 45 m was recognised in Tesco Bank in the first half, following updated guidance published by the Financial Conduct Authority, proposing an extension to the Payment Protection Insurance settlement deadline which is now set at August 2019. Exceptional items include a credit of PS57m in relation to a legal settlement in respect of interchange fees. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 16 Financial review continued We generated net profits pre-tax of PS165m from property transactions in the year, of which PS91m related to the sale of the Letnany Shopping Mall and Liberec Forum Shopping Centre in the Czech Republic. We also sold a number of properties and development sites in the UK & ROI business. An exceptional charge of PS 235 m has been recorded as an adjusting post balance sheet event, following judicial approval on 10 April 2017 of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement between Tesco Stores Limited and the UK Serious Fraud Office regarding historic accounting practices and an agreement with the UK Financial Conduct Authority of a finding of market abuse in relation to the Tesco PLC trading statement announced on 29 August 2014. Joint ventures and associates, interest and tax Joint ventures and associates Losses from joint ventures and associates before exceptional items increased by PS 9 m to PS 30 m, due to lower profits recognised in our UK property joint ventures. After exceptional items, including an impairment of investment property within Gain Land, our associate in China, and an adjustment in insurance reserves in Tesco Underwriting, our share of post-tax losses from joint ventures and associates rose to PS 107 m from PS 21 m last year. Finance income and costs 2016 17 2015 16 Interest receivable and similar income PS48m PS29m IAS 32 and 39 'Financial instruments' - fair value remeasurements PS61m - Finance income PS109m PS29m Interest payable PS 523 m PS 490 m Capitalised interest PS6m PS6m IAS 32 and 39 'Financial instruments' - fair value remeasurements - PS 19 m IAS 19 net pension finance costs PS 113 m PS 155 m Finance costs PS 630 m PS 658 m Exceptional charge: Translation of Korea proceeds PS 244 m PS 220 m Statutory finance costs PS 874 m PS 878 m Finance income rose to PS109m, mainly due to the favourable effect of marking-to-market financial instruments. These are non-cash adjustments driven by changes in the market's assessment of credit and debt risk. Interest payable increased to PS 523 m due to debt acquired as part of our February 2016 agreement to regain sole ownership of 49 stores and two distribution centres. The impact of this was partially offset by a PS26m reduction in interest following the repayment of debt in the year. Net pension finance costs of PS 113 m reduced in line with the reduction in the opening IAS 19 pension deficit at the start of the 2016 17 financial year. Net pension finance costs are calculated by multiplying the opening net deficit by the opening discount rate each year. For 2017 18, they are expected to increase to c. PS 165 m. An exceptional non-cash loss of PS 244 m arose on the translation of the proceeds from the sale of our Homeplus business in Korea which were held in GBP money market funds in a non-Sterling denominated subsidiary. This does not represent any economic cost to the Group. Group tax Tax on profit before exceptional items was PS 185 m with an effective rate of tax for the Group of 25%. This tax rate is higher than the UK statutory rate primarily due to the impact of the 8% supplementary tax surcharge on bank profits, introduced in January 2016, and depreciation of assets that does not qualify for tax relief. The tax rate benefited from the impact on deferred tax of the expected reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% in 2020. On a statutory basis, including an exceptional credit of PS98m principally relating to a lower book value than tax value of property disposals and tax relief on exceptional impairment and restructuring costs, the tax charge was PS 87 m. The effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items for the 2017 18 financial year is expected to be similar to this year, at around 25%. Earnings per share on a continuing operations basis Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items and net pension finance costs were 7.90p, 41% higher year-on-year principally due to our stronger profit performance. Statutory basic earnings per share from continuing operations were 0.81p, lower than last year driven by higher net exceptional costs. 17 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Strategic report Summary of total indebtedness 2016 17 2015 16 Movement Net debt excludes Tesco Bank PS 3,729 m PS 5,110 m PS1,381m Discounted operating lease commitments PS 7,440 m PS 7,814 m PS374m Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax PS 5,504 m PS 2,612 m PS 2,892 m Total indebtedness PS 16,673 m PS 15,536 m PS 1,137 m Net debt excluding Tesco Bank reduced by PS1.4bn to PS 3.7 bn, as our retail operating cash flow and property and business disposal proceeds were greater than capital expenditure and other charges. We have a strong funding and liquidity profile underpinned by PS4.4bn committed facilities and our key credit metrics fixed charge cover, net debt EBITDA and total indebtedness ratio have improved over the year. Discounted operating lease commitments The reduction in discounted operating lease commitments includes a benefit from the buybacks we have completed in the UK. In the year, we regained sole ownership of 16 superstores from a number of different vendors, resulting in an annual rent saving of PS22m. Pension The IAS 19 pension deficit measure, which relates to our closed UK defined benefit scheme, increased by PS 2.9 bn to PS 5.5 bn due to the reduction in bond yields. Despite this increase in the IAS 19 measure of our liabilities, the actual pension payments that are payable to members in the future have not changed. During the year, we completed a fide-risking programme which has reduced the future volatility of the scheme's long-term funding. At the last triennial valuation, the Trustee and the Company agreed a long-term funding plan where the Company is paying contributions of PS270m a year to the UK defined benefit scheme. The next triennial actuarial valuation is effective as at 31 March 2017 and work is already underway. The Trustee is aiming to conclude the valuation as soon as is reasonably possible. Summary retail cash flow 2016 17 2015 16 Cash flow from continuing operations excluding working capital PS1,695m PS2,033m Increase decrease in working capital underlying decrease in working capital PS387m PS377m impact from exceptional items PS197m PS 91 m cash impact of new approach to supplier payments - PS 231 m Cash generated from operations - continuing operations PS2,279m PS2,088m Cash generated from operations - discontinued operations PS 1 m PS493m Cash generated from operations PS2,278m PS2,581m Interest paid PS 518 m PS 422 m Corporation tax paid received PS 64 m PS125m Net cash generated from retail operating activities PS1,696m PS2,284m Cash capital expenditure PS 1,328 m PS 1,004 m Free cash flow PS368m PS1,280m Other investing activities PS1,620m PS543m Net cash used in from financing activities and intra-Group funding and intercompany transactions PS 1,342 m PS 854 m Net increase in cash and cash equivalents PS646m PS969m Include exclude cash movements in debt items PS1,114m PS4,219m Fair value and other non-cash movements PS 379 m PS 1,817 m Movement in net debt PS1,381m PS3,371m On an underlying basis, working capital improved by PS387m driven by growing sales volumes, initiatives to reduce stockholding and the timing effect of a fuel payment. The reported total reduction in working capital also includes the net impact of exceptional items. Excluding working capital, we generated PS1.7bn of cash from continuing retail operations. The decrease of PS 0.3 bn on the previous year primarily reflects the payment of a turnaround bonus to colleagues in cash rather than shares and higher net exceptional costs than last year. Interest paid was PS 96 m higher than last year due to the debt acquired as part of our February 2016 agreement to regain sole ownership of 49 stores and two distribution centres. The impact of this was partially offset by PS1.2bn of debt we redeemed in September 2016 and a further PS0.7bn of debt we redeemed in January 2017. The cash tax outflow of PS 64 m reflects payments by our international businesses which more than offset a refund of taxes already paid in the UK, as we continue to agree and close historic enquiries into tax returns. Cash movements of PS1.1bn in debt items primarily reflect the redemption of three medium-term notes on their maturity. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 18 Financial review continued Capital expenditure 2016 17 2015 16 UK & ROI PS731m PS676m International PS403m PS254m Tesco Bank PS46m PS40m Group PS1,180m PS970m Capital expenditure excluding buybacks of PS1.2bn was PS0.2bn higher than last year reflecting our planned increase in spend to refresh more than 200 stores in the UK and to accelerate the store opening programme in Thailand. We now expect Group capital expenditure to be around PS1.25bn in 2017 18. This is around PS250m below our original estimate, as we continue to focus on capital spend that delivers attractive returns and move more of our planned technology spend to cloud-based services. There was a net reduction of 2.2 m square feet, which includes 1.7 m square feet related to the disposal of Dobbies garden centres with the balance being net closures of space. In Asia we opened 114 stores, primarily in our convenience format in Thailand. In Europe we closed 23 stores. This year we repurposed just over 1.0m square feet across the Group, improving the ease and relevance of the shopping trip for customers. This included 0.5m square feet in Thailand repurposed for new and existing partners, including five new branches of Decathlon Sports, exclusive in the market to Tesco Lotus, and four new cinemas. In the UK, we repurposed 0.1m square feet in 14 stores, introducing brands such as Miss Selfridge, Wallis and Holland & Barrett. Property 2016 17 2015 16 UK & ROI International Group UK & ROI International Group Property a - fully owned Estimated market value PS13.1bn PS6.7bn PS19.9bn PS13.3bn PS6.4bn PS19.7bn Net book value b PS12.6bn PS5.1bn PS17.8bn PS12.6bn PS5.0bn PS17.6bn % net selling space owned 52% 74% 63% 52% 71% 61% % total property owned - by value c 50% 78% 57% 47% 75% 54% a Stores, malls, investment property, offices, distribution centres, fixtures and fittings and work-in-progress. b Property, plant and equipment excluding vehicles. The estimated market value of our fully owned property has increased by PS0.2bn to PS19.9bn, retaining a surplus of PS2.1bn over the net book value, as the repurchase of 16 stores in the UK and a foreign exchange translation effect more than offset the impact of the sale of Turkey and Dobbies garden centres. Our Group freehold property ownership percentage, by value, has increased from 54% to 57% year-on-year, driven by both the UK & ROI and International. In International, the effect of the sale of our business in Turkey more than offset the impact of the sale of two large freehold shopping centres in the Czech Republic on the mix of freehold to leasehold. In April 2017, we regained ownership of a further seven large stores in the UK with a freehold valuation of PS219m in a transaction with British Land. Including the effect of this transaction, we have now increased our proportion of freehold ownership by value in the UK & ROI to 51%, up by 10% over two years. The repurchase of stores to date has resulted in an annualised saving of PS152m rent, predominantly in relation to fixed-uplift and index-linked rental agreements. The Group operating lease charge reduced by 9% in the year to PS1.0bn. We continue to seek opportunities to further reduce our exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift rent inflation where the economics are attractive. Looking ahead We made good progress over the last year, further strengthening our customer offer and delivering an improvement in profitability a little ahead of expectations. We are confident in the plans we have shared and in the progress we will make this year, including further steps towards reducing our costs by PS1.5bn, generating PS9bn retail cash from operations and improving Group operating margin to between 3.5% and 4.0% by 2019 20. With a much more competitive offer and supplier partnerships as strong as they have ever been, we are much better positioned to navigate challenging market conditions. In January, we announced that we had agreed the terms of a proposed merger with Booker, focused on unlocking new growth, particularly in the faster-growing 'out of home' food market. We are continuing to engage as planned with the Competition and Markets Authority in advance of seeking shareholder approval for the transaction, anticipated in late 2017 early 2018.

      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE Driver": "- **Asset Turnover** has declined significantly from 5.21 to 3.67, indicating a **weaker efficiency** in utilizing assets to generate sales. This drop suggests the company is generating less revenue per unit of asset, which can negatively impact ROE.\n- Conversely, **Profit Margin** improved markedly from a negative -9.22% to a positive 0.25%, reflecting a **substantial turnaround in profitability**. This shift from loss to profit margin indicates better cost management and operational improvements.\n- The **improvement in profit margin** is a positive sign for **investor value creation**, as profitability is a key driver of returns.\n- However, the **decrease in asset turnover** signals a weakening in how effectively the company uses its assets to generate sales, which can offset gains from improved margins.\n- The annual report highlights a **challenge in sales growth and asset utilization**, partly due to store closures and a focus on **reducing selling space**, which explains the asset turnover decline.\n- The turnaround efforts have focused on **improving customer service, stabilizing prices, and operational efficiency**, which contributed to margin improvements.\n- The report signals continued investment in the customer offer and operational improvements, suggesting **asset efficiency may stabilize or improve modestly** in the next quarter and year.\n- Profitability is expected to continue improving but at a measured pace, as the company balances investment with cost control.\n- Overall, the **profit margin is the dominant positive driver** of ROE improvement, while asset turnover is a **weakening factor**.\n- Investors should monitor how well Tesco can **rebuild sales volumes and asset utilization** to complement its improved profitability for sustainable ROE growth.",

We set out to get back to what Tesco has always done best: being the champion for customers: putting customers first: and taking small actions to make big differences. Since then, we have begun to transform our business - from how we are organised to the way we work with our suppliers and ultimately the way that we serve our customers. One of the most important changes we have made over the past year is to set out a new purpose for Tesco: 'Serving shoppers a little better every day. ' This purpose guides all our decisions and shapes every action we take. Alongside our purpose, we have recommitted to three values: Whenever a customer chooses to shop at Tesco, we want their experience to be better than expected and better than the last - from the quality of the offer to the thoughtfulness of the service. With the skills, expertise and dedication of our 476,000 colleagues worldwide, we are well placed to achieve this. By delivering our purpose, and staying true to our values, we can continue to build on the progress we have made this year. This has been a year of real change at Tesco. Our ambition now is to go further and do even more to reduce and simplify prices, improve ranges, continue to innovate and deliver excellent customer service. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 02 Introduction Serving shoppers a little better every day Visit www. com ar2016 to see how we built a temporary store in Carlisle Across the business, we have continued with our wide-ranging corporate renewal plans and I'm pleased to say that these are very much on track. Through making some difficult decisions and putting the customer at the heart of all we do, we are rebuilding the business. It was a difficult decision to sell our Homeplus business in Korea, but it was an important step in repositioning the finances of the Group by generating PS3.3bn of funds. The sale enabled us to take a significant step forward on our priority of strengthening the balance sheet. In addition, replacing the UK defined benefit pension scheme with a defined contribution scheme means we have a plan that is both competitive and sustainable for our colleagues over the long-term. Further information on the work that has taken place during the year can be found in our corporate governance section on page 28. The Board and I feel we have the right balance of skills, experience and backgrounds to support and challenge the management team. The recent appointments of Alison Platt, Simon Patterson and Lindsey Pownall as additional independent Non-executive Directors have further strengthened the Board. Between them, they bring a wealth of customer service, IT and supplier relationships experience and It has been a very challenging year for Tesco, but I remain extremely positive and confident about the future of this great business. Tesco is an iconic brand, a national institution and an enormous employer, so I'm conscious of the huge responsibilities, not just to our customers, colleagues and shareholders, but to all our other stakeholders, including our supplier partners. During the past year, there has been a renewed focus on corporate governance and the Board has spent a significant proportion of its time examining and strengthening our processes throughout the Group. Having a solid governance framework is key to rebuilding trust and transparency. we look forward to working with them to take the Company forward. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Dave Lewis and his senior management team for their continued hard work and dedication. Strong foundations have been laid since we began our turnaround and I believe that we have focused on the right priorities as we continue to rebuild and strengthen the business. A highlight of my year has been getting out into the business and meeting so many of our colleagues, both in the UK and overseas, and seeing the passion and enthusiasm they have for Tesco. During a recent visit to South East Asia, I was delighted to see the recognition Tesco is receiving as a very attractive employer. I want it to be recognised how hard our colleagues have worked during the past year and thank them for their commitment through difficult times. It is important that we get Tesco back to investment grade and paying dividends. We are a business of scale and complexity and have the resources to do a lot. But it will be our relentless focus on meeting customers' needs that will help us to achieve our goals for the long-term success of the Company for the benefit of all our stakeholders. John Allan Non-executive Chairman 03 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Other information Corporate governance Financial statements Strategic report Chairman's statement Strong foundations John Allan Non-executive Chairman Visit www. com ar2016 to hear more from John Allan on his first full year at Tesco In October 2015, we became the first - and still only - retailer in the UK to offer customers an immediate price match at the till with Brand Guarantee, so they never pay more for their branded shop if it's cheaper at Asda, Morrisons or Sainsbury's when they buy 10 or more different products. And just two months ago, we launched a range of exclusive new fresh food brands, which are available only at Tesco and at great prices. These are allowing us to give our customers even more choice in great value, fresh food all under one roof. International sales have also strengthened despite trading in challenging markets, driven by improvements across our offer. We have built up strong positive sales momentum throughout the year in both Europe and Asia. Our largest international business, in Thailand, performed particularly well, culminating in its highest-ever market share. Our transformation programme in Europe has accelerated growth and reduced operating expense. Elsewhere in the Group, Tesco Bank continues to give customers a unique banking offer. And in Tesco Mobile, our joint venture with O 2, we have a successful brand and a business recognised for delivering outstanding customer service. As a result, we have stabilised the business and we are on track with where we expected to be. Of course there is still more to do - but we are on the road to recovery and momentum is building across the business. Our business has always been at its best when we'five made customers our absolute priority. Over the past year, we have restored our total commitment to giving the best possible service to our customers. This is reflected in the new purpose we have set out for the business: serving shoppers a little better every day. This is guiding every action we are taking and has been instrumental in making the UK business competitive again. As well as investing in lower, more stable pricing and improved service and availability, we have reviewed and simplified every one of our food ranges and added thousands of extra colleague hours on the shop floor to improve customer service. On-shelf availability has reached record levels, ensuring customers can get what they want, when they want it. This has been a significant year for Tesco. We have delivered unprecedented change over the past 12 months as we have begun to transform our business. We have taken decisive, immediate action on the challenges we faced. In a very deliberate way we have made the changes needed to re-energise the operation. We have guided our efforts with the three priorities we set out in October 2014: 1. to regain competitiveness in the core UK business: 2. to protect and strengthen the balance sheet: and 3. to rebuild trust and transparency. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 04 CEO's statement Visit www. com ar2016 to hear more from Dave Lewis A year of significant progress Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive Our progress towards rebuilding trust in our brand has been led by the commitment and passion demonstrated by our colleagues. Wherever I travel in our business, I see uplifting evidence of this. I am often humbled at the lengths so many colleagues go to in order to help others. Over the past year, I'five spent a lot of time with colleagues in our stores and seen the commitment to serving our customers. Be it on the shop floor or behind the scenes, there are so many examples where colleagues are going the extra mile to serve shoppers a little better every day. Colleagues have faced unprecedented change, yet the resilience and empathy shown to customers and each other is unwavering. The examples are limitless: from the tiny things that make customers smile to the thoughtful acts that make their day. One of my favourite examples of dedication to our customers is the colleague who spent hours navigating heavy snowfall to hand-deliver shopping to a 96-year-old unable to receive her usual online delivery or to leave her house for groceries. And there are the community and charity projects we can really be proud of too. We'five made a new commitment to ensure all surplus food from Tesco stores in the UK goes to charity and not waste by 2017. Our work with Community Food Connection continues to redistribute surplus food from our stores to local charities to help feed those most in need and we have extended it to over 100 large stores, with plans to roll out to all large stores by the end of 2016. Our charity partnership with Diabetes UK and the British Heart Foundation is the first of its kind and on its way to raising our target of PS30m to promote healthy living. And customers have chosen specific community projects to receive PS11.5m raised from the sale of Tesco bags in the UK since October 2015, donated through Bags of Help - one of the biggest environmental improvement drives the UK has ever seen. As this report describes, we have made significant progress from where we were a year ago. The actions we'five taken to reaffirm our competitiveness in the UK, protect the balance sheet, and rebuild trust and transparency have stabilised our business. As a team, we are committed to serving shoppers a little better every day, in what remains a challenging, deflationary and uncertain market. We are confident that the investments we are making are leading to sustainable improvements for customers whilst creating long-term value for our shareholders. I am sure that it will be another busy year and I'm confident that with the customer at the heart of everything we do, we will continue to rebuild our fortunes as a business. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive By focusing on fixing the fundamentals of the shopping trip for customers, we have seen improving like-for-like trends in all our markets and positive like-for-like growth for the Group as a whole in the fourth quarter. Volumes and transactions are increasing across the Group as customers are buying more of what they need at Tesco. We are rebuilding profitability whilst continuing to invest in our offer for customers and have delivered Group operating profit 1 of PS944m this year, in line with expectations. The long-term health of our balance sheet will be determined by our continued ability to improve profitability and generate cash, and I am pleased to say that we generated PS2.6bn of cash 2 this year - before taking into account the Korean sale proceeds - a significant improvement on last year. We have also taken some important decisions that - whilst difficult - have enabled us to move more quickly towards protecting and strengthening our balance sheet. These include the transition from a defined benefit pension scheme to a defined contribution scheme. We have also carefully negotiated the buy-back of 70 stores out of sale and leaseback structures, removing some of the burden of increased lease commitments and rental inflation. 1 Group operating profit is shown before exceptional items. 2 Cash generated from retail operations. Corporate governance Financial statements Strategic report 05 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Other information food categories, reducing the total number of product lines by 18%. As well as making the range easier for customers to shop, this has helped us to increase on-shelf availability to record levels by providing more space for the products which are purchased most frequently. These changes have been delivered by working closely with our supplier partners. Together, we have moved to a more efficient and sustainable way of working, helping us to further reduce prices for customers. In total, in the year we have brought down the cost of an average weekly shop by over 3%. In addition, by removing inefficiencies in the supply chain, we have been able to provide up to two days' more freshness in our fruit and vegetables. As well as lower, more stable prices, customers want complete peace of mind that they won't lose out at Tesco - even if the products they wish to buy are available on promotion elsewhere. They also prefer simple, immediate value rather than vouchers. In October, we launched our unique Brand Guarantee, reassuring customers that if their branded shop could be found more cheaply elsewhere, we would take the money immediately off their bill. Over the course of this year, we have worked hard to regain our competitiveness - particularly in the UK. To do this, we first listened to our customers and understood what it was that they needed from their shopping trip. They highlighted three main themes: they wanted their shopping trip to be easier: they wanted better availability on the products that matter most, every day: and they wanted lower, more stable prices they can trust all of the time. Over the past year, we have responded. We simplified our store structures, investing in 9,000 more customer-facing roles in store. We have reviewed the range of products we sell in every one of our 33 Brand Guarantee If a customer's branded grocery shop is cheaper at Asda, Morrisons or Sainsbury's, when they buy 10 or more different products, we instantly take the money off the bill at the till. We even compare branded promotions, so customers can check out with confidence there and then. No vouchers, no waiting, no wondering if there's a better deal elsewhere. We'five introduced this because it's the right thing for customers - and we're very proud of it. The progress we have made is being recognised. We measure customer satisfaction through our Customer Viewpoint Survey - a weekly measure that captures direct customer feedback in every store. In total, we have seen an improvement of 5% in the proportion of customers rating overall service and colleague helpfulness as excellent, and every individual measure below this has also improved. The clearest sign that we are more competitive again is that more customers are buying more things at Tesco. We have seen sales volumes and weekly transactions improve throughout the year, generating annual positive volume growth for the first time in five years. Volumes were up 3.3% and transactions were up 2.8% in the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by our progress but we know that there is a lot more we can do and that we can continue to become even more competitive by putting the customer at the heart of every decision we make. 06 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Regaining competitiveness Turnaround priorities For more information visit www. com brandguarantee adopted a new approach to cash payments to suppliers as part of our efforts to build trusted and transparent relationships: and increased our ownership of freehold property, reducing exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift leases. We have begun to make a big cultural shift in the way colleagues think about the finances of the business, with a much improved understanding of the importance of cash. All colleagues are asked to think about the impact they can have on improving the cash flow in the business, whether that be through reducing slow-moving stock in our warehouses or making our shop floor operations more efficient. Our firm focus on generating cash from our trading activities and maintaining discipline in our capital expenditure will be key to making further progress in protecting and strengthening the balance sheet going forward. We have made significant progress towards our aim of protecting and strengthening the balance sheet this year, reducing our total indebtedness by PS6.2bn. A strong balance sheet gives us more flexibility to invest in improving the shopping trip for customers. We have taken a number of actions to strengthen our position: repositioned the finances of the Group through the sale of our Homeplus business in Korea, which itself reduced total indebtedness by PS4.1bn: provided sustainable benefits for colleagues and a greater certainty on future cash requirements by replacing the UK defined benefit pension scheme with a defined contribution scheme: improved the potential for medium-term returns by consolidating the Central European businesses: taken a much more disciplined approach to capital investment and delivered, as planned, a significant reduction in total expenditure: Property ownership Our long-term aim is to increase the ownership of our property and reduce our exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift inflation. In March 2015, we completed an asset swap with British Land, regaining sole ownership of 21 superstores and in February 2016, we regained sole ownership of 49 large stores and two distribution centres from Phoenix Life Assurance and the British Airways Pension Fund. These transactions increased our freehold ownership ratio in the UK & ROI by 6% to 47% and generated a saving in fixed-uplift and index-linked rent of PS115m per annum at current rental levels. We continue to evaluate opportunities to further reduce our exposure to indexed rent inflation. 07 Other information Financial statements Corporate governance Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Strategic report Protecting the balance sheet We also became the first UK retailer to publish payment terms with suppliers. The Supplier Network which we launched at the start of 2015 has now grown to more than 5,000 members, and we set up a special helpline for suppliers to solve any issues that may arise within 48 hours. Our latest Supplier Viewpoint measure of how suppliers view their relationships with Tesco recognises the positive impact of all these changes. The results show a significant improvement year-on-year, increasing from 5 1% to 68% in the UK and from 58% to 70% for the Group as a whole. We have also made a number of changes which aim to help shareholders and other stakeholders understand our performance. These include much greater alignment between the way we run the business internally and the way we report our results externally and a move to operating profit as our headline performance measure, adjusted only for any large and distorting impacts. Tesco today is a very different business. We are proud of how our colleagues and suppliers have responded to the changes we have made. Our customers are noticing the differences too - they're enjoying better service and buying more of what they need at Tesco. And our journey will continue, guided by our commitment to serve shoppers a little better every day. Sadly, trust in our brand has been eroded in recent years. Trust should never be taken for granted and it will take time and perseverance to restore it fully. We are working hard to rebuild that trust with our colleagues, customers, suppliers and other key stakeholders and want to build more open and transparent relationships. We are giving customers lower, simpler and more stable prices to ensure they can trust Tesco to deliver the best shopping trip at the best price. And having listened to customer feedback, we are redirecting promotional spend into shelf-edge prices. In addition, we have completely reorganised our relationships with suppliers. In October 2014, we drew a line under our past and started to reset the way we work. We refocused on new performance measures and retrained our teams. We have fundamentally changed the way we operate and have implemented significant initiatives that improve the way we work with suppliers and our commercial culture, and simplify how we buy and sell. We have completely changed our Product team structure, focusing on getting the offer right for customers and prioritising sales and total profit over margin rate. Dairy farmers The groundbreaking Tesco Sustainable Dairy Group, set up in 2007, continues to give farmers fair prices and deals for their milk. In our commitment to dairy farmers, all Tesco own-label standard-tier yoghurt is now made with milk sourced from Britain with the exception of those with protected origins - including authentic Greek yoghurt and French fromage frais. This has seen us increase the amount of British milk in our standard-range yoghurts from two-thirds to 100% and has increased the demand for milk from farms across the whole country. We have also extended our financial support for First Milk farmers who supply milk for our own-label cheese to help cover production costs throughout the winter and into the spring. 08 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Visit www. com ar2016 to see more about our supplier relationships Turnaround priorities continued Rebuilding trust and transparency Corporate governance 09 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Other information Financial statements Strategic report Our business is organised around the three pillars of Customers, Product and Channels.

We place them at the centre of everything we do to deliver our purpose - serving shoppers a little better every day. 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Business model Keeping it simple Product The offer we create for customers is developed by our Product team. Our ways of working in this team have been rewritten with an absolute focus on fair, transparent, mutually beneficial relationships with suppliers. The Product team work with our suppliers to source the best-possible range of quality products that meet and anticipate our customers' needs.

We are committed to becoming more efficient and reinvesting some of the savings we make to improving the shopping trip. The reason for this reinvestment is clear: the better a job we do for customers, the more we will improve sales: the more our sales improve, the more we can reinvest.

We achieved positive like-for-like sales growth in both Asia and Europe in the second half, driven by improvements across our offer with a particular emphasis on price and fresh foods. We delivered market share gains in five of our seven international markets. In Central Europe, the restructure of the management team for Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia is complete and moves us from operating as four individual country teams to one single regional team. We are in the process of moving to an operating model which will create substantial buying and operational synergies and help us to fund further improvements in the customer offer. International profits increased by 11.4% at constant exchange rates to PS277m, with margin growth of 138 basis points between the first and the second half. The 'food supervision fee' which had been proposed in Hungary was not introduced and therefore has no impact on these results. We continue to be cautious about potential legislative changes in our European markets. Following investments in the offer in both Asia and Europe, we have seen improving like-forlike sales growth and we are beginning to generate positive operational gearing. trend through the year in both customer numbers and volume growth. Full-year UK sales declined by 0.4 % on a 52-week basis, reflecting both an improving trajectory in our like-for-like sales performance and a declining contribution from net new store space, due to store closures. UK like-for-like sales, excluding VAT and excluding fuel, fell by 0.6 % in the year but improved over the course of the year, rising by 0.9% in the fourth quarter driven by a strong performance across all our store formats and product categories. High levels of deflation persisted due to our own price investments in addition to commodity price decreases. In the Republic of Ireland, we made a significant investment to ensure our customers receive the most competitive offer possible. Like-for-like sales performance turned positive in the fourth quarter for the first time since 2012. Our full-year UK & ROI operating profit before exceptional items was PS505m, with margin growth of 81 basis points between the first and the second half. This improvement marks the next stage of our journey to rebuild profitability from the losses we made in the second half of 2014 15. We have made permanent reductions to our cost base, transformed the way we work with suppliers, started to generate leverage through increasing sales volumes and begun to improve productivity throughout our operations. 15 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Other information Corporate governance Financial statements Strategic report Segmental results continued Tesco Bank This year Year-onyear change Revenue PS955m 0.8% Operating profit before exceptional items PS162m 13.8 % Lending to customers PS8,542m 10.6% Customer deposits PS7,397m 7.0% Net interest margin 4.2% 0.0% Risk asset ratio 20.0% 1.2% Tesco Bank continues to offer customers a differentiated banking and insurance offer, with 7.6 million accounts at the year-end. Active customer account numbers have grown by 1.0%, supported by a strengthened customer proposition including higher value personal loan products, 95% loan-to-value mortgages and the removal of monthly current account fees. Customer lending increased by 10.6% to PS8.5bn, with strong growth in mortgage balances. Operating profit before exceptional items reduced by 13.8 % to PS162m. This decline was primarily due to the introduction of European Commission caps on interchange income from December 2015, following the initial reduction driven by MasterCard's agreement with the Competition and Markets Authority last April. The full-year effect of this change will be felt in the 2016 17 financial year. Risk-weighted assets have risen in line with lending and the Core Tier 1 ratio has improved to 16.6%. The balance sheet remains strong and well-positioned to support future lending growth from both a liquidity and capital perspective.

In the current year, the net effect of exceptional items on operating profit is PS102m, with a mix of both charges and credits: An information technology impairment and asset write-off of PS 275 m, as we move towards a single online platform for customers and a net non-cash property impairment and onerous lease provision of PS 133 m, including write-downs of  and non-trading sites of PS 109 m. A UK & ROI net restructuring and redundancy charge of PS 126 m relates principally to store colleague structures and working practices changes and business rationalisation, and is partially offset by the release of a prior year provision. We generated net profits pre-tax of PS156m from property transactions. In order to increase our freehold ownership and reduce our exposure to indexed rent reviews, we regained sole ownership of 70 stores and two distribution centres in transactions with British Land in March 2015, and Phoenix Life Assurance and the British Airways Pension Fund in February 2016. In October 2015, we agreed the sale of 14 sites in the south of England to Meyer Bergman for mixed-use and residential development, generating cash proceeds of PS218m in the year. Following the closure of our UK defined benefit pension scheme in November, a non-cash actuarial credit of PS538m has been recognised, as all accrued deferred pension benefits now increase in line with the consumer price index, rather than the retail price index. This was partly offset by a PS 58 m charge related to the scheme closure, including a payment to members, equivalent to one week's pay and capped at PS500 per colleague, paid directly into a new defined contribution scheme. Last year, we recognised exceptional items of PS 6.7 bn, of which around PS 0.6 bn was linked to a direct future cash outflow. 16 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Visit www. com ar2016 to find PDF and Excel downloads of our financial statements Financial review continued Joint ventures, interest and tax Joint ventures and associates Losses from joint ventures and associates increased by PS 8 m to PS 21 m, due to a higher level of losses from our partnership with CRH in China in addition to a lower initial level of dunnhumby profitability following the restructure of our relationship with Kroger in April 2015. These impacts were partially offset by increased profits recognised on our UK property joint ventures. Finance costs and income This year Last year Interest receivable and similar income PS29m PS80m Finance income PS29m PS80m Interest payable PS 504 m PS 535 m Capitalised interest PS6m PS44m IAS 32 and 39 'Financial instruments' - fair value remeasurements PS 19 m PS 26 m IAS 19 net pension finance costs PS 155 m PS 134 m Finance costs PS 672 m PS 651 m Exceptional charge: Translation of Korea proceeds PS 220 m - Statutory finance costs PS 892 m PS 651 m Taxation Tax on profit before exceptional items was PS 8 m with an effective rate of tax for the Group of 3%. This tax rate is lower than the UK statutory rate primarily due to a lower book value than tax value of property assets disposed of in the year, partially offset by unrecognised tax losses. On a statutory basis, including an exceptional credit of PS86m relating to a release of provisions in respect of uncertain tax positions following settlement of a number of historic enquiries relating to years up to 2011, there is a tax credit of PS54m. The effective underlying tax rate for the 2016 17 financial year is expected to be around 30%. Interest receivable and other income decreased by PS 51 m to PS29m, due to reduced income from debt-hedging swaps. Finance costs increased by PS21m to PS 672 m. Interest payable includes an overall reduction of PS49m in interest costs on bonds and medium term notes, which was largely offset by the unwinding of the discount on onerous lease provisions. The prior year also included set-up costs relating to new credit facilities. Capitalised interest reduced by PS38m, reflecting a lower level of work-in-progress. Net pension finance costs of PS 155 m rose in line with the opening pension deficit, offset in part by a lower opening discount rate. An exceptional non-cash loss of PS 220 m arose on the translation of the proceeds from the sale of our Homeplus business in Korea, which are held in GBP money market funds in a non-Sterling denominated subsidiary. This does not represent any economic cost to the Group. Earnings per share Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items were 3.41p, down 17.6 % on last year despite a lower tax charge due to higher net finance costs. Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items and net pension finance costs were 4.97p, 9.1 % lower year-on-year. Statutory diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were higher than last year at 2.76p reflecting significant exceptional items in the prior year. 17 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Other information Corporate governance Financial statements Strategic report Pension In November 2015, we replaced our defined benefit pension scheme with a defined contribution scheme, providing sustainable benefits for colleagues and greater certainty on future cash requirements. On an accounting basis, the Group's net pension deficit after tax decreased from PS 3.9 bn last year to PS 2.6 bn at the year-end. This was driven by a recalculation of the deficit following the closure of the UK defined benefit scheme and an increase of 30 basis points in real corporate bond yields, leading to a corresponding increase in the discount rate used to measure our long-term liabilities. In accordance with the long-term deficit funding agreement with the Trustee of PS270m per annum in place since April 2015, a cash contribution of PS249m was made to the scheme. Following the significant reduction in future pension risk, by closing the defined benefit scheme, the Trustee is now working with its advisers and the Company to reduce risk further, by beginning to implement an asset derisking strategy. Discounted operating lease commitments Discounted operating lease commitments reduced by PS1.5bn in the year, including a PS0.8bn reduction arising from the sale of our Homeplus business in Korea.

In this measure of indebtedness, we include net debt, discounted lease commitments and our net pension liability as measured by IAS 19. Our firm focus on generating cash from our trading activities and maintaining discipline in our capital expenditure will be key to making further progress in protecting and strengthening the balance sheet going forward.

We generated PS2.2bn cash from continuing and discontinued retail operations and improved working capital by PS0.4bn. On an underlying and continuing operations basis, working capital improved by PS0.4bn driven by a PS0.3bn reduction in inventory with improvements evident in all areas of the Group and a PS0.1bn inflow from trade We completed three property transactions, regaining ownership of 70 stores and two distribution centres which reduced discounted lease commitments by a further PS0.6bn. With some of our lease agreements, we have an option on a specific date to buy back the property or to buy back the equity of our joint venture partner at market value. As we are not obliged to make lease payments after the buy-back date, we do not include these as part of our indebtedness. If we were to include them, it would increase our lease commitments by PS2.6bn. balances, including an improvement from an increased focus on up-front unit price. Additionally, there was a PS0.3bn inflow generated by our discontinued business in Korea up to the point of disposal. The overall reduction in working capital also includes the net impact of exceptional items of PS 0.1 bn and the first half PS 0.2 bn outflow relating to the new approach to cash payments to suppliers which we outlined last year. Interest paid was PS187m lower than last year as three medium term notes which matured in the prior year were refinanced at lower rates. In addition, timing differences resulted in a lower number of instalments requiring payment in 2015 16 than the prior year. Cash tax was a net refund of PS125m, which arose primarily as tax losses made in the 2014 15 financial year were carried back to offset against taxable profits from 2013 14. Cash movements of PS4.2bn in debt items primarily reflect the proceeds from the sale of our Homeplus business in Korea, which have been placed in short-term investments. Fair value and other non-cash movements include PS1.5bn of debt acquired when we regained sole ownership of 70 stores and two distribution centres. 18 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Financial review continued Property UK & ROI International Group Property 1 - fully owned - Estimated market value PS13.3bn PS6.4bn PS19.7bn - Net book value 2 PS12.6bn PS5.0bn PS17.6bn % net selling space owned 52% 71% 61% % total property owned - by value 3 47% 75% 54% 1 Stores, malls, investment properties, offices, distribution centres, fixtures and fittings and work-in-progress. 2 Property, plant and equipment excluding vehicles. Capital expenditure This year Last year UK & ROI PS0.7bn PS1.3bn International PS0.3bn PS0.4bn Tesco Bank - PS0.1bn Group PS1.0bn PS1.8bn Capital expenditure was PS1.0bn, a decrease of PS0.8bn year-on-year, with lower spend in each region. Group capital expenditure in 2016 17 will be around PS1.25bn including an increased spend to refresh UK stores and an accelerated store-opening programme in Thailand. Our long-term aim is to increase the ownership of our property and reduce our exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift inflation. The March 2015 asset swap with British Land and February 2016 transactions with Phoenix Life Assurance and the British Airways Pension Fund, through which we regained sole ownership of 70 large stores and two distribution centres, enabled us to increase the proportion of freehold property in the UK & ROI by 6% to 47%. These transactions resulted in a combined saving in fixed-uplift and index-linked rent of PS115m per annum at current rental levels. The sale of our property assets within the disposal of our business in Korea drove the year-on-year reduction of PS3.2bn in the estimated market value of fully-owned property across the Group to PS19.7bn at year-end. This valuation gives an estimated surplus of PS2.1bn over the net book value, with our Group freehold ownership percentage now 54% by value and 61% by selling space, an increase of 5% by value and 3% by selling space on last year. This estimated market value excludes our share of property joint ventures. Including this, the valuation would increase by PS0.2bn, net of the debt in the joint ventures. The Group operating lease charge reduced by 10% in the year to PS1.2bn and we continue to evaluate opportunities to further reduce our exposure to index-linked and fixed-uplift rent inflation. Based on current rent, around three-quarters of our UK lease charge relates to fixed-uplift or index-linked rental agreements. Outlook We have made good progress over the last year. We are continuing to invest in our customer offer in order to improve our competitiveness in what remains a challenging, deflationary and uncertain market. This will be reflected in the pace of improvement in profitability in the current year, particularly in the first half. We are increasingly confident that the actions we are taking are leading to sustainable improvements for customers and will result in a continued improvement in profitability and the creation of long-term value for shareholders. This year, we closed more selling space than we opened, leading to a net reduction of 1.2 m sq. Internationally, we reduced net space by 0.4 m sq. ft. of existing space in Asia and 0.3 m sq. ft. of closures in Europe more than offset our reduced opening programme. 19 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Other information Financial statements Corporate governance Strategic report Alan Stewart Chief Financial Officer We have performed a robust and systematic review of those risks that we believe could seriously affect the Group's performance, future prospects, reputation or its ability to deliver against its priorities. We maintain a Group Risk Register of the principal risks faced by the Group. Our risk management process is operated throughout the Group. All business units perform regular risk assessments that consider and assess the Group's principal risks and specific local risks pertinent to the market in which they operate. This process ensures a consistent approach to the assessment of risk across the Group as well as informing the Group risks from a bottom-up perspective. The content of the Group Risk Register is considered and discussed through regular meetings with senior management and reviewed by the Executive Committee and the Board. As part of a wider and ongoing process to enhance our risk management activities and capabilities, we have refreshed the process by which Tesco evaluates and reports principal risks and uncertainties. We show the alignment of our risks to our priorities by principal risk in the table on page 25. In some cases a change of emphasis in the risk reflects both the external and internal business environment, including wider economic factors facing our Group that have also been considered as part of this process. Key to risk movement Risk increasing No risk movement Risk decreasing This development of our risk process has resulted in the inclusion of liquidity risk as a principal risk in this section. In our Annual Report 2015, this risk was included as part of a separate financial risks review, now set out in Note 22 on page 123 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016. Our process for identifying and managing risk is set out in more detail on page 47 of the corporate governance report. The table on page 25 sets out our principal risks, their movement during the year and examples of controls and mitigating factors. A significant process for the enhancement of our internal control environment is under way. The risks identified do not comprise all of the risks associated with our business and are not set out in priority order. Additional risks not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse effect on the business.

We are unable to build and sustain loyalty resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results. Link to priorities We are addressing the challenge of changing customer wants and increased customer choice as a result of heightening competitive activity. The customer need is central to our decision-making. We have developed strategic plans to enhance our understanding of our customer needs. Customer insight supports development of customer-focused strategies across each market and we have developed strategic customer profiles to understand specific market expectations. We have invested in the customer experience by increasing colleague hours on the shop floor and by providing further customer service training for colleagues across all stores. We continue to invest in availability and price as well as running our Feet on the Floor programme - whereby non-store colleagues spend a day on the shop floor to ensure customer focus is maintained. Transformation of economic model The transformation of our economic model does not allow us to respond to changes in the external economic environment, nor does it progress sufficiently quickly to maintain or increase operating margin, to generate sufficient cash to meet business objectives. This may result in an adverse impact on the business and shareholder confidence. Link to priorities We are in the process of transforming our business and how we operate to drive improvement and better performance. Significant transformation programmes are being undertaken across the Group, including organisational design, data strategy, reset of supplier relationships, cost reduction and people & capability. There is Executive Committee and Board overview of key strategic initiatives to improve sales and margin, and to reduce cost. Periodic sales margin planning and forecasting activity are reviewed by Group and local finance functions. Liquidity Business performance does not deliver cash as expected: access to funding markets or facilities is restricted: failures in operational liquidity management: Tesco Bank cash call: or adverse changes to the pension deficit funding requirement, create calls on cash higher than anticipated, leading to impacts on financial performance, cash liquidity or the ability to continue to fund operations. Link to priorities We have a strong focus on improved liquidity management and have taken a number of steps to address this. The funding plan and its key elements e. g. debt issuance, cash resources, available credit facilities and cash flow forecasting are subject to regular executive review, supported by rolling liquidity updates and key financial metrics. Treasury and debt-related policies covering UK and International markets are in place and periodic reviews of the Going Concern and Longer Term Viability Statement is undertaken by the Audit Committee and the Board. Following the significant reduction in future pension risk by closing the UK defined benefit scheme, we are implementing a derisking strategy to further reduce pension risk and better match our cash flows. Specific activities have been undertaken to reduce our debt-level with enhanced cost control measures in place. Further information on these risks can be found in Note 22 on page 123 of the financial statements. Whilst Tesco Bank is financially separate from Tesco PLC, there is a regular review of Tesco Bank's risk appetite by Tesco Bank Board and the Tesco PLC Board. This sets out Tesco Bank's key risks, their optimum ranges, alert limits, controls and tolerance limits and ensures ongoing awareness of any potential risk to Tesco PLC. Competition and markets We do not have an effective, coherent and consistent strategy to respond to our competitors and changing markets, resulting in a loss of market share and failure to improve profitability. Link to priorities We face the ongoing challenge of a changing competitive landscape and price pressure across most of our markets. Executive oversight and ownership of business plans provide strategic direction for the Group with plans regularly reviewed and challenged. Dedicated Board strategy days are held to develop and challenge strategic direction. The use of market scanning and ongoing competitor analysis provides insight, an ability to anticipate market movements and develop an effective proposition. We remain closely aligned with local trade associations, governments and other policy makers across our markets. We have realigned our individual European businesses to sit within a simplified Central European structure under a single management team to provide greater clarity and a consistent strategic approach. 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 25 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Other information Financial statements Strategic report Corporate governance Principal risk Risk movement Key controls and mitigating factors Brand, reputation and trust Failure to manage our brand means we are unable to consolidate loyalty and rebuild trust, creating a perception among customers, colleagues, communities and suppliers that result in a loss of market share or unfavourable effects on our ability to do business. Link to priorities We are working to ensure that we rebuild trust and transparency across our stakeholders through initiatives such as price transparency, Brand Guarantee and the launch of new fresh-food brands. This helps to ensure that our brand perception reflects the values that we demonstrate. Brand guidelines have been updated to provide Group-wide consistency over the use of the Tesco brand. Group commercial and corporate affairs policies and procedures have been updated. Communications, media relations and corporate responsibility plans are in place and include internal and external stakeholder engagement. There is a Group Corporate Responsibility Committee that oversees corporate responsibility activity. The Code of Business Conduct has been refreshed with specific guidance over brand, social media and communications, ethical trading and the establishment of a tone at the top with defined consequences in the event of non-compliance. Technology A significant failure of IT infrastructure or key IT system results in loss of information, inability to operate effectively and or financial or other regulatory penalties. Link to priorities Our IT landscape requires further investment in core infrastructure and data centres, as well as to support the store environment. Controls include a technology strategy outlining a number of approved technology policies and procedures. The Technology leadership team provides central governance across major project approval, configuration changes, application updates and the development of new systems. We are increasing our investment in IT with a fully-funded development plan covering a range of back office and customer systems. Technology assessments are performed on an ongoing basis to identify further areas of need and opportunities for improvement. Data security and data privacy Failure to maintain control over customer, colleague, commercial and or operational data leads to a loss of data, either through deliberate targeted action or inadvertent error. The misuse of personal data, for example without the customer's consent or retaining for longer than is necessary, may also result in reputational harm, regulatory investigations and potential fines. Link to priorities We operate a large number of disparate IT systems, some of which are legacy systems and we hold significant amounts of sensitive data in a number of locations. Our systems are secured with access controls, while regular vulnerability and penetration testing provides additional security. Compliance assessments are executed across UK and international business units against the information security policies. We are strengthening our data-related controls as part of a significant IT security improvement programme. The strengthening includes enhanced information security policies and governance, review of defence measures against attacks and continued migration away from unsupported systems. A Group-wide, comprehensive privacy compliance programme is being developed, which covers governance, risk assessment, policies and processes, training, incident management, monitoring and review. This is designed to drive the right behaviours and ensure obligations are met with regards to the handling of personal data. Regulatory and compliance Failure to comply with legal or regulatory requirements relating to our business activities, resulting in reputational damage, fines or other adverse consequences including criminal penalties and consequential litigation, adverse impact on our financial results or unfavourable effects on our ability to do business. Link to priorities Our regulatory and legal landscape continues to evolve in all of our locations, and across each of our businesses. There is a risk of breach of existing legal or regulatory requirements, and of not adapting our business as demands change. There are specific actions under way to address matters identified last year relating to commercial income and supplier relationships. The Group-wide Code of Business Conduct has been refreshed, with specific compliance programmes existing around key legislation e. g. UK Bribery Act, built around a risk and compliance model. Colleagues in high-risk areas receive annual training and a communications programme supports ongoing awareness of Code and other regulatory risks. Leadership teams are trained on their regulatory duties and receive management data on compliance risks and breaches. Groceries Supply Code of Practice GSCOP compliance is addressed in a number of ways, including through a GSCOP audit and monitoring programme and the appointment of a Code Compliance Officer. Equivalent legislation will be issued in ROI in 2016 and steps are being taken to prepare for this. There is an externally managed whistleblowing service across the Group for colleagues and suppliers except Thailand, where it is internally managed and a supplier helpline for the anonymous reporting of inappropriate conduct. Tesco Bank's Board oversees Tesco Bank's compliance with regulatory requirements. 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 26 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Principal risks and uncertainties continued Principal risk Risk movement Key controls and mitigating factors Safety We do not meet safety standards in relation to workplace or product, resulting in death, injury or illness to customers, colleagues, or third parties. Link to priorities We continue to focus our efforts on controls to ensure workplace and product safety. For workplace safety, controls include Group safety policies and procedures, Group safety standards and rapid escalated incident-reporting to the CEO. Implementation is driven by a dedicated Group Safety function, which provides advice to the Group on safety matters across geographies. A framework for standardised safety risk assessments has been developed. An extensive programme of technical product testing and reporting is in place with country teams responsible for the delivery and implementation of product safety policies and systems. We are proud to make the results of our provenance-testing publicly available. A supplier audit programme is in place to monitor product integrity and labour standards, which includes unannounced specification inspections of supplier facilities and products. People Failure to attract, motivate and retain the most talented colleagues and develop the required culture, leadership and behaviours to meet our purpose, resulting in an inability to achieve our business objectives. Link to priorities Our people are our most valuable asset. We continue to manage and consider diversity and inclusion as well as colleague engagement. Standardised recruitment policies and processes have been established and a Boardsponsored people strategy is being implemented to attract and retain the best people. Diversity and inclusion are key elements of our people agenda. Remuneration policies and succession planning are subject to periodic benchmarking to ensure they remain appropriate for the Group. We provide ongoing opportunities for personal and professional development through our established leadership development and graduate programmes. 'Our Tesco' and 'What Matters To You?' initiatives allow us to connect, listen and respond to our colleagues. The consolidation of our UK offices into a single campus and the restructure of our Central European businesses has created an environment that fosters improved communication and collaboration between teams. Tesco Bank Continual and progressive changes in the regulatory environment in which the Bank operates could impact the level of capital and liquidity that is expected to be held. Regulatory uncertainty could also impact the future earnings profile of the Bank. Link to priorities The Bank actively manages its response to proposed regulatory changes and has a track record of adapting activities in advance of the implementation of regulatory change. There is Bank Board reporting throughout the year in line with relevant regulatory requirements, with updates to the Tesco PLC Audit Committee by the Bank CFO Audit Committee Chairman. A member of the Tesco PLC Board is also a member of the Bank's Board. The Bank has formed good working relationships with the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and is also a member of the British Bankers Association. Through these relationships, the Bank is able to adopt a proactive approach to engaging in proposed regulatory change. The Bank monitors proposed regulatory guidance and changes during consultation and implementation phases. As a result, the Bank would expect to have sufficient time to respond and adapt its funding and business plans as appropriate. The Bank has a defined risk appetite which is approved and reviewed regularly by both the Bank's Board and the Tesco PLC Board. The risk appetite defines the type and amount of risk that the Group is prepared to accept to achieve its objectives and forms a key link between the day-to-day risk management of the business, its strategic priorities, long-term plan, capital planning, liquidity management and stress testing. Adherence to risk appetite is monitored through a series of ratios and limits. 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 Longer Term Viability Statement The Directors have assessed the viability of the Company over a three-year period, taking into account the Company's current position and the potential impact of scenarios arising from the principal risks set out above. Based on the results of our testing of a number of severe but plausible scenarios, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due during this period. The Directors have determined that a three-year period is an appropriate timeframe for assessment given the dynamic nature of the retail sector and is in line with the Company's strategic planning period. We have based our assessment on our current long-term plan, which makes assumptions relating to: the prevailing economic climate and global economy: the structural challenges facing our sector: and the costs associated with delivering our strategy. Against this we have conducted sensitivity analysis and modelled a range of scenarios including reverse stress-testing based on the materialisation of principal risks, including market and competition, economic and technology failure, which would result in declining sales and increased margin pressures. Our principal risks are identified through our risk management process, which relies on our judgement of risk likelihood and their potential impacts, whilst also understanding the existing mitigations and developing further appropriate controls. The principal risks faced by the Company are recorded on a Group Risk Register, which is considered and discussed through regular meetings with senior management and reviewed by the Executive Committee, relevant sub-committees and the Board. We have considered our principal risks and risk appetite against our strategic objectives. This Strategic report, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, has been approved and signed on behalf of the Board.

      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE": "- **Return on Equity (ROE)** has **deteriorated significantly** from a positive 6.62% in the previous year to a negative 81.19% in the current year, indicating a severe decline in profitability relative to shareholders' equity.  \n- The company reported a **statutory loss before tax of \u00a36.4 billion**, largely driven by substantial **one-off charges totaling \u00a37.0 billion**, which have negatively impacted net income and equity returns.  \n- The **reduction in ROE** is primarily due to these **non-cash impairments, restructuring costs, and adjustments related to the commercial income issue**, reflecting past underperformance and operational challenges.  \n- **Trading profit declined by 58.1% to \u00a31.4 billion**, highlighting weakening core operational profitability, especially in the UK, which represents over two-thirds of sales.  \n- The company\u2019s **balance sheet leverage increased to \u00a321.7 billion**, fueled by higher net debt and pension liabilities, imposing financial strain and limiting shareholder value creation.  \n- The management is focused on **three strategic priorities: regaining UK competitiveness, strengthening the balance sheet, and rebuilding trust**, which are essential to reversing the negative ROE trend.  \n- Early signs of recovery include **improvements in like-for-like sales volumes and customer footfall**, suggesting the operational turnaround efforts are beginning to gain traction.  \n- However, the company warns of **continued market volatility and challenging trading conditions** in the near term, implying ROE may remain under pressure in the next quarter.  \n- Over the next year, if management successfully implements its restructuring and reinvestment plans, **ROE could improve gradually** but will likely remain below historical averages until profitability stabilizes.  \n- For shareholders, this means **returns are currently negative and recovering slowly**, requiring patience and confidence in the company\u2019s long-term strategic execution to restore value.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE Driver": "- The **Asset Turnover** ratio increased significantly from 4.08 to 5.21, indicating a notable improvement in the company's ability to generate sales from its asset base. This suggests enhanced **asset efficiency** and better utilization of resources to drive revenue.\n- Conversely, the **Profit Margin** deteriorated sharply from a positive 1.53% to a negative -9.22%, reflecting a substantial decline in profitability and indicating the company is currently incurring losses on each unit of sales.\n- The sharp decline in profit margin overwhelmingly outweighs the gains in asset turnover, resulting in a weakened overall **Return on Equity (ROE)** from an investor\u2019s perspective.\n- The negative profit margin is consistent with the reported **statutory loss before tax of \u00a36.4 billion**, driven by significant **one-off charges** including impairments, restructuring costs, and commercial income adjustments.\n- The report highlights operational challenges such as **underperformance in the UK core market**, **competitive pressures**, and **the commercial income issue**, which have adversely impacted profitability.\n- The company is actively pursuing a turnaround strategy focused on **regaining competitiveness, strengthening the balance sheet, and rebuilding trust**, which could gradually improve profit margins.\n- The increase in asset turnover aligns with initiatives to improve sales volume and store efficiency, as noted in the management commentary emphasizing \"steady increase in footfall and volumes\".\n- However, near-term profitability recovery may be hampered by ongoing restructuring costs and investment in service and price competitiveness.\n- Over the next quarter and year, asset efficiency is expected to improve modestly due to operational changes, but **profitability will likely remain under pressure** until cost savings and customer trust restoration efforts materialize.\n- Overall, the **profit margin weakness is the dominant factor** negatively impacting ROE, while improved asset turnover provides a positive but insufficient offset.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of Risk": "- **Gearing ratio** has more than doubled from 2.09 to 4.31, indicating a significant increase in the company\u2019s leverage and financial risk.\n- **Current and quick ratios** have both declined, with the current ratio falling below 1 (0.60) and quick ratio to 0.15, signaling potential liquidity challenges and reduced short-term financial flexibility.\n- **NLP financial risk** has increased from 0.79 to 0.84, reflecting heightened financial risk perception in the textual disclosures.\n- **NLP legal and tax risks** have decreased (legal from 0.76 to 0.61; tax from 0.60 to 0.56), suggesting some mitigation or reduced emphasis on these risks compared to the prior year.\n- The **NLP specificity** metric, measuring disclosure clarity, has slightly improved from 0.0709 to 0.0720, implying marginally more precise reporting.\n- **Sentence length and depth** have decreased slightly, indicating simpler and potentially more accessible language for investors.\n- The reduction in language complexity combined with improved specificity suggests a move toward **greater transparency** and less obfuscation in risk reporting.\n- Key risk factors such as **financial leverage and liquidity** have intensified, while **legal and tax concerns** appear less pronounced.\n- The company\u2019s focus on governance, restructuring, and risk management, as outlined, signals efforts to control and reduce future risks.\n- However, given the current elevated gearing and liquidity constraints, **short to medium-term financial risks are likely to remain elevated** despite improvements in transparency and some risk areas.",
      "summary": "- The company\u2019s **Return on Equity (ROE)** has plummeted from a positive 6.62% to a negative 81.19%, driven by a **statutory loss before tax of \u00a36.4 billion** and significant **one-off charges totaling \u00a37.0 billion**.  \n- A sharp deterioration in **profit margin** from 1.53% to -9.22% overwhelmingly offsets a positive increase in **asset turnover** from 4.08 to 5.21, reflecting weak profitability despite improved asset utilization.  \n- **Trading profit declined by 58.1% to \u00a31.4 billion**, highlighting operational challenges, especially in the UK market, which accounts for over two-thirds of sales.  \n- The company\u2019s **gearing ratio more than doubled to 4.31**, with liquidity metrics worsening\u2014**current ratio dropped to 0.60** and **quick ratio to 0.15**\u2014indicating elevated financial and liquidity risks.  \n- Increased **balance sheet leverage of \u00a321.7 billion** and higher **net debt and pension liabilities** contribute to financial strain and limit shareholder value creation.  \n- Despite these challenges, management\u2019s strategic focus on **regaining UK competitiveness, strengthening the balance sheet, and rebuilding trust** is beginning to yield early improvements in **like-for-like sales volumes and customer footfall**.  \n- The company\u2019s risk disclosures show **improved transparency** with simpler language and higher specificity, even as **financial leverage and liquidity risks remain elevated**.  \n- The ongoing restructuring and reinvestment efforts are expected to gradually improve **profit margins and ROE**, though near-term profitability pressures persist due to continued **restructuring costs and market volatility**.  \n- Shareholders should expect **negative returns in the short term**, requiring patience and confidence in management\u2019s execution of the turnaround strategy to restore value over time.  \n- Overall, the company faces significant operational, profitability, and financial risks, but proactive management actions and improving sales trends provide a cautiously optimistic outlook for gradual recovery."

This is reflected in the financial results contained in this report. As Chairman, my primary duty is to shareholders, and I believe the best way to deliver shareholder value is to regain our absolute focus on customers and on improving the shopping trip. A key priority for me will be to ensure that the governance of the business is as it should be. Our shareholders expect their company to be run in a responsible, sustainable and transparent manner. On behalf of the Board, I would like to express sincere regret for the impact of the commercial income issue on this company, and would like to assure you that we have moved swiftly and decisively to address this serious matter. An explanation of this issue is set out on page 33. With my colleagues on the Board, I am determined that T esco will be known for the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical leadership. I would like to thank my predecessor Sir Richard Broadbent, who has been resolute in addressing the numerous challenges and handled the scrutiny which the company has been under with great dignity. I would also like to thank P atrick Cescau, Jacqueline T ammenoms Bakker, Liv Garfield and Gareth Bullock who have recently retired as Non-executive Directors and also Ken Hanna and Stuart Chambers who have decided not to seek re-election to the Board at the AGM. I'm delighted to welcome Richard Cousins, Mikael Olsson and Byron Grote to the Board. T esco is lucky to have an outstanding new management team led by our CEO, Dave Lewis, and our CFO, Alan Stewart. They are supported by a first-class team of people who have begun the hard work of putting this great business back on its feet. As I have visited stores and other sites I have been struck by the commitment, enthusiasm and capability of T esco' s people. I am very confident that with their support T esco will be successful in refocusing on customers, rebuilding trust and over time delivering progressively better returns. The challenges T esco faces remain significant and fixing them will take time. However, I firmly believe we have the right team and the right strategy to deliver the longer-term performance our shareholders expect and deserve. John Allan Chairman Visit www. com ar2015 to hear more from John Allan on his first months at Tesco John Allan Chairman First impressions 2 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 It was a huge honour for me to be asked to lead T esco. It' s a business I had worked with for 27 years. As a supplier, I always had enormous admiration for T esco - its people, passion, and expertise. So when I was invited to come in and lead this great organisation, it was an opportunity not to be missed. I arrived at a time of significant challenge. Clearly, for a number of years, the global retail market has been highly competitive. W e were losing market share in our critical home market and the growth momentum we had enjoyed internationally had faltered. The channel shift to online and convenience presented both challenge and opportunity, but the bottom line was that we had stopped growing. In addition, or perhaps as a result of this lack of growth, we had significant internal challenges. The commercial income issue identified in September was a significant blow and has resulted in a SFO regulatory inquiry. We have been cooperating fully with the inquiry and as we work on a programme of change across T esco, we must ensure this never happens again. Alongside these issues is a deeper challenge of trust. For customers to choose to shop with us, they have to place their trust in us - on price, quality, service and as a brand. But over a number of years, we'five seen a gradual erosion of that trust for a number of reasons. Earning that trust back is fundamentally important t o T esco. W e will do this not by any quick fix or short term initiative, but r ather by c ontinuous and lasting changes in what we do and how we behave. Despite the challenges, at no point during these first few months has my belief in the potential of T esco diminished. As I got to know the different parts of our business across Europe and Asia, I have found an energy and engagement by colleagues which is incredible - beyond anything I had expected. That passion to do the right thing f or cust omers and the expertise to mak e it happen still beats strongly within our business. I am extr aordinarily proud of the way that colleagues have responded t o the challenges we f ace. The business has started a long journey of renewal and change. In partic ular, the way c olleagues from across the business work ed so hard t o deliver a f antastic Christmas showed me the strength and depth of retailing expertise which exists within our business. The action we have taken so far has helped to reset the business and restore our customer focus. The reality is that it will require concerted action to get T esco back to where it should be. In this report we are publishing losses of PS6.4bn for 2014 15. These losses were largely the result of a series of one-off charges representing our past performance. They recognise a number of issues: the value of the property we own has fallen: the cost of dealing with our excess stock levels and restructuring costs, as well as the cost of the retail sites we are no longer developing. Our reduced trading profit of PS1.4bn reflects the challenges we have seen in the UK and in our overseas markets. While these results reflect the difficulties our business has faced over a number of years, we are also beginning to see early promising signs from the changes we have made. By focusing on the fundamentals of availability, service and targeted price reductions over the last six months, we have seen a steady increase in footfall, transactions and, most significantly, volumes. Our like-for-like sales volumes are now up for the first time in four years. Every day we are seeing our customers recognise this. P ut simply, more customers are now buying more things at T esco. Our task now is to build on this and nourish these small green shoots of recovery. We need to continue to listen to our customers and they will guide us. T esco became a great business by putting our customers at the heart of everything we do and we shall do that again. Customers today are hard pressed for both time and money. They want prices which are simple and stable, as well as low. Wherever they shop, they want great choice and outstanding service which makes their shopping easier. Above all they want help to make life a little simpler, every step of the way. With our reach, our f ootprint, our skills and capabilities, we are perf ectly plac ed to lead and off er this kind of servic e. When I look at our business, I see a sea of opportunity. What we need t o do now is unlock the potential which exists within T esc o - and to do that, we need t o do some k ey things differently. In October, we set out our three strategic priorities: 1. Regaining competitiveness in core UK business 2. Protecting and strengthening the balance sheet 3. Rebuilding trust and transparency Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive A fresh start Tesco has always been a champion for customers. The last few years have been challenging, but we are confident that if we get back to doing an unbeatable job for customers, our best days lie ahead. com ar2015 to hear more from Dave Lewis 3 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Over the last six months we have taken action to deliver on each of these priorities - sharpening our focus on availability, service and selectively on price: undertaking a significant programme of restructuring and financial discipline: and launching a programme of renewal to restore trust in every aspect of the brand. A key part of our early work has been to simplify our organisation in all our markets and to make sure that customers are the absolute focus of all parts of the Group. In many cases this has involved very difficult decisions. The consequence on our business and importantly on our colleagues has been significant. In the face of these changes they have been brilliant at all times, putting the needs of the customer and the business first, and I would like to thank them for that. Through these difficult changes we are confident that we give ourselves the chance to be great again. The changes we are making are significant and are likely to result in an increased level of volatility in our performance over the short term. We are still in an extremely challenging market and face tough trading conditions in the UK and overseas. The benefit of at least some of the changes we are making will only be seen over time. Crucially, however, the approach we are taking now is based on a clear commitment to reinvest any savings or outperformance in the shopping trip. The better our offer is for customers, the more customers will shop with us, and the stronger our business will be over the long term. As we continue the work of transforming T esco, my overriding message to the business is this: work as one team and keep it simple. T oo often in the past we have added in layers of complexity where simplicity was needed. The result is that we have sometimes lost focus on what our customers think and feel. A crucial part of that is about giving more power to colleagues - empowering them to do the right thing for customers. We firmly believe that if we give colleagues more power to choose the right actions, we'll do a better job for customers and achieve greater success for our business. And one of the reasons I believe this, are the stories I receive each day of colleagues going out of their way and doing exceptional things for our customers. A few months after I arrived at T esco, I was asked what had most surprised me since joining the business. My answer was how big its heart is. I have never met a business with so many colleagues doing so many things to help customers and communities on a daily basis. Whether it's raising millions for charity, taking hundreds of thousands of children on food education tours, or leading the charge against food poverty, the work colleagues do is simply awe-inspiring. This kindness and spirit is also in the DNA of T esco and I'd like us to show it just a little more. As we embark on this journey of renewal and change, we recognise the responsibility and opportunity that comes with the choices we make. Doing the right thing for customers in a way that supports communities and the environment will be crucial to our future success. T esco is a great British success story. We grew into a successful business by focusing on the customer and helping him and her with both the big and the little things. These are challenging times, and we must be prepared for further volatility in the coming months, but we are emerging stronger and we believe our destiny is in our own hands. If we keep focusing on our customers, and challenging ourselves to make every single customer experience better every day, we know we can succeed. Dave Lewis Group Chief Executive \" We firmly believe that if we give colleagues more power to choose the right actions, we'll do a better job for customers\" 4 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Our starting point is the market where we serve the most customers: the UK. The UK represents more than two-thirds of our sales. So if we regain our competitiveness and do a better job for customers in this market, it will have a dramatic impact on the performance of the Group. We have been focusing on four things for our customers: Service. Our business is based on great service, but we haven't got this right in recent years. T o help fix this, we have invested in 4,652 new colleagues in customer-facing roles. We have also asked everyone who works in our offices to spend time working in store. Over the last few years, we have significantly increased the number of products in our ranges. This has put extra pressure on our store colleagues - and it's also left many customers confused. So over the course of this year and into the next we have started to review our ranges across all categories to make them simpler. As part of this we'five already met with over 100 suppliers. Partly because of an increasing range, we did not leave enough space for the most popular products and important items have not been available at peak times. We have now given more space to the top 1,000 lines in each store, resulting in marked improvements in product availability at peak times during the day. Along with great service and availability, we want to make those products which are most important to our customers as affordable as we can. As an example of this, we focused on the 'Festive Five', the five vegetables people most want with their Christmas lunches. Since January, we have dropped prices on hundreds of branded products and essential own-brand products. We are also committed to simpler, lower and more stable prices wherever we can. As a result of these changes, our customers are responding. Although we have work still to do, since October we have improved our competitiveness and every day more people are choosing to shop at T esco. In addition, we have identified cost savings across the Group of PS400m. We have also taken a difficult decision to close 43 unprofitable stores in the UK, and not to proceed with plans for 49 new stores. These decisions have been difficult but have been made to put the needs of the business and customers first. regain 5 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report protect We need to protect and strengthen our financial position so that we can maintain the flexibility to invest in a better shopping trip for customers. As a business we have too much debt with total leverage of PS 22 bn. We need to reduce that, both to deliver value for our shareholders, but also to free up money to invest in the shopping trip. In October we began an end-to-end review of all costs in the business. This has led to a number of significant decisions, including the decision not to pay a final dividend for 2014 15. Other key areas of focus include: Capital spending. We are committed to stronger financial discipline around capital spending. This year, we will be reducing capital expenditure to PS1bn. We have started a consultation to replace our defined benefit pension scheme for all colleagues. We are committed to protecting the pensions that colleagues have earned, and also to continuing to provide a competitive pension scheme for all colleagues. We have undertaken a detailed review of our property portfolio, including the leases which drive our PS1.5bn annual rent bill. As an example of this, we have completed an asset swap with British Land to regain sole ownership of 21 superstores, increasing the proportion of owned stores within our estate. As part of our review of the portfolio, all three Blinkbox businesses movies, music and books and T esco Broadband have been sold or closed. We have also appointed advisors to consider our options for dunnhumby. Alongside these structural changes is a cultural shift. Every pound we spend needs to be considered from the point of view of our customers. We want every spending decision to be weighed up against how many hours of store service the same investment would provide. 6 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Our third priority is to rebuild trust and transparency. We rely on the trust customers, suppliers, communities and shareholders place in us. Regrettably, this trust has been undermined, following the commercial income issue identified in September. What happened is a matter of profound regret for everyone at T esco. We have acted swiftly and decisively to ensure that it can never happen again. Across the business, we have brought in a wide ranging programme of change and renewal, which includes: New management who are transforming our commercial model to create long-term, mutually beneficial partnerships, with a greater focus on cost prices than on the commercial income we receive back from suppliers for promoting their products. A new Code of Business Conduct, supported by a company-wide training programme to help colleagues follow key policies. A speak-up culture, with a stronger focus on ethics and compliance. Code compliance and ethical leadership are now key factors in performance management and reward. In addition, we now have protector lines for both colleagues and suppliers, so any concerns with business conduct can be raised confidentially. Restoring trust is not just about process and structure. It' s about culture and individual actions. In the same way that every colleague holds the key to better customer service, so every colleague can help us to be a better active corporate citizen. We recognise the impact we can have on the lives of many - not just through our global reach but also in the way we run our business. For our customers, communities and the environment, we want our actions to make a big difference for everyone - and we are restless to build on the foundations we have in place. Key highlights this year include: Helping on health. In 1994 we were the first supermarket to take sweets off checkouts in our big stores. This year we became the first to do it in every UK store, including Express. We also announced our partnership with Diabetes UK and the British Heart Foundation to help tackle these diseases. It builds on our partnership with Diabetes UK which started in 2013 and raised over PS18m. Helping to tackle food poverty. Over the last three years we have pioneered a national programme of food collections working with FareShare and the T russell T rust. T ogether with customers we'five now provided over 21.5m meals for those in need. rebuild 7 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Our business model T esco grew into a big business by focusing on the little things. Not because we developed a highly complex business strategy. Nor because we developed a radical, revolutionary business model. We were successful because customers were our number one priority and everything we did was about doing the right thing for them. Our aim today is to regain that total focus on serving customers. We have refocused our business under three operational headlines: listening to, understanding and reaching out to customers to create the best possible offer working with growers and suppliers to make great products, and helping to deliver the best value to customers and working across different channels to get those products to customers in the most convenient way possible. Our aim is to make sure everything in the business is set up in the most efficient way to create value for customers. By refocusing on these three areas - and with the capabilities, reach, insight and skills we have within our business - we are uniquely placed to deliver the best offer we can and in doing so earn our customers' loyalty. By creating value for our customers, we will create sustainable value for our shareholders too. 8 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Reinvest Our clear priority is to improve Tesco for customers. As we do this, we have committed to reinvest any savings or outperformance into further improvements in our shopping trip. The reason for this reinvestment is clear: the better job we do for customers, the more we will improve our sales, and the more our sales improve, the more we can invest further in the shopping trip. Customers Tesco exists to serve customers - and our business model has customers as our number one priority. Our scale and reach mean we have the expertise to really understand our customers: allowing us to focus on the delivery of an offer with real value in all areas of price, quality, range and service. This focus means that we will champion our customers at every level and earn their loyalty. Channels To bring the best products to customers easily, we work through a range of channels - from small shops to large shops, and through our growing online business. We were the first retailer to offer 24-hour shopping and today we have thousands of Click & Collect points across the country. As part of improving our offer, we will invest in making our channels even more efficient and convenient for our customers. Product The offer we create for customers is developed by our Product team. They work with our suppliers to source the best possible range of quality products which meet and anticipate our customers' needs. Our relationships with suppliers are crucial to delivering our customer offer. Since October, we have been reviewing our partnerships to make sure we focus on delivering the best possible value to customers. 9 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report 70% work 58% 77 % shop Key performance indicators Our business has always been at its best when we'five made customers our number one priority. Colleagues want us to make it easier to put customers first. A key part of that is the way we measure performance and reward success. For a long time, we measured our performance using the Steering Wheel. This served us well for many years, but as time has gone on, it has become too complex, with over 40 different measures. We now have just six simple, key business performance measures. It's about alignment and focus: if we give our colleagues more power to choose the right actions, we'll do a better job for customers and achieve greater success for our business. The best result we can ever achieve is that our customers are so pleased with their experience at T esco that they recommend us to friends and shop with us again and again. We define loyal customers based on their frequency of shopping with us and average weekly spend. Over the past year, we have seen a 2.5 % decline in this measure. Going forward, this measure will provide a clear indication of our progress in regaining competitiveness. Customers recommend us and come back time and again 2. Colleagues recommend us as a great place to work and shop 3. We build trusted partnerships For customers to recommend us, we need to start with our colleagues and make sure T esco is a great place to work. In our latest survey, 70% of colleagues told us they would recommend T esco as a great place to work, and 77% said they would recommend us as a great place to shop. As part of our business transformation plan, we are committed to being more open, transparent and responsive to what really matters to colleagues. We are already making important changes, including new weekly calls between all store managers and senior leadership teams. Our business is built on strong partnerships. At a national level, we need to build trusted partnerships with suppliers to provide the best offer for customers. We also rely at a local level on partnerships with communities and wider society as part of our licence to operate. We survey our suppliers to capture how they feel about their relationship with T esco and the latest figures indicate that 58% feel satisfied. We have already started to make significant changes to the way we work with suppliers as part of our goal of restoring trust and transparency. 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 4. Improve operating cash flow If we do a better job for our customers, we will grow sales and achieve a stronger financial position. Last year, our Group sales declined by 1.4 %, reflecting a challenging backdrop and our own underperformance in the UK. While we must be prepared for further volatility, our focus will remain on our customers and we're working hard to have a positive impact on their shopping trip. As customers recommend us and keep returning to shop with us, our profitability will improve and we will achieve a stronger financial position. Group trading profit declined to PS1.4bn in 2014 15, driven by a challenging year for the UK business. We have taken action to start to restore our competitiveness and have committed to reinvest any savings back into the shopping trip to help our business be stronger over the long term. We need a strong cash flow so we can keep the business running and invest in our customers and the shopping trip. In 2014 15, our retail cash flow declined to PS1.9bn, reflecting both an extremely challenging year for T esco and a year in which we began a process of considerable change. Excluding VAT, fuel and IFRIC 13. Sales including fuel and VAT Sales excluding fuel and VAT 11 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report Financial review Alan Stewart Chief Financial Officer Visit www. com ar2015 to find PDF and Excel downloads of our financial statements The reported year has been both an extremely challenging year for Tesco and a year in which we began a process of considerable change. Against this backdrop we delivered sales of PS70bn in 2014 15, 1.3 % below last year on a 52 week basis at constant currency. Trading profit declined by 58.1 % to PS1.4bn principally as a result of a fall in like-for-like sales, the accumulated costs of inefficiencies within our operations and the changes we have made in the second half to stabilise the business. Our statutory loss before tax was PS 6.4 bn, after charging one-off items of PS 7.0 bn. Of these one-off items, PS 0.6 bn will result in a direct cash outflow, with the remaining amounts being non-cash adjustments to balance sheet carrying values. Protecting and strengthening our balance sheet Upon our arrival as a new management team we identified protecting and strengthening the balance sheet as one of our three priorities. This resulted in a number of steps to begin to address our balance sheet leverage of PS 21.7 bn, which we define more broadly to include net debt, discounted rent or lease commitments and our IAS 19 net pension liability: Liquidity and funding: We have underpinned our liquidity and funding position with access to PS5bn of credit facilities, which remained undrawn at the year end. These facilities are secure, multi-year credit lines ensuring we have the flexibility to address our three immediate priorities over an appropriate timeframe. Capital expenditure: In 2014 1 5 we reduced our capital expenditure from PS2.7bn to PS2.0bn. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the Group's requirements we expect to further reduce our capital expenditure to PS1.0bn in 201 5 16, net of disposals, without adversely affecting our business. Dividends: Following the reduction in the interim dividend, the Board has recommended not to pay a final dividend. Pension: A plan to fund the deficit has been agreed with the T rustee with a payment of PS270m per annum and we are consulting with our colleagues to replace our defined benefit pension scheme with a defined contribution scheme. Property: We have undertaken a detailed review of our property portfolio, including where appropriate to review our lease commitments. In addition we have taken the difficult decision to close 43 unprofitable stores and not to proceed with 49 new store developments. In March 201 5 we also announced an asset swap with British Land, regaining sole ownership of 21 superstores and reducing our exposure to indexed rent reviews. Portfolio: In October we said that we would review our portfolio. T o date, this process has resulted in the sale or the closure of Blinkbox and T esco Broadband and the appointment of advisors to review our options for dunnhumby. In 2015 16, we will retain our focus on financial discipline. Enhanced disclosure Restoring trust and transparency is also one of our three priorities and part of this objective will be met by progressively enhancing our disclosure. In this review we provide greater clarity around commercial income and the valuation and ownership of our property. The Notes to the accounts also include enhanced disclosure of segmental assets in Note 2 on page 94, net debt in Note 30 on page 1 35, JVs and associates in Note 1 3 on page 1 10 and operating leases in Note 34 on page 1 37. Importantly, for 201 5 1 6 we will also move to a simpler profit measure based on operating profit adjusted only for large and distorting impacts.

Following the year end we completed the closure of 43 stores which we expect to impact our 2015 16 sales by around 0.4 %. Like-for-like sales, including VAT and excluding fuel, fell by 3.6 %. This reflected a challenging and deflationary market back drop - and our own underperformance. We'five seen some improvement recently with fourth quarter like-for-like sales performance of 1.0 % driven by positive volumes which represents an encouraging response to the customer-focused initiatives launched in the third quarter.

The decline principally reflected the combination of the deterioration in like-for-like sales and the impact of previous initiatives. The fundamental change to the way we do business with our suppliers, with significantly less focus on commercial income, further impacted profitability. The investment we have made in service, availability and, selectively in price in the second half is also a contributing factor.

Our trading performance in Malaysia has been impacted by protests against some Western-owned businesses and a challenging economic environment. Our trading profit in Asia was 15.3 % lower year-on-year at constant rates, primarily due to the operational gearing effect from the impact of negative like-for-like sales performances in all three markets.

Sales in Europe reduced by 8.5 % on a 52 week basis including a 7.9 % foreign exchange effect as the Euro fell to seven-year lows against Sterling by year-end. Whilst we saw some improvement in the fourth quarter, the like-for-like sales performance was mixed over the course of the year. We have seen strong competition from discount retailers and this held back our sales performance, particularly in Ireland which saw a like-for-like sales decline of 6.3 %. The profitability of our Central European businesses continued to be under pressure and in Turkey included a PS 30 m charge relating to the write-off of a fuel debtor. Recent legislative changes in Hungary, including mandated store closures on Sundays and the introduction of a 'food supervision fee' from 1 January 2015, will have a material impact to ongoing market profitability. Consultation started in March 2015 on a significant restructure of the leadership team for Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia to move from operating as individual country teams to one regional team. This restructuring will create substantial buying and operational synergies, helping us to unlock more opportunities to invest in the customer offer.

We have expanded our range of mortgage and loan products and, in June 2014, we launched our personal current account. Our motor and home insurance business has seen 3% growth in accounts having expanded our underwriting providers and implemented digital improvements to enhance the customer experience. Trading profit was PS194m, in line with the prior year, with strong underlying growth offset by our ongoing investment in personal current accounts.

During the year the Group incurred PS 7. 0 bn of one-off and restructuring charges, largely reflecting the weak industry environment and the initiation of a number of measures to turnaround the performance of the Group. Of this amount, PS 0.6 bn will result in a direct cash outflow, with the remaining amounts being non-cash adjustments to balance sheet carrying values. These charges included: Fixed asset impairment and onerous lease charges: At each balance sheet date we review the carrying value of our stores to ensure that they are supported by their value in use or their fair value less the costs of disposal. Against the backdrop of challenging industry conditions and the decline in our profit, our review resulted in an impairment and onerous lease charge of PS 3.8 bn against our trading stores. A further impairment charge of PS 925 m is recognised in property related items, relating to the impairment of work-inprogress balances and charges relating to the closure of stores. Goodwill and other impairments: We have booked further goodwill and other impairments totalling PS 878 m. These include an impairment of PS 630 m relating to our investment with China Resources Enterprise Ltd CRE, PS 116 m relating to Dobbies and other UK businesses, and an impairment of PS 82 m in our investment in joint ventures which principally relates to the strategic decision to slow the roll out of Harris Hoole and Euphorium sites. Stock: The one-off items include a PS 570 m charge to the Group inventory position, principally due to the adoption of a forward-looking provisioning methodology. The charge also includes a PS 168 m impact of a reduction in the level of in-store costs capitalised to inventories. Restructuring: We have described a restructuring of central overheads, a simplification of store management structures and increased working-hour flexibility, which will deliver ongoing savings in the region of PS400m per year. These efficiencies will result in a one-off cost of PS 350 m of which around PS 300 m has been recognised in our 2014 15 results. The remaining balance includes a further PS 41 m relating to restructuring in the first half and a PS 20 m one-off cost relating to UK store closures. Commercial income adjustment: The commercial income adjustment refers to the impact on prior years of the commercial income issues that we announced last September. At the time of the interim results, the impacts on prior years were estimated as resulting in the profit before tax for the year ended 22 February 2014 being overstated by PS70m, and for the years prior to this being overstated by PS75m - a combined total of PS145m relating to prior years. Subsequent to October 2014, we continued to focus on this area and identified some further amounts, bringing the total one-off adjustment to PS208m for our UK and Irish businesses. 14 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Joint ventures, interest and tax Joint ventures and associates Losses from joint ventures and associates were PS 13 m, down from a profit of PS60m last year. The movement was primarily driven by a loss from our partnership with China Resources Enterprise Ltd CRE which was formed in May 2014. UK property joint ventures also made lower profits. Net finance costs TY LY Interest receivable and similar income PS90m PS132m Interest payable on short term bank loans and overdrafts PS 101 m PS 68 m Finance charges payable under finance leases PS 9 m PS 10 m Interest payable on medium term notes and bonds PS 433 m PS 448 m Capitalised interest PS44m PS79m Underlying net finance costs PS 409 m PS 315 m IAS 32 and IAS 39 effect PS 26 m PS 11 m Non cash element of IAS 19 Pensions charge PS 136 m PS 106 m Net finance costs PS 571 m PS 432 m Underlying net finance costs increased to PS 409 m from PS 315 m last year. The increase in net finance costs reflected a higher level of debt and the set up costs relating to new credit facilities. Finance income reduced primarily reflecting the redemption of a medium term note and the expiry of the associated hedging instrument resulting in lower derivative income. Capitalised interest reduced by PS 35 m to PS44m, in line with reduced levels of work-in-progress. Taxation The effective rate of tax for the Group was 20.7%, with a charge of PS 199 m based on underlying profit. Last year's rate of 15.4% reflected the one-off effect of a lower UK corporate tax rate on deferred tax liabilities. Earnings per share Underlying diluted earnings per share were 9.42p, 70.6 % lower year-on-year at actual tax rates 70.5 % lower on a 52 week basis, driven by the decline in our trading profit performance. Statutory losses per share were 70.24 p reflecting one-off items. Dividend As announced in January, the Board has taken the decision not to recommend a final dividend, with the full year dividend charge solely reflecting the interim dividend of 1.16p paid on 19 December 2014. Future dividends will be considered within the context of the performance of the Group, free cash flow generation and the level of indebtedness.

We continue to grow our franchise store network. ft. of space in our franchise stores, mostly in South Korea, and are planning to open a further 0.6m sq. Property As at the year end, the estimated market value of fully-owned property across the Group was PS22.9bn. This represents a reduction of PS7.6bn year-on-year driven mainly by the weakening of the UK and Central European property markets. This represents an estimated surplus of PS2.7bn over the net book value. The estimated market value excludes our share of property joint ventures. Including this, the valuation would increase by PS0.9bn, net of the debt in the joint ventures. Last year's disclosed property valuation of PS34.1bn included PS1.2bn relating to our Chinese operations now disposed to our joint venture and PS2.4bn from our share of joint venture property, before deducting debt. In March 2015, the British Land asset swap added a further PS0.7bn to the value of our property as we took ownership of 21 superstores. Including this increase, our Group freehold ownership percentage is now 55% by value and 60% by selling space.

Reflecting the lower level of underlying profitability, PS 0.6 bn in interest paid due to underlying finance costs and the timing of interest payments, and PS 0.3 bn of cash corporation taxes, net cash generated from retail operating activities was PS0.9bn. After cash capital expenditure of PS 2.2 bn this resulted in a free cash outflow in the year of PS 1.3 bn. This, combined with other movements led to a net debt movement of PS 1.9 bn. Pension On an accounting basis, the Group's net pension deficit after tax increased from PS 2.6 bn last year to PS 3.9 bn at the year end. This was driven by a reduction of 80 basis points in real corporate bond yields, leading to a corresponding reduction in the discount rate used to measure our long term liabilities, partially offset by a strong asset performance. On an actuarial basis, the deficit at 31 March 2014 was PS 2.8 bn and a plan to fund the deficit with cash contributions of PS270m per annum has been agreed with the Trustee. We are consulting with our colleagues to replace our defined benefit pension scheme with a defined contribution scheme. Total indebtedness We define our balance sheet leverage more broadly to include net debt, discounted rent and lease commitments and our IAS 19 pension liability. On this basis our total leverage or indebtedness was PS 21.7 bn, an increase of PS 3.1 bn driven by increases in both net debt and our pension liability. TY PSm LY PSm Net debt excludes Tesco Bank 8,481 6,597 Discounted operating lease commitments 9,353 9,419 Pension deficit, IAS 19 basis post-tax 3,885 2,559 Total indebtedness including lease commitments and pension deficit 21,719 18,575 Includes both continuing and discontinued operations. Our discounted minimum operating lease commitments were broadly unchanged at PS 9.4 bn, whilst our operating lease expense in the year increased by PS72m to PS1,486m. Around PS35m of this expense related to inflation-indexed rent which will not recur as a result of the British Land asset swap entered into post year end. The transaction will also result in the consolidation of net debt of around PS450m. Outlook The market is still challenging and we don't expect this to change in the immediate future. Over the next 12 months we will continue to focus on our three priorities: regaining competitiveness in our UK business: protecting and strengthening the balance sheet: and rebuilding trust and transparency in the business and the brand. We are already making good progress on these initiatives and on the basis of actions already undertaken they will deliver significant cost savings in 2015 16. The immediate priority for these and any other savings delivered is reinvestment in the customer offer in order to further restore UK competitiveness. Alan Stewart Chief Financial Officer 16 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Commercial income Commercial income represents part of our overall economic relationship with suppliers. Consistent with standard grocery market practice, we negotiate a very wide range of payments to and from our suppliers including fees, contributions, discounts, multiple offers and volume rebates. Whilst we have embarked on a fundamental review which will significantly simplify our approach, in total we currently use over 20 different categories of variation in payment terms. Many of these relate to adjustments to a cost price and can be considered and are in practice a part of the standard unit price variations that can be expected under normal, competitive market conditions. As such these amounts are recognised in the income statement as a deduction to the cost of goods sold. A number of commercial income categories can be conditional on the satisfaction of certain actions or performance conditions by either Tesco or the supplier in question, including the achievement of agreed sales volume targets, the provision of certain benefits such as marketing materials or promotional product positioning, and costs incurred for unplanned variations in product specification. In most instances, the arrangements that set out these terms cover periods that are within or end at the same point as our financial year. Where agreements are in place across a period end, judgement can be required to assess if the conditions will be met, and therefore to estimate the period end amounts payable and receivable. For example, where there are volume-related allowances spanning different account periods, the Group assesses the probability that targeted volumes will be achieved based on historical and forecast performance, recognising the appropriate amounts in the period end balance sheet and income statement. Commercial income is reflected in a number of balance sheet categories - principally due to differences in timing between recognition of income, receipt of cash and sale of goods. In order to provide greater clarity on the accounting for commercial income - including those instances where judgement and estimates are used - we are increasing our disclosure to show the effects of commercial income on the following balance sheet accounts: Inventories: The carrying value of inventories is reduced by the value of commercial income which will be earned when the associated stock is sold. Trade and other receivables: Amounts that have been invoiced to suppliers but not yet received are included within trade and other receivables. Accrued income: Any amounts earned but not yet invoiced to suppliers are included in accrued income. The majority relates to amounts outstanding under large supplier agreements or promotional allowances that run up to the period end. The balance primarily reflects amounts due under long-term agreements for volume rebates. Trade payables: Most agreements with suppliers enable income earned to be offset against amounts owed. These balances are included as a deduction within trade payables. Accruals and deferred income: Any amounts received in advance of income being earned are included in accruals and deferred income. The impact of commercial income on each of these accounts for the years to 28 February 2015 and 22 February 2014 is shown below: 2015 Group PSm UK PSm 2014 Group PSm UK PSm Current Assets Inventories 93 67 82 52 Trade and other receivablesOther receivables 97 54 89 22 -Accrued income 158 117 230 173 Current Liabilities Trade and other payablesTrade payables 347 173 547 368 -Accruals and deferred income 53 53 - - 17 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Other information Governance Financial statements Strategic report We have an established risk management process to identify the principal risks that we face as a business. The risk management process relies on our judgement of the risk likelihood and impact and also developing and monitoring appropriate controls. We maintain a Group Key Risk Register of the principal risks faced by the Group and this is an important component of our governance framework and how we manage our business. Our risk management process is cascaded down the Group. The content of the Group Key Risk Register is considered and discussed through regular meetings with senior management and review by the Executive Committee and the Board. Our process for identifying and managing risk is set out in more detail on page 44 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015. The table below sets out our key risks, their movement during the year and examples of relevant controls and mitigating factors. The Board considers these to be the most significant risks faced by our Group that may impact the achievement of our three strategic priorities as set out on page 3. They do not comprise all of the risks associated with our business and are not set out in priority order. Additional risks not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse effect on the business.

This is now the subject of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and civil proceedings in the United States. Details can be found on page 33 and in Note 32 on page 136 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015. There are significant uncertainties as to the outcome of the existing investigation and proceedings, as to whether further proceedings may be brought against the Group in connection with the overstatement of the expected financial results and as to whether any proceedings brought against the Group would be likely to have a significant effect on the results of its operations or its financial condition. 22 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Principal risks Risk movement Key controls and mitigating factors Data security and privacy Increasing risks of cyber-attack threaten the security of customer, colleague and supplier data We must ensure that we understand the types of data that we hold and secure it adequately to manage the risk of data breaches We have active monitoring processes to identify and deal with IT security incidents A new Cyber Security team has been established to investigate and mitigate the risks of cyber-attack A Group-wide Information Security Blueprint has been rolled out across our businesses There is a programme of compliance monitoring and review being rolled out with training across our businesses A programme to review the use, storage and security of customer data is in progress Transformation If the scale of the change across our business disrupts our focus, there is a risk that we will not transform the business to where it needs to be There is a risk that we underestimate the wider impacts of the changes that we are making NEW There is Executive sponsorship of the T ransformation programme with the creation of a T ransformation Director role New Group structures have been designed to simplify our business and clarify accountability A new Programme Management Office has been established to manage the T ransformation programme and will be supported by experienced resource from within the business and externally as required Competition and markets If we fail to address the differing challenges of the budget retailers, the premium retailers and online entrants, it may adversely impact our market share and profitability We actively seek to be competitive on price, range and service as well as developing our online and multiple formats to allow us to compete in different markets Our Executive Committee and operational units regularly review markets, trading opportunities and competitor strategy and activity Performance If our strategy is not effectively communicated or implemented, our business may underperform against plan and competitors The delivery of long term plans may be impacted if the business focuses on short term targets only Our Board, Executive Committee and operational units meet regularly to review performance risks All businesses have targets based on a new balanced scorecard of performance against KPIs and financial targets.

Further explanation of these risks is set out in Note 22 on page 120 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015. An overview of the management of these risks is set out below. Details of the main financial risks relating to T esco Bank and the management of those risks can be found in Note 22 on page 123 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015. Financial risks Key controls and mitigating factors Funding and liquidity risk The risk of being unable to continue to fund our operations on an ongoing basis The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, disposals of assets, debt capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases New funding of PS2.3 billion was raised during the year, including PS2.1 billion from long term debt and PS0.2 billion from property disposals. At the year end, net debt was PS8.5 billion 2014: PS6.6 billion The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities and to maintain access to capital markets so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due T esco has put in place PS5 billion of committed facilities consisting of a revolving credit facility and bilateral lines as alternate sources of liquidity At the year end, the Group had a long-term credit rating of BBBnegative from Fitch, Ba1 stable from Moody's and BB stable from Standard & Poor's Interest rate risk The risk to our profit and loss account resulting from rising interest rates Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and floors may be used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt Our policy is to fix interest rates for the year on a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs of the Group excluding T esco Bank. At the year end, the percentage of interest-bearing debt at fixed rates was 79% 2014: 84%. The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate form. The average rate of interest paid on an historic cost basis this year, excluding joint ventures and associates, was 4.09% 2014: 4.5% Foreign exchange risk The risk that exchange rate volatility may have an adverse impact on our balance sheet or profit and loss account Transactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are managed, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies and purchased currency options. At the year end, forward foreign currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to PS2.2 billion were outstanding 2014: PS2.9 billion as detailed in Note 21 on page 116 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015. We translate overseas profits at average foreign exchange rates We only hedge a proportion of the investment in our international subsidiaries as well as ensuring that each subsidiary is appropriately hedged in respect of its non-functional currency assets. During the year, currency movements increased the net value, after the effects of hedging, of the Group's overseas assets by PS5 million last year decrease of PS1,102 million Counterparty risk The risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions The Group holds positions with an approved list of highly rated counterparties T esco monitors the exposure, credit rating, outlook and credit default swap levels of these counterparties on a regular basis Insurance risk The risk of being inadequately protected from liabilities arising from unforeseen events We purchased assets, earnings and combined liability protection from the open insurance market for higher value losses only The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the business with some cover being provided by our captive insurance companies, ELH Insurance Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the Republic of Ireland. ELH Insurance Limited covers Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability, while Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability only This Strategic report, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, has been approved and signed on behalf of the Board.

It has been a year of addressing longstanding business issues: bedding in management and governance change: and laying the foundations for sustainable future growth. In all these areas I believe the Company has responded with energy, skill and application and we have made progress. Business issues One of the greatest challenges for a business is to face itself honestly. It is also the mark of a quality business that it can do so, since the capacity to name issues is the essential first step towards addressing them. The decisions to seek a sale of the US business and to call an end to the UK space race in large stores reflect this. As with the decision last year to reinvest in our UK business, they reflected a long, hard look at where the business needs to devote its energy and resources to create sustainable value: and a willingness to face up to tough decisions to do this. Some of these decisions had painful short-term consequences. The early signs are that the decision to reinvest in the UK is strengthening the business and we believe the steps we have taken in the US and in respect to UK property will similarly underpin a sustainable, profitable future, notwithstanding the accounting write-downs we have had to take this year as a consequence. Bedding in management and governance change The year has also seen a generational transition in management. This is not a surprise when there has been a relatively unchanged management team in place for a substantial time and we are fortunate in Tesco to have a substantial depth of talent to draw on from around the world. It is striking how many of the executives taking on new and enhanced responsibilities bring international as well as extensive UK experience to their roles, reflecting the breadth of Tesco's business. A largely new Executive Committee has been developed under Philip Clarke's leadership. Many talented, and widely experienced, younger executives are getting to grips with new responsibilities with skill and enthusiasm. Similarly in the UK business, a substantially new leadership team with a wide diversity of experience and skills is in place under a new Managing Director. \" It has been a year of addressing long-standing business issues: bedding in management and governance change: and laying the foundations for sustainable future growth. In all these areas I believe the Company has responded with energy, skill and application and we have made progress. \" Sir Richard Broadbent Chairman Visit www. com ar2013 to hear more from Sir Richard Broadbent and other members of the leadership team. 3 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Report from the Chief Executive I am pleased to have this opportunity to report on the past year, during which we have taken some significant business decisions and laid down some important building blocks for the future. I will share my perceptions of the year under the following headings: The wider context - adapting to lead the digital future The business in 2012 13 - a year of transition Setting financial disciplines for the future Driving future growth and returns Culture Management The wider context - adapting to lead the digital future It has been clear for some time that we are seeing a seismic shift in our industry and its pace is accelerating. In 2012 global e-commerce activity reached $1 trillion. I'five worked in retailing for nearly 40 years but never in that time has there been a period of such profound and rapid change as I see today. The digital age is transforming not just the way people shop, but also the way they live their lives. The opportunities this is creating are exciting. It provides the potential for Tesco to make customers' lives easier: to enable them to shop in whichever way suits them best: and it enables us to offer them new products and services. This plays to our strengths. Since Tesco was founded, we have always been pioneers and innovators in retailing. Our central focus, our culture, is and has been to lead in understanding and delivering what customers want, in the way they want it, at the time they want it. Uniquely among our peers, we have a profitable dotcom grocery business. From drivethrough Grocery Click & Collect in the UK to our virtual shopping walls on the subway in South Korea, we are introducing exciting innovations to improve the customer shopping trip. Thanks to Clubcard and dunnhumby we have unique insights into how our customers' behaviour is changing. Our new conversation with customers - through a variety of channels - is about listening to what they want, to how they're living their lives today, and then adapting and building the business accordingly: as we have said for years, 'Every Little Helps'. \" The digital age is transforming not just the way people shop, but also the way they live their lives. \" Philip Clarke Chief Executive Visit www. com ar2013 to hear more from Philip Clarke and other members of the leadership team. 4 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Report from the Chief Executive continued So we are exceptionally well-placed to thrive in this new era of retailing. However, to grasp the opportunity we must adapt because it will require a different type of business, with a different type of relationship with our customers, and a new set of capabilities. We have already begun this process of adaptation. A year ago, I signalled the end of the space race and a change in focus. I indicated that our future investment would be less about new large stores, and that it would be more focused on multichannel retailing and on smaller formats. A year on, I am even more certain that this is the right approach for us to take. The future of retailing is multichannel because, in this increasingly complex and volatile world, consumers are looking for simplicity and for brands they can trust. A truly multichannel business - one which offers customers the ability to shop anywhere, anyhow and any time - will be more likely to become a winner in the new era than one which concentrates purely on one channel or another. Our stores are a vital part of this multichannel vision. Tesco has a superb portfolio of welllocated stores in all of our markets, but adapting to a digital future means harnessing this great asset to the changing requirements of the digital age. This will require rethinking how we use the space in our stores, how we offer and deliver what we sell, how we interface with our customers and much else besides. I will return to the specifics of what we are doing in some of these areas below. The business in 2012 13 - a year of transition This year's performance was principally the result of three things in combination: the decision we took in early 2012 to reset our margin in the UK and invest PS1 billion in improving our offer for customers: the continuing economic challenges our customers around the world are facing, particularly in and around the Eurozone: and the impact of legislation restricting opening hours in South Korea, our largest market outside the UK. I have reflected on the work we have done over the first two years of my tenure as CEO and it is clear to me that much of our effort has been about removing barriers to progress. The business has delivered many years of growth and good returns, but was in danger of being inhibited from further sustainable progress by an attachment to initiatives and strategies which, while they served us well in the past, need to be adapted to deliver growth in a more economically challenged and rapidly changing world. Consequently we have had to tackle a number of issues which needed to be addressed before we could move the business forward. This work has entailed some tough and at times painful decisions and while it is not finished, I am confident we have already tackled the biggest issues. These changes were often difficult to face up to, complex to implement and they have required a great deal of hard work by many people, some of whom have been directly affected by the decisions. By way of reminder, in a little over 18 months we have: 1. Decided to exit markets in which we saw no prospect of acceptable investment returns in an appropriate time frame - Japan and the United States: 2. Devised and progressed the comprehensive PS1 billion investment plan to 'Build a Better Tesco' in the UK, resetting our margins to fund the scale and pace of change required: 3. Put an end to the big store space race - placing a much greater emphasis on growth through both digital and convenience retailing, wherever we operate: 4. Reviewed our entire UK property pipeline to ensure it is appropriate for our future needs and valued accordingly. Going forward this will mean less capital commitment to property development and also less asset divestment: 5. Reflected the new global economic reality by reviewing and moderating the rate of expansion in some large economies such as China and sharply reduced spending in some of our European markets: and 6. Focused Tesco Bank on the smooth migration of customer accounts to our platforms, strong governance, risk management and increasingly on preparing it for its key role in our multichannel future. \" A truly multichannel business - one which offers customers the ability to shop anywhere, anyhow and any time - will be more likely to become a winner in the new era than one which concentrates purely on one channel or another. \" 5 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS These decisive actions are necessary in order to ensure sustainable longer-term growth. I am acutely aware that withdrawing from the US and writing down the value of property developments no longer appropriate for the future have had a significant impact. It is time to act and I believe this work has cleared the way for the business now to move forward. Having tackled these issues, Tesco is a more focused business, which can apply all of its considerable resources and energies to meeting the challenges and grasping the opportunities created by the changes taking place in our industry today. These actions may have been the most visible, and therefore the most tangible, signs of change to the outside world but within Tesco we'five been making other important changes to prepare the business for the future - putting it on track for sustainable growth and returns. Setting financial disciplines for the future Not only have we started on the journey of transforming our business to enable it to move forward as a leader in the new digital world, we are also fundamentally changing the financial profile of the Group. The Tesco of the future will pursue more focused growth, consume less capital and generate more free cash flow. Making this transformation in all its aspects will of course not be without its challenges - and the clearest evidence of this can be seen in the first reduction in profits of the Group for two decades, which we reported on in April. Everything we are doing reflects my determination to deliver shareholder value, an appropriate balance between investing for future growth, and delivering sustainable returns for our shareholders. I want to be very clear: if there is one lesson to be learned from the past it is the importance of capital discipline and this marks the start of a new era of capital discipline in Tesco. We are confident we can deliver attractive and sustainable returns within a framework where capital expenditure falls to around 3.5% to 4% of sales. For our investors, this means they can expect mid-single digit trading profit growth and return on capital employed within a range of 12% to 15%. The fundamental change in our approach to new space I described earlier also has implications for our sale and leaseback programme. Two years ago, we reviewed the programme and announced a steady reduction in the level of divestments, in order to ensure that any property profits released were matched to the level of new profit created by development activities. Given that we have significantly reduced the amount of these activities going forward, we believe that it is appropriate to accelerate the scaling back of the sale and leaseback programme, such that it is unlikely to make a material contribution after the next few years. The outcomes which we have laid out for investors will be achieved through disciplined investment, focused on those existing markets where we see the best opportunity for significant growth and returns. Driving future growth and returns For me as your CEO, driving sustainable growth within this new financial framework is about three priorities. These are not new areas for us but they each have the capacity to be the engines of growth for the Group for years to come: i Continue to strengthen the UK business ii Drive sustainable growth through multichannel leadership iii Pursue disciplined international growth Whilst the past year has not been without some significant challenges, we have made progress on these priorities: \" Everything we are doing reflects my determination to deliver shareholder value, an appropriate balance between investing for future growth, and delivering sustainable returns for our shareholders. \" 6 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Report from the Chief Executive continued i Continue to strengthen the UK business A year ago we announced a plan to 'Build a Better Tesco' in the UK. In last year's Annual Report I described how getting our business at home back to leading was the single most important objective for Tesco. Having grasped the nettle and decided to reinvest in the UK business in early 2012, we have seen a pleasing response from customers - and consequently the performance of the business is now markedly better. The 'Building a Better Tesco' plan is firmly on track. I am proud of the work our teams have done to improve the look and feel of certain stores, to develop new products and to reformulate existing product ranges, whilst delivering better service and availability for customers. We want to be the best value, most convenient and integrated, most relevant and personalised retailer and we are making good progress. We invested PS200 million to have the equivalent of 8,000 more colleagues in-store and also provided customer service and specialist training for nearly 250,000 team members to help them serve customers better. Consequently, our customer ratings of service and staff helpfulness have improved and customer complaint numbers have fallen sharply. We have made a good start and there will be more progress in 2013. We refreshed 300 stores, representing almost a quarter of our space, delivering a warmer look and feel and better standards of presentation in our fresh food departments. Our price image with customers has also improved, and we have supplemented our work on pricing with stronger, personalised Clubcard mailings and, more recently, the introduction of our Tesco Price Promise, which aims to reassure customers that they will never be disadvantaged on price when they shop with us. On ranging, the strong performance of the relaunched Everyday Value range has continued and we have put significant investment into improving 3,500 core Tesco own-label lines, with an emphasis on fresh food categories. We have made fundamental changes to the way we communicate with our customers, with the most prominent early change being the appointment of a new lead advertising agency, Wieden Kennedy. Our first new advertising campaign, which began last Christmas, was very well received by customers. Our store strategy is 'Food First' which means a more targeted, less space-intensive approach to general merchandise in-store, with Tesco Direct becoming better equipped to offer customers the much greater breadth and depth of range that the online platform provides so well. It also means other changes to our stores - such as clothing becoming more prominent and services taking more space. This means, for example, allocating more space to Click & Collect so that we are giving customers the compelling convenience of being able to order what they want online and pick up in-store. Upgrading our in-store dining offer will also utilise more of our existing space. We aim to give customers shopping in our stores the kind of food experience they have when they visit shopping malls or high streets. We'll do this through the investments we have made in new family-friendly restaurants, coffee shops and artisan bakeries - such as Giraffe, Harris Hoole and Euphorium. They will be increasingly available around our network of larger stores in the UK. I'five been particularly encouraged to see that the innovative spirit, that desire to be first for customers which made Tesco what it is, has also flourished in this period of rapid change. A good example of this is in our dotcom grocery business where the roll-out of our drivethrough Click & Collect modules in 150 of our car parks helped our online sales grow 12.8% - which was faster than the market, in which we already have a high share. The launch of our Delivery Saver subscription service in May 2012 also contributed to our outperformance. \" Having grasped the nettle and decided to reinvest in the UK business in early 201 2, we have seen a pleasing response from customers - and consequently the performance of the business is now markedly better. \" 7 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our UK business is more competitive, performance relative to the market has improved and our margins have stabilised, as planned, and there is still much more to come. The scope for further improvement means that this objective remains our most important priority. I am pleased with the progress we'five made, but I am equally pleased that we have the opportunity and plans for that progress to continue. With the new UK management team now bedded in, in January this year I felt able to step back from the day-to-day running of the business, which I had assumed temporarily in March 2012. Chris Bush, who has over 30 years' experience in Tesco, has taken over the leadership as UK Managing Director. The strategic importance of Tesco Bank to the Group is being increased by the impact of the internet on the way our customers shop - and I believe it is a key part of our multichannel future. It will provide the means for more and more of our customers to transact online using Tesco financial products. Several years of infrastructure build and the wider challenges that the whole banking sector has had to deal with - from more careful management of risk to PPI claims - have held back performance. The Bank plays an important role in driving increased loyalty for Tesco and we are giving even more focus to delivering the best possible products and prices to our Clubcard customers. ii Drive sustainable growth through multichannel leadership I believe establishing multichannel leadership - combining digital and online seamlessly with our existing excellent physical store network - is going to be critical for our future success. We'five made good progress - we're the largest internet retailer of food in the UK and we're getting bigger and better in clothing and general merchandise - but the opportunities remain huge. The judgements we make today about how we respond to the new digital era will profoundly affect the kind of business Tesco becomes in the years ahead. The internet and social media are rapidly changing the way people live their lives: the way they shop and what they expect from us - not just in terms of goods and services, but also what we stand for and how we contribute to society. The speed of that change is accelerating and if we are to lead this revolution in our industry, I believe we must move faster and embrace it. Calling an end to the big store space race and beginning a move to refocus our investment away from large stores, particularly hypermarkets, to convenience and online has been followed by an accelerating pace of change over recent months in all our businesses and geographies. For example, we are increasing our investment in technology and PS500 million of our total capital spend will be devoted to technology, enabling us to create a seamless blend between our stores and online businesses. A good example of this change in emphasis is blinkbox. We are already one of the leading retailers of films, TV series, music and books in the UK. Given the rapid pace of change in the way customers are buying entertainment products, we have been working to develop a range of new digital services. In March 2013 we launched Clubcard TV using the blinkbox platform, a free service providing family-friendly films and television series to our most loyal customers. In the next few months, we will be launching blinkboxmusic and blinkboxbooks, demonstrating our commitment to providing the very best entertainment as easily as possible for our customers. Going forward, we will be applying this thinking and experience to our international markets around the world. \" Given the rapid pace of change in the way customers are buying entertainment products, we have been working to develop a range of new digital services. \" \" The strategic importance of Tesco Bank to the Group is being increased by the impact of the internet on the way our customers shop - and I believe it is a key part of our multichannel future. \" 8 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Report from the Chief Executive continued iii Pursue disciplined international growth The single most important step we took in 2012 13 in our international business was to launch a strategic review of Fresh & Easy in the United States and in April we confirmed our decision to exit the market. This was not a decision lightly reached but in keeping with what I have said about the need to move the business forward, and to do so in a disciplined way - the US business simply did not offer the prospect of acceptable returns in an appropriate time frame. Whilst the process of exit is ongoing, and as such the full financial effect of it is yet to be fully determined, we have written down the assets of the business and booked provisions for future liabilities - which together have impacted profit after tax by PS 1 billion. Fundamentally, we invest overseas because we have the opportunity to generate returns by using our skill and scale in high-growth economies, where retailing is less mature, to build substantial market positions and strong consumer franchises. This opportunity is unchanged and exploiting it remains an important element of our strategy. We have had success - 32% of our sales and 29% of our profit now comes from outside the UK, and we have market-leading businesses in eight of our 11 international markets. Over two decades of international development we have learned a huge amount about what works and what doesn't - getting the pace and scale of expansion right for local conditions, getting the balance right between local front-end, global skills in sourcing and logistics and being ready to partner where appropriate. Utilising this knowledge is critical to driving future returns from our international business. Looking forward, these lessons will guide our approach to internationalisation. We will stay focused for the foreseeable future on our existing markets, and on allocating significant capital only where we see very good prospects of strong investment returns. And where we do invest, it will be with a clear emphasis on lower capital intensity routes to growth such as convenience and online. I have categorised our countries into three groups to explain what this approach means in practice: In Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia, where we have strong market positions and economic growth remains more robust, our businesses have substantial further potential for growth. These markets continued to deliver excellent performance in 2012 13, although the headline growth was obscured by the c. PS 100 million profit impact of legislation to restrict large store shopping hours in South Korea. Looking forward, the opportunities to build on our already strong positions in these fast-growing economies remain compelling and are therefore our highest international priority. In the European markets where we have solid, in some cases, market-leading businesses, but where the economic backdrop has been damaging to performance, our emphasis will be on holding our position, driving further benefits of skill and scale and making targeted investment in specific opportunities, such as online and convenience retailing. At present, the economic context remains unfavourable with continued recession and austerity in all of our markets - the Republic of Ireland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Long term, these remain fundamentally attractive markets for Tesco both as growth markets and as markets where multichannel retailing is still in its infancy. In China, Turkey and India, which are exciting long-term growth opportunities, we will push on - but carefully - adopting a steadier pace of growth that is, importantly, more cautious about capital allocation. Our model in India is to work with the Tata Group, and we are unable to commit our own capital under current regulations. However, the model works, we like our partner and we are learning a lot about the market. We will commit new capital to China and Turkey, but only for those opportunities that pass our rigorous investment appraisal targets. We will be committing less capital in the coming years than we have done in the past - at least until we can demonstrate a significant step forward towards our objective of stronger returns. \" We will stay focused for the foreseeable future on our existing markets, and on allocating significant capital only where we see very good prospects of strong investment returns. \" 9 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Capitalising on the multichannel opportunity in all these markets will be a core part of our longterm planning. We are already moving much faster to roll out grocery home shopping - which is now in eight international markets and we plan to launch in China later this financial year. Culture For a consumer business above all, what you represent is critical and it is right that we should be responsive and open about our Values and what we stand for. We should actively manage them just as we manage other parts of our business. We have completed a thorough review, looking at whether our Core Purpose and Values are all that we need in this new world and at a time of change. We have concluded that we need to encourage some changes to ensure it is clear to everyone at Tesco and beyond that we will put more back into society than we take out. You will find a lot more about this over the page and in the Tesco and Society Report. Today, our brand must be about more than simply function. It's about the way we work, the values we live by, the legacy we leave. We can't solve the world's problems but we want Tesco to always do the right thing, to inspire and to earn trust and loyalty from all our stakeholders. And we are putting some clear ambition into changing things for the better in areas where we can make a difference because of who and what we are: First, we are going to focus our attention on young people wherever we are in the world. We are a major global employer, which means we understand how to provide opportunities for people in their working lives. So we want to use that to help millions of young people who are worried about their future and are uncertain how to get a foothold in the world of work. Second, we're going to help and encourage our colleagues and customers to live healthier lives and through this help to tackle the global obesity crisis. Third, we're going to lead on the challenge of reducing food waste globally. 'Waste not, want not' is at the heart of 'Every Little Helps'. So it is natural for us to want to take a leading role in preventing the enormous quantities of food going to waste every day around the world. I believe that by applying our skills and resources - our scale - to these areas, Tesco can make a difference and make things better. Management I am delighted to say that underpinning all of our drivers of growth - UK, multichannel and international - is the strength of the new management team we have created. Our new Executive Committee draws on the potential of the strongest, most experienced leaders within Tesco, complemented by some first-class external appointments in key disciplines. I am confident that the team we now have in place has the skills, experience, creativity and drive to deliver our ambitions. All of these changes are the result of my determination to ensure that Tesco is a company that delivers shareholder value - but one that does so by delivering what matters to all our stakeholders. Philip Clarke Chief Executive \" Today, our brand must be about more than simply function. It's about the way we work, the values we live by, the legacy we leave. \" 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Core Purpose and Values Our Core Purpose is a clear and simple statement of what we do and what we stand for: We make what matters better, together Our Core Purpose is a clear and simple statement of what we do and what we stand for. It has been the same for many years but the time has come to update it. Our Core Purpose needs to reflect how much society has changed in recent years - more scepticism about corporations, more desire to see business demonstrate it has a purpose beyond profit, a sense that large companies should be contributing more to tackling some of the big challenges. The world has changed from a culture of 'more is better' to 'making what matters better'. That's why we'five changed our Core Purpose - this profound shift in society must be reflected in the way we think and behave as a business. Today, our brand must be about more than simply function. It's about the way we work, the values we live by, the legacy we leave. We can't solve the world's problems but we want Tesco to always do the right thing, to inspire and to earn trust and loyalty from all of our stakeholders. 11 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our new Core Purpose is: We make what matters better, together. It is true to where we came from but more relevant to today and to the kind of company we want to be. Since we first introduced our Tesco Values more than a decade ago, they have become a vital part of our culture - and an essential underpinning of our growth and success. They ensure that every person at Tesco understands what is important - about how we work together as a team and how customers are at the centre of what we do. They are universal values, which have helped guide our people as Tesco has grown into new markets and new countries. And as with our Core Purpose, we have had a hard look at whether the Values are all that we need in this new world and at a time of change - and we'five concluded that we need a new Value, one that makes it clear to everyone at Tesco and beyond that we will put more back into society. Our new Value is: We use our scale for good. Tesco is now a large company, touching millions of people's lives every day. This scale gives us an opportunity to make a positive difference to some of the biggest challenges facing the world. We'five set three big ambitions in areas where we can make a real contribution and create value for society as a whole. Our new Value is also about building on the essential work we already do as a responsible corporate citizen. Our Values help us to understand how to put this into practice: 1 No one tries harder for customers 2 We treat everyone how we like to be treated 3 We use our scale for good Understand customers Be first to meet their needs Act responsibly for our communities Understanding people - customers, colleagues, communities - and what matters to them, and then trying to make those things better, is at the heart of Tesco. It's about listening to people and talking to them using all the tools at our disposal - from Clubcard data to social media - and then acting by changing and innovating to meet their needs. Work as a team Trust and respect each other Listen, support and say thank you Share knowledge and experience We know that looking after our colleagues in a culture of trust and respect is essential to the success of Tesco. Where colleagues feel recognised and rewarded for the work they do together, where they have the opportunity to get on and where they are supported in their development as they move through their careers in the business - they in turn try their hardest for customers. Creating new opportunities for millions of young people around the world Helping and encouraging our colleagues and customers to live healthier lives and through this helping to tackle the global obesity crisis Leading in reducing food waste globally Our scale means that we can provide affordable, high-quality food to people around the world and create value for customers. We want to use this scale to create greater value for society as a whole. In many ways we do this already, whether it's by creating thousands of jobs or working with thousands of farmers to provide world-class products. But now we want to scale up our efforts and make a positive contribution to some of the most pressing challenges facing the world. 12 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Vision and Strategy Our Vision sets out what we want to be: In any business, clear direction is vital. Our Vision guides the direction and the decisions we take as an organisation. Tesco is a company built around customers and colleagues, highquality assets around the world and multiple opportunities for growth - and these characteristics are central to our Vision for the business. We want Tesco to be the most highly valued business by: the customers we serve, the communities in which we operate, our loyal and committed colleagues and of course, our shareholders. For these things to be possible, our Vision for the business has five elements - each of them describes the sort of company Tesco aspires to be. Wanted and needed around the world We see it as essential not only to be the shop of choice for customers but also the place people want to work, a business that communities welcome and the retailer in which every shareholder wants to invest. A growing business, full of opportunities Whether it's food or general merchandise, books or digital entertainment, banking or eating out, our business is full of opportunities for both customers and colleagues. We want our business to offer something new every time. Modern, innovative and full of ideas Tesco's success has always been based on trying to understand customers' needs better than anyone else - and then innovating to make their lives that little bit easier. This attitude, which brought online grocery shopping, extended shopping hours, Finest, Everyday Value, a range of formats from Express to Extra - and all the other things that make us who we are - is as central to our Vision now as it ever has been. Winners locally whilst applying our skills globally Retail is local because cultures, tastes, climates, regulations are all different. But the core skills that we have learned in one place can be applied in others. For example, setting up our grocery home shopping operations from scratch in eight international markets across the Group wouldn't have been possible without what we'five learned in the UK. Inspiring, earning trust and loyalty from customers, our colleagues and communities We want Tesco to be a company that earns trust, not just respect, through everything we do - be it our in-store shopping trip, our Price Promise, or our determination to assure customers on food quality. We want to be a business that customers, colleagues and communities trust and are loyal to. 13 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our Strategy reflects our priorities as the business grows and customers' needs change: We have a well-established and consistent seven-part strategy for growth, which reflects the way consumer needs are changing and the increasingly global nature of our business - and of course driving it forward is critical to our success over the coming years. To grow the UK core T o grow the UK core, the largest business in the Group and a key driver of sales and profit, is a priority. Our 'Building a Better T esco' plan has been restoring growth to the business through a comprehensive series of improvements for customers. To be an outstanding international retailer in stores and online We have established profitable businesses in Asian and European markets. T oday, 32% of our Group sales and 29% of profits are made internationally and our goal now is to take the performance of these businesses to higher levels. To be as strong in everything we sell as we are in food Food is our heritage but as the business has grown and diversified over recent years, we have added an ever-wider range of products and services in-store and online, bringing T esco value and quality to many more categories. To grow retail services in all our markets Consumers are increasingly spending a bigger proportion of their income on services - whether it is in telecoms, eating out or financial services. In the UK, we have built some strong, successful new businesses and our ambition now is to take that experience to all of our markets. T o put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do The changes we have made to our Core Purpose and Values to reflect T esco's wider social purpose are clear signals that we put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do. To be a creator of highly valued brands Brands are about giving customers confidence in the quality, value and reliability of the things we sell. We aim to be a creator of highly valued brands across our offer, whether it is Finest, F&F or T esco Bank. To build our team so that we create more value As T esco continues to grow and diversify we need more leaders to run the broad range of businesses, operations and support functions. We are investing in the development of more leaders and a bigger, more diverse talent pool to support the growth of the Group. 14 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Building the T esco brand Leveraging Group Developing our people Creating valuable property Operating responsibly Innovating our offer Develop economies of scale Invest in our offer for customers Sell more skill and scale Insight Buy Sell Move Core Purpose: We make what matters better, together Business Model Our Business Model is how we put our Strategy into action: 15 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our core activities Like all retailers, we buy, move and sell products and services for our customers. They rely on us to do these things consistently well and we strive to do them better, more simply and more efficiently each time. We have convenient, well-invested store and distribution networks, with a skilled and experienced team and modern systems designed to help us do this reliably - as well as growing capability and scale online. This operational effectiveness is at the core of the Tesco business model. Winning loyalty is also about looking constantly at ways to do things differently and innovating for customers so that our offer doesn't stand still. Innovation comes from insight and insight starts with listening. We try to work out what matters to customers by talking to them - and the conversation goes on all the time, in all our businesses, in stores and online, whether it is through our regular customer question time sessions or social media feedback. Customers tell us what's important to them - when we're doing well and, even more importantly, when we're not. Coupling that feedback with the data we get from Clubcard and the analysis we apply from dunnhumby - and then acting on the result - is what Tesco is all about. The virtuous circle Striving for continuous improvement in operations and in the shopping trip, as well as staying close to customers, are fundamentals but the engine of the Tesco business model has always been a combination of scale and growth. This remains just as true today in an environment where growth across many markets is harder to come by. Tesco may only be as successful as a customer's last shopping trip but our scale and how we use it are very important to how we create value. Buying well and selling efficiently are essential in order to be competitive for customers. When we combine these really well, we deliver a great offer and customers reward us with more of their business. The more we sell, the more we are able to work with our suppliers to achieve mutually beneficial economies of scale, which in turn creates room to invest more for customers - in products, categories and businesses. This has served the business well over many decades - but in our business in the UK we stepped off the virtuous circle when the recession hit. We didn't put enough back in for customers at a time when they were under pressure - and our performance and reputation felt the effect. We recognised the need to change, and last year we chose to reduce and reset our own margin to fund substantial investment in improving the shopping trip for customers and to move the business towards stronger growth. The key enablers The core elements of the business model have six key enablers - including, for example, leveraging Group skill and scale and innovating our offer - which maximise the potential of the core activities and ensure that what we do is sustainable. Transferring know-how, new systems and processes around the Group has become a regular part of how we do things based on the principle of 'invent once, deploy everywhere'. As our leadership group - which numbers over 500 directors - gains even more experience in multiple markets, new technologies and approaches can be introduced quickly and cost-effectively. Loyalty and own-label programmes, format expertise and online trading platforms are all current examples of Tesco leveraging Group skill and scale. As keeping pace with changing consumer shopping patterns - what they buy, how, where and when they shop - becomes ever more demanding, staying close to our customers means that we are well-placed to see and to grasp the opportunities to innovate. For example, we spend a lot of time applying new technology in-store so that we can improve the shopping experience for customers. A good example is Scan as you Shop - now in 100 stores - which allows customers to scan products as they put them into the trolley, see how much they are spending as they go, and reduce their waiting time at the checkouts. 16 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Key performance indicators Group performance Growth in underlying profit before tax 14.5 % Return on capital employed 'ROCE' 12.7% Growth in underlying diluted earnings per share at a constant tax rate 14.0 % 09 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 8.7% 12.3% 2.1% 14.5 % Definition Our underlying profit provides information on the underlying trend and performance of the business. It is adjusted for a number of non-cash accounting adjustments and one-off costs. Performance Our year-on-year performance in underlying profit before tax reflects a number of factors - mainly our planned investment into the UK business, the regulatory changes in South Korea and the impact of challenging economic conditions in Europe. The 2011 12 figure including the US was 1.6%. 11 12 12 13 14.7% 12.7% 09 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 7.7% 10.8% 2.6% 14.0 % Definition Underlying diluted earnings per share 'EPS' is the amount of underlying profit, adjusted for the number of shares in issue. Performance The fall in underlying diluted EPS reflects the reduction of earnings this year. We have maintained the proposed full year dividend per share despite this, demonstrating our confidence that the steps we have taken in 2012 13 will set the Group on track to resume growth. The 2011 12 figure including the US was 2.1%. Definition ROCE is a relative profit measurement that demonstrates the return the business is generating from its gross assets.

Debt is adjusted net debt, calculated as net debt, the pension deficit and the net present value of lease obligations. Performance Net indebtedness has risen despite a reduction in net debt, due mainly to the decline in EBITDAR driven by our investment in the UK, the regulatory impact in South Korea and challenging economic conditions, particularly in Central Europe.

For example, five-year TSR for 2012 13 is the annualised growth in the share price from 2007 08 and dividends paid and reinvested in Tesco shares, as a percentage of the 2007 08 share price. Performance TSR increased this year, reflecting the effect on our share price of increased investor confidence since last year's decision to invest significantly in our customer offer in the UK. 09 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 54.0% 40.8% 38.4% 39.6% Definition The proportion of net assets financed through debt rather than equity, calculated as net debt divided by total equity.

Capital expenditure 'capex' as % of sales 4. 1% 0 2 4 6 8 12 13 10 11 08 09 06 07 04 05 02 03 % Definition Capex is the investment in property, plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets. This is divided by Group sales inc. VAT, inc. petrol to show a relative investment to sales. Performance This year we continued to reduce our rate of capital investment, focusing on less capital-intensive investments with higher returns, most notably online and convenience. This year our capex was PS3 billion or 4.1% of sales and fell year-on-year in every one of our reporting segments. Going forward, we intend to carefully and appropriately allocate capital within a range of 3.5% to 4% of sales. More detailed definitions for our Group performance and Group financial KPIs can be found in the glossary on the inside back cover.

It excludes the one-off impact of an increasing provision for customer redress payments including Payment Protection Insurance 'PPI'. Performance Trading profit fell by 15 % impacted by the unwinding of the fair value provision - an accounting adjustment made at the time of acquisition in 2008 - and the run-off in legacy income from the Bank's insurance distribution arrangement with Direct Line Group, which terminated last year. Before these items, profits grew well and are up 13%, with a particularly pleasing performance in customer lending. To put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do Reduction in CO2e emissions from existing stores 09 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 8.5% 4.6% 3.9% 4.9% Definition The year-on-year reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per square foot of sales area from existing stores built before 2006 07. Performance We reduced the CO2e emissions from our stores built before March 2006 by 4.9% compared to last year, exceeding our target of 3.5%, helped by our continued focus across the Group on reducing refrigerant gas leakage. Last year, this KPI included distribution centres 'DCs' in addition to existing stores D. Using this definition, our performance this year is a 4.5% reduction. From next year, we will be measuring the cumulative reduction in CO2e across all of our stores and DCs against a 2006 07 baseline - no matter when they were built. This will simplify our target and is consistent with our 2020 goal to achieve a 50% reduction in emissions per square foot. At the end of 2012 13, we had achieved a reduction of 32.5% towards this goal. These figures have been restated to exclude emissions from existing DCs and from our US operations. D This change was set out in the 2011 12 CR report and the previous year's figures are adjusted accordingly. Additional information can be found at www. Greenhouse gas 'GHG' emission reporting This is a new addition to our Annual Report ahead of the upcoming UK legislation on mandatory greenhouse gas 'GHG' emission reporting that we expect to come into force later this year. This year our carbon footprint was 5.75 million tonnes of CO2e. Our overall carbon intensity has decreased by 30% since 2006 07.

Performance We were just behind our stretching target of 74% and we are confident that we have good plans in place to improve our performance in 2013 14 and beyond. We know that we will only succeed if we have strong relationships with our suppliers. We are launching a new Commercial Food Support Office and simplifying our systems to make it easier for suppliers to do business with us. We will work more closely with suppliers to develop joint business plans and recognise success through our Supplier Values Awards. Donation of pre-tax profits to charities and good causes PS78.1m Definition Our contribution to charities and good causes through direct donations, cause-related marketing, gifts-in-kind, staff time and management costs. Performance We have donated PS78.1 million to charities and good causes this year, compared to PS74.6 million in 2011 12. As a proportion of statutory profit before tax our donations represent 4.0% - an increase on last year's figure of 1.9% reflecting the decline in profits this year. This equates to 2.2% of underlying profit before tax, similar to 1.9% on the same basis last year. We expect to maintain a broadly similar level of contributions going forward with the percentage proportion returning to our usual historical levels in the coming years. Total cash donations for 2012 13 were PS22.2 million. To be a creator of highly valued brands Customer loyalty 8 markets - 1st or 2nd place Source: Market research GFK, Ipsos, Kantar. Definition The number of markets where we are placed first or second for the proportion of customers who do over 50% of their shopping with a single retailer. Performance Building customer loyalty is at the heart of Tesco and we are already ranked first in seven of our markets. This is an important indicator of the strength of the Tesco brand. We earn our customers' loyalty by delivering a great shopping experience and rewarding them for their custom. We now have loyalty schemes in each of our markets. Group-wide own-label participation 38% Tesco own-label brands Definition Own-label sales as a proportion of total Group sales. Own-label sales include Tesco brands such as F&F, Finest or Venture brands and unbranded products, such as produce. Tesco Bank and Tesco Mobile are not included. Performance Group own-label participation was stable in the year. Improving the range and quality of our own-label products is an important part of our plan to improve the shopping trip for customers in the UK. We built on the Everyday Value relaunch early in 2012 13 with range additions in September and made significant improvements in the core Tesco own-label range of products throughout the year. The strategy of improving our Tesco brands will continue in 2013 14. To build our team so that we create more value Colleague retention 91% in the UK Definition The proportion of colleagues with over one year's service who have worked for Tesco in the UK throughout the year. Performance Our retention rate in the UK remains strong, up from 90% in 2011 12. This reflects our focus on creating good jobs and long-term careers, with excellent benefits and career development opportunities. It is also a reflection of our determined and ongoing efforts to make what matters to our colleagues better. For example, through our UK Plan we have made significant investments in training and equipment for our colleagues, supporting them to do their jobs. Colleagues being trained for their next role 5.8% across the Group Definition The proportion of colleagues who are on development programmes training for their next role. Performance Giving our colleagues the opportunity to get on at Tesco is very important to us and we are proud of our commitment to this area. This KPI measures the number of colleagues being trained for their next job through our dedicated 'Options' programme and we narrowly missed this year's increased target of 6% of colleagues. This measure doesn't include other development activities such as apprenticeships, A-level Entry Programmes and our Advanced Leadership Programme. Including these opportunities, almost 7% of colleagues across the Group benefited this year. In addition, we have also heavily invested in our colleagues in the UK this year through our 'Building a Better Tesco' plan. More than 250,000 colleagues in-store have received customer service training, with additional technical training for 36,000 colleagues. 20 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Financial review PS72.4bn Group sales PS3.5bn Group trading profit 35.97p Underlying diluted earnings per share 14.76p Full year dividend per share maintained Laurie McIlwee Chief Financial Officer \" As we adapt to ensure we deliver on our objective to be the best multichannel retailer for our customers, we are realistic in our approach to growth and returns.

Group results and strategic update It has been a year in which we have taken decisive action to focus our efforts on those markets where we can have a leadership position. We exited Japan and launched our strategic review of the United States, while at the same time taking a more measured approach to our growth in China. We also set an appropriate pace of migration for the Bank, keeping it focused on the needs of our most loyal customers. Most importantly, we have begun the essential process of getting the UK business back on track, making sure we protect and build on one of the most important leadership positions we have. Group trading profit declined by 13.0 %, reflecting our investment in the UK, the impact of regulatory changes in South Korea and the challenging economic conditions in Europe. This trading performance coupled with reduced JV income and higher net finance costs led to a decline in Group underlying profit before tax of 14.5 %. com ar2013 to hear more from Laurie McIlwee and other members of the leadership team. 21 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Group statutory profit before tax declined by 51.5 % to PS1,960 million due to the impact of three main one-off charges: UK property write-down of PS 804 million, following an in-depth review of our property pipeline in the context of our fundamentally different approach to new space and our announcement in April 2012 that we would be reducing the level of new space growth in the UK going forward: Goodwill impairment of PS 495 million, reflecting the impact of differing growth prospects in today's environment for the businesses we acquired in Poland, the Czech Republic and Turkey in the mid 1990s to early 2000s: and Increase of PS 115 million in our provision for potential Payment Protection Insurance claims against Tesco Bank. Based on our progress so far with our strategic review of Fresh & Easy, we have confirmed that the outcome of the review will be an exit from the United States. The results of our business there, in addition to those of our business in Japan, have been classified as discontinued operations in these results. Segmental results UK It is a year since we unveiled our six-part plan to get the UK business back on top form. The UK is absolutely fundamental to the success of the Group, which is why this was our number one priority for the year, and I'm pleased to say the plan is very much on track. We have made the investment as planned and it has led to a clear improvement in performance, both in absolute terms and relative to the market. Total sales rose by 2.6% excluding petrol, and like-forlike performance improved during the course of the year, with a particularly encouraging result at Christmas. UK results 2012 13 PSm % growth UK sales PS48,216m 1.8% UK revenue exc. impact of IFRIC 13 PS43,579m 1.8% UK revenue exc. impact of IFRIC 13 2.6% UK trading profit PS2,272m 8.3 % Trading margin trading profit revenue 5.21% 58 bp When we laid out our plans last year, we described the impact of the investment in terms of a rebasing of our trading margin to 5.2% and the progress we have made in the UK has been achieved whilst delivering a margin absolutely in line with these expectations. The most important judge of progress is the customer and we introduced a new way of measuring customer perceptions back in July - our 'customer viewpoint'. This measures real customer feedback in all of our stores on a regular and frequent basis, across 12 aspects of their shopping trip. Pleasingly, every one of these aspects improved throughout the second half of the year. This underpins our confidence that the underlying improvement we have seen in our trading performance is driven by the changes we have made for customers. While there are a number of drivers that could enable us to improve overall UK margins, we believe the new base of 5.2% is appropriate for the foreseeable future and any outperformance will be reinvested in driving additional improvements in our customer offer. Asia Our Asia performance was in line with expectations and was dominated by the South Korean regulatory changes concerning trading hours. These changes held back headline numbers, and the impact on trading profit was broadly in line with our PS 100 million guidance, with significant levels of Sunday store closures throughout the second half and considerable uncertainty in the market about exactly which stores would be closed and when, impacting operations even when stores were able to open. Following the passing of the legislation in January this year, the situation seems more certain, with more consistent store closures expected on alternate Sundays. As such, we expect the full-year effect of the regulations, combined with the extension of 24-hour trading restrictions to between midnight and 10am, to lead to an incremental impact of around PS 40 million in 2013 14.

In Thailand, like-for-like sales grew by 3.1% and we continued to gain market share. We benefited from a strong opening programme, including almost 300 Express stores and we launched our first dotcom grocery operation in Bangkok in February. We have adopted a more cautious stance in China. We still see an excess amount of new space being opened in the market - ahead of customer demand - and we have moderated our pace of development accordingly, opening just 12 new stores this year and closing five underperforming stores as part of our increased focus on our three strongest regions. Europe Whilst our markets in Europe remain fundamentally attractive, our performance this year was disappointing. Clearly, we faced significant headwinds throughout the year, as macroeconomic uncertainties continued to impact businesses. This had a particularly marked impact on our general merchandise businesses across the region, holding back our overall like-for-like sales performance.

The working capital increase was largely as a result of regulatory impacts in a number of markets and the shortening of order lead times for general merchandise which reduced our creditor days. Our return on capital employed, on a continuing operations basis and prior to the impact of one-off charges, is 12.7%. This is a 200 basis point decline on returns calculated on a similar basis for last year, mainly reflecting the trading profit performance. We continued to see strong investor demand for our property during the year. We launched the Tesco Lotus Retail Growth Freehold and Leasehold Property Fund along with a number of transactions in the UK and South Korea, contributing to profits arising on propertyrelated items of PS370 million. The market value of our property across the Group currently exceeds PS38 billion. Since becoming Chief Financial Officer I have made it a priority to improve our debt metrics. Resetting the UK margin, regulatory challenges in South Korea and a disappointing profit performance in Europe have stalled the improvements we have made to date. It is a high priority for the Group to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating. Our target on net indebtedness remains unchanged and it should be achieved within the next couple of years. Fixed charge cover is more challenging because our gross debt has long maturity periods. We have PS2 billion of debt that we can potentially retire over the next three years. Our lower level of sale and leasebacks will help slow down the rising rent bill. Both of these will benefit fixed charge cover. Our improved cash flow growth will help improve retained cash flow to adjusted net debt, a key credit rating measure, underpinning our commitment to maintain a strong investment grade rating. Looking forward - our approach to growth and returns The actions we have taken over the last two years have removed a number of significant barriers to progress and underpin our more disciplined approach to capital allocation. As we adapt to ensure we deliver on our objective to be the best multichannel retailer for our customers, we are realistic in our approach to growth and returns. We can therefore offer clarity to shareholders about how we intend to deliver an appropriate balance of growth and returns in the years ahead. We are managing the business in order to: Generate positive free cash flow Ensure a disciplined allocation of capital within a range of 3.5% to 4% of sales Maintain a strong investment grade credit rating We are therefore allocating our capital to achieve three clear priorities: 1. Continuing to invest in a strong UK business 2. Establishing multichannel leadership in all of our markets 3. Pursuing disciplined international growth Our performance in Hungary and Slovakia, where we enjoy two of our strongest positions, has proved more resilient to the economic headwinds. While our profits in Hungary continued to be held back by the crisis tax this year, this will no longer be applied from the start of our new financial year. In some markets such as the Czech Republic and Poland, we saw increased competitive activity, with those retailers focused on discount small formats faring much better than those - like us - with a greater proportion of larger stores. Our own smaller format stores have performed better than the business as a whole, and our dotcom operations - now in 13 cities in these markets alone - have grown strongly since launch. We have faced particularly intense competition in Turkey, in a year in which we have retrenched from our strategy of pursuing large store expansion to the east of our existing business. Like many other businesses in the country, we faced intense cost-price inflation and the impact of this was exacerbated by a number of one-off, historic issues. The resulting losses contributed to our shortfall versus expectations for European performance. All of our businesses undertake a value in use test each year to justify the carrying value of goodwill. Those businesses acquired in Europe in the 1990s and early 2000s unfortunately face a more difficult market today and different growth prospects as a result. This led to a write-down in the value of acquired goodwill for our businesses in Poland, the Czech Republic and Turkey. Our priority in all of these markets is to get the businesses focused on driving underlying performance and it is for this reason that we will only open 400,000 sq ft of net new selling space in the year ahead. Tesco Bank We were pleased to complete the final stages of migration of Tesco Bank early in the financial year and to be able to get back to focusing on marketing our existing products. Our programme of new products resumed in August with mortgages and more recently, our ISA range. We made progress through the year in banking products, with good growth in both customer accounts and balances. Our insurance business was held back by a very challenging market, with strong downward price pressure in motor insurance. Throughout this period, we focused on ensuring we offer the best products and prices to our loyal Clubcard customers. Tesco Bank results 2012 13 PSm % growth Tesco Bank revenue exc. impact of IFRIC 13 PS1,021m 2.2 % Tesco Bank trading profit PS191m 15.1 % Trading margin trading profit revenue 18.71% 284 bp In recent years, the Bank's profit has been impacted by a couple of non-trading factors - the first, fair value releases and the second, the run-off of our legacy insurance agreement with Direct Line Group. Before these, profits grew well and are up 13% with a particularly pleasing performance in customer lending. In line with the rest of the industry, we have been proactively consulting more widely with our customers on PPI. In light of this contact, it has become necessary to increase our provision for compensation by PS 85 million in the second half. In addition to the PS 30 million provision in the first half, this takes us to a PS 115 million one-off charge. 23 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS This means that, in the current economic environment, investors can expect us to deliver: Mid-single digit trading profit growth Return on capital employed within a range of 12% to 15% Dividend growth, broadly in line with underlying earnings, with a target cover of more than 2 times Generate positive free cash flow Trading profit growth Sustainable ROCE Dividend growth Mid-single digit 12% to 15% range In line with underlying EPS Target cover of more than 2 times Allocate capital within range of 4% down to 3.5% of sales Maintain a strong investment grade credit rating Financial disciplines Guiderails Our approach to growth and returns We will update on our progress in the context of these objectives as part of our future results announcements. As we described earlier, the fundamental change in our approach to new space also has implications for our sale and leaseback programme. Two years ago, we reviewed the programme and announced a steady reduction in the level of divestments, in order to ensure that any property profits released were matched to the level of new profit created by development activities. Given that we have significantly reduced the amount of these activities going forward, we believe that it is appropriate to accelerate the scaling back of the sale and leaseback programme, such that it is unlikely to make a material contribution after the next few years. Our reported underlying profit measure currently includes these property profits and related items, and therefore its growth over the next few years would be held back by this accelerated reduction. We will therefore disclose and adjust for this impact when using underlying earnings per share as the basis for our dividend policy. In doing so, we will better align dividend growth to the key targeted profit performance measure for the business. Growth has always been a central part of the investment case for Tesco. To be clear, it is still at the core of the investment case, but it is now a sustainable level of growth - a growth that enables us to deliver improving returns and a much stronger level of cash generation. The guidance we are sharing is for mid-single digit trading profit growth. This takes into account the structurally changing retailing environment and the lower growth outlook for economies and consumer spending around the world. We are determined to achieve this growth in a balanced way and we see the application of our financial disciplines as an important part of ensuring it is delivered in a way that supports strong, sustainable and attractive returns going forward. We will tightly control our capex. There will likely be a very small increase in 2013 14, as we push on at pace with our refresh plans in the UK. Following this, we will move quickly into and then down through the range we have set out of 4% down to 3.5% of sales. Importantly this will enable us to move to a position where we can produce free cash flow without the historic requirement for property proceeds. This is clearly a significant change from our historic cash flow shape. For a number of years, we relied on property proceeds to fund our investment, as capex exceeded available cash. We are getting close to a position where capex is broadly equivalent to available cash, removing our reliance on these proceeds. From then on, available cash grows and exceeds capex, giving us much greater flexibility from a cash point of view. Protecting our strong position in the UK is still one of our highest priorities. The best returns now are from refreshing our existing stores and investing in the broader multichannel opportunities of convenience and online. We will not invest in those large-store schemes where we see unacceptable returns. We will, of course, continue our process of making our existing large stores even more compelling destinations with the repurposing of space. Our next priority is Asia where modern retail is still very underdeveloped. We will continue to strengthen our positions in Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea. In China, we still see a huge opportunity, although our approach going forward is more measured, focused on stand-alone retail sites in the three regions where we have critical mass and good margins. We will build out the remaining 13 Lifespace malls, but are not committing capital to any new freehold investments beyond these. Finally, in Europe, our large-store networks are largely complete and we are effectively at a maintenance level of capex. Specific capital investments will be considered, but these will be about improving the assets we have and expanding in low capital formats such as the internet and convenience. More of our capital will be going into already high-returning businesses and into driving forward returns in our immature businesses. This allocation will enable us to produce a steady improvement in return on capital employed from the current base, within a range of 12% to 15%. The approach I have laid out above provides appropriate and realistic objectives for the business. As we deliver our objective of being the leading multichannel retailer, we are determined to do even better - for customers and for shareholders. Laurie McIlwee Chief Financial Officer",

This is a business with an unusual range and depth of core competencies: it has outstanding operational effectiveness: it understands deeply what it means to orientate a business around the customer: it is passionate, and successful, about developing talent from within: and it manages a complex operating environment with great team work. \" Nearly six months after taking over from Sir David Reid, it is good to have this opportunity to share my perspective on recent developments which I will do under three headings: context: transition: and governance. Context There are many things that strike a newcomer to Tesco. This is a business with an unusual range and depth of core competencies: it has outstanding operational effectiveness: it understands deeply what it means to orientate a business around the customer: it is passionate, and successful, about developing talent from within: and it manages a complex operating environment with great team work. It is also a business that is not afraid to learn and change, capacities perhaps more than any others which are essential to long-term growth. In this respect there are three areas in particular worth identifying. First, Tesco is a business with significant strategic optionality. It has expertise and capital, human and financial, that can be leveraged in different geographies, in different sectors of retailing and through new and different channels, notably of course the internet. The development of these opportunities can make Tesco a stronger company and benefit the UK as a whole. And with such opportunity also comes responsibility - to ensure that the trade-offs between different investments are reached in a disciplined way: and that the optimum balance is struck overall between current returns and future growth. Second, as the business grows internationally, it is important not only that we explain ourselves to the world but also that we listen and see ourselves as others do. Since arriving at Tesco last year I have visited many different parts of the business around the world, met many of our staff, talked to shareholders, suppliers, commentators, community leaders and to customers. This is the broader context of our business to which we need continuously to relate, openly, honestly and constructively for the long-term benefit of our business. Third, I have been impressed by the skills, commitment and values held by the people who work at Tesco and all of whom not only contribute to its success but make the company what it is. They are a great team and all those with a stake in Tesco have reason to admire and be grateful for their efforts. I would like to thank them, on behalf of the whole Board, for all that they do. Transition This has been a year of transition. Philip Clarke took over as Chief Executive at the beginning of the year and he has been shaping both the organisation of the business and the management team which inevitably, after a long period of stability, are entering a period of change and development. This work takes time but is essential to our future as a strong and profitable company. All successful companies go through periods of transition. Indeed, the capacity to change and develop over time is fundamental to truly world-class companies. The critical issue for those responsible is to fully acknowledge the need for and to manage change in a measured and timely fashion when it is called for.

The challenge of refocusing the UK business to ensure it sustains healthy market leadership is important enough to make it worth giving up some profit in the short term to safeguard the business in the long term. We laid out in April how we intend to do this. Elsewhere, we have continued the substantial re-orientation of the US business to give it the best possible opportunity to secure its future with all the potential for longer-term growth that would bring. We have announced our intention to exit from Japan. We are willing to invest for the long term but where we cannot see a profitable, scalable business earning good returns within an acceptable timescale, we prefer to pursue better opportunities. And we have slowed down the development of Tesco Bank to increase its focus on quality, service and risk management. These are substantial changes, in management, organisation and business and they need to be seen as part of a continuing process of moving the company forward, making changes where necessary to ensure long-term stability and sustainable profitability. Governance Governance is the framework that articulates a company's values and supports its behaviours. During the year, we updated our governance framework and processes as described in more detail on page 50. An important aspect of these changes was the creation of the Board Corporate Responsibility Committee to ensure that the Board maintains a strategic focus on corporate responsibility in its widest sense, reflecting the importance to the Group of how it engages externally. When a company has significant economic and social scale it is essential that it reflects on the full nature of its accountability for its activities, and how it should discharge that responsibility to the communities in which it operates. This will be an important focus for the new Committee. There have been a number of changes to the Board. In addition to Sir David Reid, David Potts retired during the year, Richard Brasher stepped down from the Board in March, and Andrew Higginson will retire in September. We thank them all for their contribution to the business over the years. We are also pleased to welcome Deanna Oppenheimer to the Board as a Non-executive Director. Deanna brings valuable international, retail, banking and digital experience to our Board. Financial results In the year, we delivered sales growth of 7.4%. Profit growth was modest, with a strong international performance largely offset by a reduction in UK profits. Trading profit grew by 1.3%, and profit before tax grew by 5.3%. Return on capital employed improved from 12.9% last year to 13.3%, and we continued our long record of dividend growth for shareholders, with the full year dividend up 2.1% to 14.76p. The fact that in a year when economic headwinds have been evident in practically every part of the globe our business increased sales, profits, return on capital and dividends speaks for its overall resilience. Looking ahead Last year was a challenging one for the business and we are acutely aware that this was reflected for our shareholders in the share price. We will continue in 2012 13 to address long-standing business issues in the UK and elsewhere in order to secure future prosperity as well as ensuring that our financial and human resources are developed and deployed where they are able most effectively to generate future growth and returns. If I have one overriding impression of Tesco after six months, it is that here is a truly international business, deploying its expertise across the world to drive opportunity, growth and returns, all of which ultimately benefit the UK. I look forward to being part of it. Sir Richard Broadbent Chairman Chairman's statement 2 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 \"My first year as Chief Executive has been a year where we have implemented important changes at Tesco, a year when we have built strength for the future. \" It has been a year of significant change and one in which we took decisive action on some very important issues for Tesco: our reset of expectations for the UK for the forthcoming year, the announcement of our intention to dispose of our business in Japan, the focus on moving Fresh & Easy closer to profitability and the renewed focus on delivering a reliable Tesco Bank. As a part of this we made several key management changes during the year which have allowed some significant new appointments as we renew and reinvigorate the Tesco team. This has very much laid the ground for the future: a future where we will make sure that our capital and our talent are put to work where it benefits most our customers and hence our shareholders. The future Tesco will demonstrate greater innovation and creativity as we address the needs of consumers around our world - both in store and online. We regularly deliver over 75 million shopping trips a week and as a retailer are only as good as the last trips. Ensuring that Tesco is highly valued by customers on each and every one of those shopping trips will be what makes Tesco achieve sustainable success. That is what we set out to do every day. I believe that we have faced into challenges with real determination and taken decisions for the future. I know that it has been a tough year to be a Tesco shareholder. I know too that my whole team and I are confident that the changes we are making are the right things to do - for customers, staff, the business and its shareholders - and that the long-term opportunities for Tesco remain undiminished.

Whilst the year gave us many things to be proud of, overall it was not the most pleasing performance. My team and I are resolved to get Tesco back to winning, particularly at home. Group sales increased by 7.4% to PS72 billion, while Group trading profit was up 1.3% on last year and underlying profit before tax rose to PS3.9 billion, an increase of 1.6%. Group capital expenditure in the year was PS3.8 billion. Group return on capital employed 'ROCE' increased - to 13.3% last year 12.9%. The Board has proposed a final dividend of 10.13p per share, taking the full year dividend to 14.76p, which is an increase of 2.1% on last year. The decisions we have taken during the year have had an impact on our financial performance. We decided to forego some short-term profit to re-invest in the long-term health of the business, with a clear focus on improving the shopping trip for customers. The UK business clearly did not meet our own expectations in the year and, partly as a result of this, we decided to accelerate our plan to make improvements which has meant a necessary reset to expectations for our growth in 2012 13 as well. This acceleration and reset were announced with our Christmas trading update in January. Despite this significant re-investment programme, we remain committed to driving higher returns for shareholders. Although our investment plans in the UK make achieving our ROCE target more challenging in the short term, we still expect to deliver a ROCE of 14.6% by 2014 15, with broadly based growth from around the Group. Strategic update In last year's Annual Report, I set out an evolution of our strategy into seven parts: To grow the UK core: To be an outstanding international retailer in stores and online: To be as strong in everything we sell as we are in food: To grow retail services in all our markets: To put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do: To be a creator of highly valued brands: and To build our team so that we create more value. This strategy remains as relevant now as it did a year ago and I'm pleased to be able to update you on the progress we have made on each of these strategic objectives. I also set out immediate management priorities for the business last year - keeping the UK strong and growing: becoming outstanding internationally, not just successful: becoming a multi-channel retailer wherever we trade: delivering on the potential of retail services: applying Group skill and scale: and delivering higher returns. You will see how these priorities have shaped our actions through the year. To grow the UK core The deli counter in our Hertford Superstore has a flat glass front, bright lighting and warmer, more engaging signage In the UK, high petrol prices and falling real incomes affected customers' discretionary spending in the year. The combination of disappointing sales in the second half of the year and our decision to increase investment into the shopping trip meant that our UK performance was weaker than planned. Sales grew by 6.2%, supported by excellent new store performance, but trading profit declined by 1.0 %. The issue we are addressing is that the shopping trip just hasn't been improving fast enough and our standards haven't been as consistent as our customers have come to expect. As a result, we are taking action to improve each aspect of the customer offer. This will involve significant revenue and capital investment in a comprehensive plan encompassing six key areas. The UK Plan - Building a Better Tesco Our Plan for the UK business has six elements: Service & Staff: helping our people deliver great service by investment in recruitment, training and equipment, dedicated to particular departments such as produce so that our customers notice the change. Stores & Formats: making our stores better places in which to shop and work, with the pace of new store development moderating, and the pace of refreshing our existing stores stepping up. Price & Value: delivering great value for money through the right blend of price, promotions, couponing and loyalty. Range & Quality: building the right ranges of quality products, reviewing and refreshing our entire range of Tesco brand products, making our ranging more store and format-specific, and bringing dunnhumby, our marketing insight business, back into the heart of Tesco. Brand & Marketing: making sure that we get back to having the right conversation with our customers about Tesco. Clicks & Bricks: making this a potent combination for our customers, with the roll-out of Click & Collect and the transformation of our range and online presence. Chief Executive's review 4 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 We are clear on what we need to do, we have trialled substantial elements of the changes and we know they work. Our investment programme has already started and we expect this to deliver stronger results. The Big Price Drop in September 2011 was the first step, but the changes we are making are about much more than price. They are a combination of price, quality, range and service, including a significant investment to create an additional 20,000 jobs over the next two years. These changes will reinvigorate the shopping trip for customers, and consequently deliver improved performance for shareholders. To be an outstanding international retailer in stores and online Our international businesses performed strongly, with trading profits up 18%, or by 22% before the impact of a crisis tax levied in Hungary. We have seen progress in our established businesses, such as in Central Europe, South Korea and Thailand, and from our newer, rapidly growing businesses, such as Fresh & Easy in the United States and Tesco Malaysia. It is encouraging that we are winning market share in almost all of our markets and, in some countries, at a faster rate than for many years. Asia: another strong performance I am pleased with the performance of our businesses in Asia. Sales and profit grew well - sales by over 10%, and trading profit by over 20%. We delivered solid like-for-like sales growth and an excellent contribution from new stores. Our business in Thailand had an extraordinary year. The worst flooding for 70 years caused us to close over 150 stores temporarily and all four of our distribution depots. The superb dedication of our team enabled us to keep supply lines open for customers and to support staff affected by the flooding, and we have come out of the crisis stronger. We grew like-for-like sales and profits in the year. South Korea had another good year, although I anticipate a modest reduction in like-for-like sales next year as restrictions on trading hours for large retailers are implemented across the country. In China, we have continued to focus on building scale in three regions of the country. With the economic environment currently proving challenging for mainstream retailers, we have decided to take a more cautious stance on the market, at least for now. We have decided not to commit substantial new capital to freehold shopping centres, and we have also elected to hold back on the pace of new hypermarket development this year. We will only open 16 stores, instead of stepping up as we had planned. We still believe that China can be an engine of growth and we can speed up again when the outlook improves. We took an important step this year in deciding to exit Japan. It is right to focus on our larger, profitable and growing businesses in the Asia region. It is never easy to make decisions of this kind and I would like to thank our staff in Japan for their continued hard work and professionalism through this time. Europe: growth in a difficult environment Following a strong performance in Europe in the first half of the year, the performance in the second half was weaker than expected. Sales for the year grew by 8% and trading profit increased marginally, by 0.4%. Trading profit growth would have been in line with sales had it not been for the impact of the crisis tax imposed in Hungary, which cost PS38 million in the year. The economic background was particularly difficult in Hungary and in the Republic of Ireland this year. Given the current conditions, we are focusing on growth primarily through our existing stores in these markets, rather than investing substantial new capital. In addition to these headwinds in two of our largest markets, profits were held back by disruption connected to the opening of our new distribution centre in Poland, but this is behind us now. We have made good progress with the closer integration of our European businesses this year, from sharing infrastructure to buying as a single region. This means that we can leverage the skill and scale of the Tesco Group to deliver a better shopping trip for customers and higher returns for shareholders. One example of this is our recent launch of grocery dotcom in Prague, with initial sales well ahead of plan, and our dotcom business in Warsaw will be launched soon. Our Extra format stores delivered an encouraging performance through the year United States: on the path to profitability It has been a year of encouraging progress in Fresh & Easy. Sales grew by 27%, with almost 12 percentage points coming from like-for-like stores. We have also delivered reduced trading losses for the first time, with an 18% improvement on last year. After four years of rising losses, this is a decisive change of trend, driven by further improvements to our customer offer. Features such as in-store bakeries, more loose produce, additional ranges and new Fresh & Easy products have been very popular with customers and we have seen an acceleration in our already strong growth in customer numbers. The progress we have made gives us more confidence that we will deliver a further significant reduction in losses in the coming year. The timing of break-even will be later than we had previously expected, as we will focus on getting more of our existing stores to reach profitability before we step up the rate of new store openings. We can then reach sufficient scale to cover our substantial central overhead costs and we anticipate that we will reach the break-even point during 2013 14. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 5 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review Strategy in action Business model To be as strong in everything we sell as we are in food It has been tough to achieve growth in sales of discretionary items - not least in the UK, where we have seen a number of specialist general merchandise retailers go into administration - and our UK like-for-like growth in general merchandise, clothing and electricals has remained negative. To adjust to this, we have been allocating more space to the most popular products and improving merchandising. We are committing less capital to new space for non-food and instead focusing more resource on continuing to develop our online capability. We are seeing the early benefits of our changes, but much remains to be done Europe and Asia delivered stronger performances in general merchandise, clothing and electricals, despite subdued consumer confidence even in the better performing economies. I was pleased with the performance of clothing in Central Europe, with sales growing by 12% at constant exchange rates. This is testament to the strength of the F&F brand and also to the performance of our new Extra format stores. We ended the year with 44 of the new Extras in Europe and three in Asia. These stores are introducing our customers to a different way of shopping, with stronger ranging and new services, with extremely encouraging results. Different categories of food and general merchandise have their own distinctive look and feel within the Extra store, known as 'Worlds', such as Baby World and Sports World. We are making similar changes to the look and feel within our large UK stores, partly as a result of the encouraging performances in Europe. To grow retail services in all our markets Tesco Bank is a key part of the potential we see in retail services. Since we took full control of the Bank in 2008, our focus has been on developing our own systems and infrastructure and recruiting and developing a new team to run the operation. I'm delighted to say that this period of migration from The Royal Bank of Scotland 'RBS' to our own platforms is now nearing an end. Building a bank is a complex task and I took the decision during the year to slow down the migration, so as to minimise the customer impact. This final stage of migration will be completed imminently, at which point the business can put more emphasis on growth and on developing the potential we see in financial services. We have delivered good business growth in the year with revenue up 14%, driven by a good performance in the insurance business. The Bank's profit figure includes several accounting adjustments, so we measure business performance using baseline profitability, which increased by a very encouraging 29%. The Bank's capital position has also remained strong through the year, supported by a 7% growth in savings balances. With the migration almost completed, the Bank is well positioned for future growth. We are also on track to launch new products, starting with mortgages, to broaden into a full-service retail bank. Customers can purchase insurance and other Tesco Bank products in store, alongside their weekly shop Chief Executive's review 6 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 To put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do We have reinforced our commitment to be a good corporate citizen this year: as a retailer, an employer and a neighbour. We employ over half a million people worldwide, which allows us to make a real difference in the communities where we operate. Our core business involves two vital roles in the heart of the community: providing customers with safe, good quality, affordable, nutritious food and creating good jobs and careers. Beyond this, we have demonstrated that we put our responsibilities to communities at the heart of what we do in a huge variety of ways: I want to pay tribute to just some of the great achievements of the last year. Even when their own homes were in danger or flooded, our people in Thailand went to extraordinary lengths for customers. Some even gave up their days off and travelled for hours by boat to continue to get essential supplies to our customers. There is no better example of our colleagues living true to the Tesco Values: 'No one tries harder for customers' and 'Treat people how we like to be treated'. Our responsibility to our people is to provide them with good jobs and careers. In the last year, we have created thousands of jobs across our businesses, invested in a state-of-the-art, zero-carbon training academy in South Korea and have continued our work in the employment of young people, university graduates and the long-term unemployed. Our customer offering is based on strong relationships with our suppliers. For example, we now have supplier academies in all of our Central European markets for suppliers to present their products to our buyers. This enables us to support the growth of our suppliers whilst sourcing the best local and regional products for our customers. Any business on the scale of Tesco has the opportunity to make a significant difference in tackling climate change. We were proud to be recognised by the Carbon Disclosure Project again this year, with Tesco named the top retailer in the world. We will continue our work as we progress towards our ambitious target of being a zero-carbon business by 2050. Our state-of-the-art, zero-carbon training academy in South Korea, to train staff from across the Tesco Group To be a creator of highly valued brands Finest sold well over PS1 billion in the UK alone this year. In April 2012 we relaunched Tesco Value as Everyday Value, with quality improvements to hundreds of products Across our markets our own-label programme encompasses a broad spectrum of ranges to appeal to diverse customer needs, giving customers the quality products they are looking for at competitive prices. In the last year we have expanded our offering, launching new ranges such as Venture Brands in the UK and Europe - including Chokablok chocolate and ice cream and Carousel children's toys - which offer customers premium quality at great prices. We have started to differentiate our ranges more clearly, such as our sub-brands Gourmet and Eat Well in Fresh & Easy and Goodness, which is a range of healthy and nutritious children's products now also available in the UK. We recently relaunched our UK Tesco Value range as Everyday Value, with quality improvements to hundreds of products and new, brighter packaging. This is the first stage in a refresh of our entire range of over 8,000 Tesco brand products in the UK in the next two years, including a comprehensive update to our Tesco Standard range. This is an area of substantial and growing strategic importance for us, as we recognise the role that our brands play in attracting customers and as we start to leverage our expertise in brand management across our markets. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 7 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review Strategy in action Business model To build our team so that we create more value Strengthening our management This time last year we were in the early days of some of our new management structures. I had just introduced a matrix structure throughout Tesco with CEOs for each of our key business areas - the UK, Asia, Europe, and the US - supported by integrating functions, such as Property, Human Resources and Marketing. I am very pleased with how this structure has bedded in and expect to see even greater value creation as a result. The introduction of a dedicated UK Operating Board has enabled greater focus at home and given the importance of the changes we are currently making for customers, I have recently decided to assume direct responsibility for the UK business during the process of its renewal. I have continued to strengthen both the Executive Committee and our senior management teams through the last year, drawing on our deep pool of internal talent. We have also been fortunate to welcome our new Chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, following Sir David Reid's decision to retire. I want to thank David for his lasting contribution to Tesco over 26 years on our Board and, on a personal level, for all the help he has given me in settling into my role as CEO. Building the Tesco team We will create 20,000 more jobs in the UK over the next two years and many more around the world Tesco's most important asset will always be its people, who live by our Values to do their very best for customers. Many of our plans for the coming year are built on investment in our people. We employ more than half a million people across the globe and this will continue to increase, with plans to create an additional 20,000 jobs in the UK alone in the coming two years and to continue to grow our teams around the world. It is the quality, commitment and dedication of our people that gives me so much confidence that we can and will achieve our plans for the years ahead. Delivering higher returns In April last year we set out a target to increase our already good level of ROCE to 14.6% by 2014 15. Although it is likely that we will see a small reduction in 2012 13 as a result of our UK investment plans, we continue to see a number of opportunities to drive returns and we still expect to deliver our targeted increase to 14.6% by 2014 15. Doing the right thing I am confident that we are ready to tackle whatever challenges lie ahead. The decisive action that we have taken in the past year and the management changes which have reinvigorated the Tesco team have laid the ground for the future: a future where we will make sure that our capital and our talent are put to work where it benefits most our customers and hence our shareholders. We have and will continue to focus on doing the right thing for customers, for communities, for staff, for the business and for our shareholders.

Focusing on food first, we are making a PS1 billion commitment this year to improve the shopping trip, driving a strong pace of improvement in the things that matter for customers - service, range, quality, price, availability and the store environment. Creating more good jobs and careers Over the next two years, we will create 20,000 new jobs to deliver new levels of excellence in customer service. Customers will benefit from more staff on the shop floor at busy times, greater staff expertise and enhanced service across the store. The investment goes to the heart of our promise to create good jobs and careers, with opportunities focused on young people who are currently unemployed. British Prime Minister David Cameron described the investment as \"a massive confidence boost for the UK economy\". The Fruit and Veg team Fresh food is an area where customers really appreciate having dedicated, specially trained and knowledgeable staff. With the additional investment in staffing, training and equipment, the Fruit and Veg team can focus on fresh produce, improving product availability and presentation for customers. We are also increasing the number of staff across the whole of fresh food - meat, produce and chilled convenience foods. More staff, better service One of the largest elements of our investment is in increased staffing levels, training and equipment for key departments in existing stores - such as produce and meat. We saw marked improvements in customers' perceptions and sales performance of 200 pilot stores. This success has given us the confidence to move quickly to apply these changes to all of our large stores - an investment of over PS200 million. We are improving the look and feel of many of our fresh departments using more engaging signage, stronger graphics, warmer colours and better lighting 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 The Big Price Drop In September 2011, we launched The Big Price Drop, investing more than PS500 million to reduce the prices of over 3,000 everyday products. Big Price Drops target the products that customers buy week in, week out. The progress is encouraging and we're now more competitive. It's an important step in the journey but there's more to do to get the blend right on price, promotions, couponing and loyalty. Quality and innovation We are reviewing and refreshing our entire range of over 8,000 Tesco brand products starting with the relaunch of Tesco Value as Everyday Value, with quality improvements to hundreds of products. Helping customers manage on tight budgets, Value was already growing at twice the rate of the market as a whole: these changes will further strengthen its position. We will also be comprehensively updating our other Tesco ranges this year. We have already stepped up the pace of innovation with our new Venture Brand exclusive products - such as Chokablok ice cream, Parioli authentic Italian ranges and the Latham's range of premium pet food. With such a strong variety of ranges to appeal to the needs of different customers, we will also be applying more personalisation and localisation in stores to help them tailor their ranges much more for their local area. Over the page Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 11 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review Strategy in action Business model 11 UK: Refreshing our stores for customers and staff The way stores look and feel is an important part of the shopping trip. Customers wanted a warmer, friendlier look and feel, so we have accelerated our Refresh programme to improve the environment in all our stores. Bakery Customers love being able to choose from freshly baked breads and cakes and see our bakers at work in the background. Displaying the goods in baskets, not on standard shelves, also helps to make our bakeries much more appealing. Investing over PS200 million of additional capital, we will refresh 430 stores in the coming year, representing about 25% of our UK space. Bringing in a warmer, friendlier look and feel will go hand in hand with our work on quality and range, so that we offer customers great products displayed in an attractive, inviting store environment. Listening to our staff Most of our changes are visible to customers but we are making some equally important changes behind the scenes. We ran a programme this year for staff to email or text in comments about what they felt needed to be fixed in their stores. With 40,000 comments received, we'five responded by rolling out new and better equipment, like checkout chairs and handheld printers. This has helped deliver the best staff Viewpoint feedback survey results for five years. The Extra format Customers are noticing the changes we are making in stores across all of our formats - Extra, Superstores, Metro and Express - but we're also making some changes that particularly affect our larger stores. We're drawing on the great success of our new Extra format in Europe to make sure that our UK Extras continue to meet our customers' changing needs, as they increasingly combine shopping in store and online. Future investment In the last few years, both convenience and online shopping have been growing rapidly. While our existing large stores in the UK perform very well, recognising the current economic climate and the growing importance of online shopping, we are not planning to open many more of the very biggest. Instead, more of our investment is going into refreshing our existing stores. New investment will be channelled into Express stores and our online offer. Fixtures and fittings, lighting and space We are refreshing our stores, inside and out, to make them more inviting. Wooden cladding and brighter signage welcome customers into the store. Inside, different areas are being given a more distinctive look and feel, such as wooden fixtures in Bakery, or sleek shelving and lighting in Health & Beauty. Our produce aisles are more spacious, and our counters have less functional, more engaging signage, flat glass fronts and better lighting, to show off our meat, fish, cheese and deli products at their best.

We will add 700 new collection points for Tesco Direct orders in the next year - customers can already collect from over 770 stores, including 70 Express stores. We will also continue to increase the number of stores with collection points for grocery, as well as trialling convenient joint collection points. Clothing The UK clothing market, worth PS33 billion, is one of the few areas of discretionary spend that continues to grow and is a category where the internet has so far had a limited impact. Our Central European Extras have shown us that Clothing tends to benefit from more space and better lighting on the shop floor, as customers love seeing more of our range. As well as giving Clothing more space in store, we will be improving the ranges and quality we offer to ensure broad appeal. Retail services The services we offer in store - like an optician, pharmacy, phone shop or customer restaurant - all help customers to get more out of their everyday shopping trip. We ended the year with over 180 opticians and are planning to increase the number of our phone shops to over 260 in the coming year. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 13 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review Strategy in action Business model Online grocery When we first launched a grocery home shopping service in 1997 we were viewed as pioneers, and we have grown to be the world's largest and most profitable online grocery retailer with sales of well over PS2 billion. As technology moves forward so do we. We use it to help make shopping easier for customers with a mobile web platform for shopping on the go, features like 'Favourites' and tailored online offers developed for Tesco via analysis from dunnhumby, our marketing insight business. Where customer demand is very high we have complemented our in-store picking model with a number of specialised dotcom-only stores. In January, we opened our fourth in Enfield. We currently fulfil over 80% of London orders from our dotcom-only stores, providing our customers with our total food range - more than can be offered from any one store. Growing our online businesses in all our markets is a strategic priority for us and it shows how we are adapting to our customers' changing needs. Stores continue to sit at the heart of our business, but we are aiming to become a multi-channel retailer wherever we trade. Customers increasingly expect to be able to shop where, when and how they want: the boundary between stores and online is blurring. In developing our online offer, we are drawing on our convenient store network and our expertise to meet our customers' needs and help make their lives easier, progressing towards an offering where customers can shop with us 'anywhere, any time, any how'. We'five taken online far beyond everyday grocery shopping. Digital technology allows us to meet the 'on the go' needs of our customers - with you can stream entertainment on the move and with our virtual stores in South Korea you can even shop during your commute to work. We want to offer our customers convenient options to shop with us using those access points - stores, computers and mobile devices - which are part of their daily lives. Whether customers want to shop on the move using their smartphones, or take their time at home, we are innovating to help them shop however they want, with quick and easy apps and improved platforms. Tesco Direct We have upgraded our Tesco Direct website to better showcase our great quality range and offer customers improved functionality and ease of use. For the first time it is now configured for mobile devices. We will be moving our other UK Clothing and Entertainment websites onto the same platform later in the year. By Christmas we will have increased our Direct range to 200,000 items, thanks in part to third-party Sellers. Having introduced our first Sellers at Tesco Direct recently, we are offering our customers additional ranges teamed with Clubcard points and convenient store collection points, while our Seller Partners benefit from our volume of online traffic and expertise.

In the next few years, we are planning to launch online grocery shopping in at least one major city in each of our markets, using our operating model to roll this out quickly and cost-effectively. In Asia, we're innovating to access the biggest opportunities - for example, in addition to our online grocery service, our virtual stores in South Korea enable busy customers to shop on their way to work. The Homeplus app has been downloaded over a million times. Social media As our customers spend an increasing amount of time online we are able to use social media to build trust and understanding of our business. This in turn helps to drive loyalty. We have built our business on listening to our customers and acting on their feedback. Social media allows us to have conversations with them on any issue at any time - in the UK, we now have more than 680,000 'likes' on our Facebook page. In 2011 we acquired BzzAgent - a unique business combining word-of-mouth marketing with a commercial application of social media, helping to drive consumer advocacy and broaden our capability and innovation in product marketing. Social media also helps us to be more effective and innovative in existing tasks such as recruitment and staff communication. For example, our staff use Yammer - a private social network for businesses - to share best practice and celebrate success, often by posting photos, and we use it operationally for sharing messages and asking for feedback. Click & Collect Click & Collect is a key component of our multi-channel offering. Our store and distribution networks mean we can give customers the opportunity to pick up products whenever it suits them from over 770 stores, close to where they live or work. 70% of online general merchandise orders are handled in this way. Click & Collect is becoming increasingly relevant for all product groups. We currently have 45 stores that offer grocery Click & Collect and we expect this number to increase quickly. Our customers appreciate this innovative, quick and convenient service which fits well into their busy schedules. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 15 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review Strategy in action Business model Consistent property blueprints As we continue to grow our international businesses there is a significant opportunity to make savings from applying standardised property blueprints. With the same specialist team designing the stores, we can build great stores for customers more quickly, more cheaply and with a reduced carbon footprint. We also ensure the new space is best used by reducing the space given to offices and chillers in the back, providing more room on the shop floor. Customers love local and regional products: we pride ourselves on having local people running our operations: and we use local knowledge to source and to allocate space to the most popular products. However, lots of what we do - especially behind the scenes - is best done in the same way across our markets. We are increasingly realising our vision to win locally by applying our skills globally. 'Group skill and scale' describes this step in our evolution to becoming a global business. By Group skill, we mean applying expertise from individual countries to all of our markets: Clubcard is a great example. Having invested millions of pounds to develop the UK scheme in the late 1990s, we have been able to introduce a loyalty scheme to each of our markets for a fraction of the cost. By Group scale, we mean using the size of the Tesco business to benefit our customers by lowering prices, improving quality, and sourcing new and different products from the best suppliers around the world. Globally sourcing food, general merchandise, and the goods that we use in store is one way that we are doing this. We buy some products from the same source for all our markets, such as bananas, and we buy others for a whole region, such as F&F clothing for Central Europe. Buying on a larger scale means that we can achieve a better cost price and create headroom to invest in improving the shopping trip for customers. Since the mid-1990s, we have built an international business of more than 3,200 stores, which delivered more than PS1 billion trading profit for the first time this year. As we strive to become an outstanding international retailer, we are drawing on Tesco's skill and scale to move into the next phase of growth. International: Moving into the next phase of growth Since the mid-1990s, we have built an international business with more stores than we have in the UK, which has delivered more than PS1 billion trading profit for the first time - larger than any of our UK competitors. With strong market positions, we are well positioned to move into the next phase of growth. 11 12 trading profit excludes Japan, which has been treated as discontinued following our decision to sell the business. 10 11 has been re-presented to be consistent. The data up to and including 05 06 is statutory operating profit: from 06 07 it is trading profit.

These formats are not only great for customers but are also cost-effective, utilising our existing distribution networks and requiring less capital. One platform, many markets - the best everywhere Rolling out the same processes and systems across the Group delivers a better shopping trip for lower cost. Shelf-ready packaging and best practice replenishment processes support great availability for customers in store, while warehouse processes minimise stock loss and wastage. We increase back-office efficiency through our shared service centre in India with the same team designing common features, such as self-service checkouts, for all our markets. Reaping the benefits of centralised distribution As we buy more and more products on a regional or global scale, it becomes easier and more effective to organise our distribution across borders. We have opened new depots in Poland and China this year, building them to a Group blueprint and implementing best practice processes, equipment and systems. Rolling out services At year end, we had 47 of our Extra format stores internationally. These stores offer customers a whole range of services, such as photo shops, opticians and phone shops, for relatively low investment as they use existing hypermarket space and customer footfall. Retail financial services are well established in Thailand and South Korea, where Tesco partners with leading financial services providers, and in an earlier stage of development in another seven of our markets. Invest in the best local offer Identify best practice and roll out in all markets Work together where it makes sense Winning locally, applying our skills globally Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 17 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review Strategy in action Business model Diversity and complexity A market of China's scale brings not only significant opportunities but also huge diversity and complexity. To be successful, we need a deep understanding of regional, provincial and city-level differences, as well as an ability to leverage our global expertise and systems in order to build scale. Our vision of winning locally by applying our skills globally is key to our ambition to drive long-term, sustainable growth in China. The importance of being local... Even within a single region temperatures, tastes and preferred brands can all vary, so our operation is 'local' in many ways. For example, our buying teams are based in different regions and even in specific provinces and cities to be close to our customers and suppliers. We have appointed more local Directors this year to strengthen our China Board and have ongoing plans to recruit and develop local talent.... and operating responsibly Our stores are active in their local communities, for example through 'Care for the Needy', where we donate daily essentials to elderly and infirm people. Drawing on our Group expertise and technologies, our new distribution centre in Jiashan uses 45% less energy than a traditional depot. These are just two examples of how we operate responsibly through a combination of being local and applying our skills globally. Group skill and scale Tesco's skill and scale are crucial to differentiating our business in China. Our new distribution centre was an important first step to streamlining our supply chain, allowing us to buy on a greater scale and giving us more control over the storage and transportation of fresh produce. Drawing on our brand capabilities, we have recently relaunched the packaging for 250 of our own-brand products, with hundreds more to follow in the coming year. Our Shenyang Extra store has benefited from the success of our new format in Europe, with the senior team trained in our Extra store in Bratislava, Slovakia. Our strategy in China is to focus on building scale in three regions which together have a population of over 600 million. China: three regions the size of countries North region Hymall opened here in 2001 and 11 years later we have 39 stores trading. Our first Extra opened in Shenyang in December. Freezing cold in winter, our clothing and food ranges are very different to the East and South A large, rapidly growing market, China offers real long-term potential for growth, despite a currently challenging consumer environment. East region The 'home' of Tesco in China is Shanghai and here we are trading our first Express convenience stores South region Present in this region for only four years, we continue to adapt our offer to meet consumer needs in this warmer part of China International: Footholds in newer markets 18 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 The Fresh & Easy shopping trip Our Fresh & Easy business is about wholesome, fresh, high-quality food in the heart of the neighbourhood, with great staff giving the best customer service. We have made changes this year to bring out these features and give them more prominence in our stores. With a friendlier store environment and atmosphere, the quality of our fresh and prepared produce more apparent and the launch of our Friends card to thank our loyal customers, we have driven 12% like-for-like sales growth this year and total sales growth of 27%. The journey to profitability The results of these changes mean that we are more confident about the outlook for the business, although clearly much remains to be done. We have reduced trading losses by 18% and are on track for another significant reduction in 2012 13, even if the timing of break-even will now be later than our earlier expectation. This is because we will focus on more stores reaching profitability first, before pushing on faster with the expansion we need to create sufficient scale to cover our overheads. We ended the year with 185 stores and will have approaching 230 stores by the end of the coming year. The changes we have made to stores this year are building real momentum in Fresh & Easy, driving growing customer numbers and sales and delivering reduced losses for the first time.

In just over three years we have developed a completely new infrastructure for the business, built up a new team and brought in new expertise - effectively building a new bank from scratch. We are now completing the very final stages of this huge project, as we move towards offering a full-service retail bank. At its core, Tesco Bank is underpinned by the Tesco brand and Clubcard, and its operations are effective because of our people, systems and IT. Being part of Tesco delivers benefits for customers and Tesco Bank. For example, the insight we gain from Clubcard allows us to understand our customers' needs well, helping us to provide them with the most relevant offers in a clear and simple way and at a great price. Tesco Clubcard credit card rewards customers with Clubcard points whenever they use their card. Clubcard customers can also receive preferential deals when buying Tesco Bank products - including discounts on car, home, pet and travel insurance - and can use Clubcard points to buy Tesco Bank insurance. This year, Tesco Bank gave customers around PS70 million of Clubcard points to spend in store or on Clubcard rewards. The Tesco Values sit at the heart of Tesco Bank. Our core purpose is 'To create value for customers to earn their lifetime loyalty', so our people focus on providing great customer service. At our Glasgow and Newcastle customer service centres, staff are not incentivised to sell, which means that discussions with customers can focus solely on meeting their banking and insurance needs. Over the last three years, we have built a strong team with experience and expertise, growing dramatically from 300 to 2,800 people. In terms of systems and IT, our new platforms have enabled some significant customer service improvements. Instant decisions are now available on loan applications, and customers can open and fund savings accounts in just ten minutes, which had previously taken around two weeks. While we have completed the majority of the transition from The Royal Bank of Scotland's 'RBS' systems and platforms to our own, we did encounter some technical issues during the summer of 2011. We pride ourselves on being a bank that customers can rely on and trust, and to ensure that the continuing process was as smooth as possible for customers and staff, we decided to slow the remaining transition of our 2.8 million credit card accounts. This is now nearing completion. Even with all this work going on, we have grown the business during 2011 12. The savings book was up 7% versus a market of 3%, and the underlying performance of the Bank remained good, with strong growth in baseline profit which excludes key nontrading provisioning movements. In the last three years, we have seen significant growth across key Bank products. We have laid our foundations for growth and, with the transition from RBS almost complete, we are now in a position to grow the business faster. Tesco Bank brings Tesco's Values, customer focus and trusted brand name to a big market and is differentiated by being a bank that has Tesco at its centre. We offer simple, convenient, value for money products in what can be a highly complex market. Savings and loans: Our savings book continues to grow well, with retail savings deposits increasing by around PS330 million this year. Clubcard insight supports our competitive customer offering and high quality loan book. Even though loan balances have been temporarily reduced this year as we have undergone migration, customer accounts in loans and savings have increased by 30% since 2008. We are continuing to attract new customers who know that the Bank is reliable, trustworthy and good value. Retail services: A Tesco Bank for Tesco customers 20 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 Insurance: Our products help support customers in their daily lives, giving them peace of mind wherever they are. Simple to understand, our range of products continues to prove popular with customers. Around 1.5 million people now insure their cars and homes with Tesco Bank. Since 2008, our car insurance gross written premiums have increased by 39% and pet insurance gross written premiums are up by 44%. Transaction services: Our transaction services - ATMs and travel bureaux - offer customers convenience while they are on the go. Both saw strong growth in the year, with ATM transactions up 9% and travel money transactions up 12%. We ended the year with 3,265 ATMs, up from 2,600 three years ago, and we have close to 200 travel bureaux across our store network. Credit cards: We are increasing our share of the market, with 57% growth in credit card transactions since 2008. Three years ago, Tesco Bank credit cards made up 9% of all MasterCard and Visa credit card transactions in the UK - that figure is now 12%. Customers benefit from the added 'Tesco' extras that come with their credit card, such as collecting one Clubcard point for every PS4 spent. Rates are subject to change and are correct as at April 2012. Fixed rate saver: one-off payment and money cannot be withdrawn until the end of the term. New products: Tesco Bank has been growing well even without new product launches, but the products we'five launched on our own systems have enjoyed huge success. Our Fixed Rate Saver, launched in October 2010, has grown to PS1.5 billion and our retail bonds have attracted investments of PS185 million. These initiatives diversify our funding base and increase the long-term funding available to the Bank. We always want to give our customers the best products and the best experience, so we believe getting it right at launch is more important than rushing the process. Once we have completed the final stage of migration, we can push on faster with more substantial new products, starting with mortgages. Current accounts are planned to follow and we welcome the recommendation of the Independent Commission on Banking to make it easier for customers to switch between banks.

We are committed to being a good neighbour and making a difference to the communities we live and work in, including supporting the causes that matter to our customers and our people. In 2011, Thailand suffered its worst floods in 70 years. At Tesco Lotus our staff went to incredible lengths through immensely difficult conditions to get essential supplies into our stores for customers. Events such as the floods are a reminder of the strength of local communities and how people turn to them in times of need. They are also a reminder of the importance of providing customers with good quality, safe, affordable food, whenever they need it. 22 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 Like all Thai retailers, we faced a major challenge with the flood crisis but at Tesco Lotus the team worked incredibly hard to find ways to get products into store and support local people. Our people came into work even when their own homes were flooded. We used trains and planes to bring products in and worked together across the Group to secure deliveries. Tesco in Malaysia provided three million litres of water and eight million packets of noodles and our global suppliers helped to secure canned fish, eggs and UHT milk. We used our stores as donation centres for customers who wanted to support flood victims and contributed almost PS500,000 of essential products. For our staff affected, we provided financial support as well as relief bags, food, temporary accommodation and transport. Through teamwork at Tesco Lotus and the support of the Group, we were able to help the people of Thailand during this difficult time - a recovery effort that is still continuing. I would like to thank the whole team again for their extraordinary dedication.

At its heart is our core purpose: 'To create value for customers to earn their lifetime loyalty'. 24 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 Sell more Develop economies of scale Buy for less Sell for less Move Sell Buy Insight Building the T esco brand Leveraging Group skill and scale Developing our people Creating valuable property Innovating our offer responsibly Operating Core purpose: To create value for customers to earn their lifetime loyalty -- Core activities -- The virtuous volume circle -- Enablers Core activities Our core business model is simple: we buy, move and sell products and services to our customers and use customer insight to do this slightly better each time. Insight: Improving the customer offer Listening to customers in a wide variety of ways is key to what we do. We engage with customers through a range of focus groups and ongoing research trackers, and actively seek feedback on what is good or not so good, such as through our Every Comment Helps scheme in the UK. Online and social media make it easier to listen and respond to large numbers of customers in real time, through webchats, Facebook and Twitter. The insight from all of these conversations increasingly feeds into the customer offer so that we can continually drive incremental improvements for customers. Our loyalty schemes, such as Clubcard or Legou Tesco Membercard in China, are not only great for our customers but also provide data insight to enable us to continually improve the shopping trip. With a loyalty scheme in all of our markets and around 44 million active customers in total, we are in a unique position to understand customers' shopping patterns. Our marketing insight business, dunnhumby, provides analysis which we feed back into our business model, shaping our product and range development and enabling us to offer customers the best products and promotions for their particular needs. Buy: A great range of products In food, general merchandise and services, we work with our suppliers and develop our brands to bring a great range to our customers. The relationship with our suppliers is the foundation of our customer offer. We work with a broad range of suppliers, from global produce suppliers and international FMCG companies to local suppliers who provide products for a single region in one of our markets. We sell over PS1 billion of local products annually in the UK and, across Europe, our series of 'meet the buyer' events helped us to stock hundreds of new local products this year. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 25 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review Strategy in action Business model Business model With our established private label programme, we produce great quality Tesco brands at a range of price points, from Everyday Value up to Finest. Our product brands also have established market positions. For example, F&F, which is the market leader in clothing in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, is itself diversified into distinct subbrands for different clothing styles. In services, we often work with specialist partners to source the best product offerings. For example, we created a joint venture between Vodafone and Tesco Hungary this year, and Tesco Bank insurance underwriting is primarily provided in partnership with Ageas Insurance Limited. Move: The right products at the right time Our network of distribution centres 'DCs' and advanced technology support a modern, efficient and cost-effective supply chain. An efficient distribution system starts with understanding which products our stores need. First, we forecast what customers will buy, using sophisticated, detailed models to consider variables such as seasonality, weather forecasts and likely response to promotions. Second, our ordering systems automatically update in real time based on what customers do actually buy, so that we can quickly and accurately supply stores with the right products at the right time. We plan our distribution processes, systems and network of DCs to maximise efficiency. Labour scheduling and transport planning systems enable our pickers and drivers to operate highly effectively, and we develop our distribution networks to minimise the mileage needed to get products to store in perfect condition. We also use transport other than lorries such as our four train services in the UK, which save 15,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. Continually striving to make every part of the process productive, through primary distribution, we use our network to pick products up from some of our suppliers and transport them to our depots, which can be more cost-effective than individual suppliers delivering to us. We also use return journeys from stores to depots to pick up waste materials which we sell for recycling. Sell: The best shopping trip Whether in store, online or a combination of both, we pride ourselves on delivering a great shopping trip for our customers, week in, week out. One of Tesco's Values is 'No one tries harder for customers', and this can be seen in how we strive to improve the shopping trip. This represents every element of the customer shopping experience, including price, range, quality, availability and service. Our loyalty schemes are key to the customer offering, thanking customers each time they shop at Tesco. We take a multi-format approach to our store network, to be able to meet our customers' needs for different types of shopping trip, from large Extra stores that offer a full range of food, general merchandise and services, to Metro and Express convenience stores. 'Selling' refers to a broader and broader range of activities as we develop our multi-channel offer. We launched a grocery home shopping service in the UK in 1997. Since then, we have grown this business to over PS2 billion of annual sales, launched grocery home shopping in South Korea, the Republic of Ireland and the Czech Republic, and launched further online businesses, such as Direct, Clothing and Entertainment. We are increasingly offering customers the option of combining stores and online with Click & Collect, which makes the most of our convenient store locations, giving customers an easy way to pick up products ordered online. We also offer a wide range of services to our customers. With opticians, pharmacies and phone shops available in our larger stores, and Tesco Bank products available to buy in store, over the phone or online, we are deepening our customers' relationship with Tesco, bringing our values of convenience, simplicity, reliability and great customer service into what can be complex markets. We don't always sell our products ourselves. In South Korea and the Czech Republic, we operate franchise chains alongside our own stores, and we have also recently announced a new franchise model for our F&F clothing brand in Saudi Arabia. The virtuous volume circle By keeping our customer focus central to our business model, we are able to provide a leading customer offer: a broad range of products and services at great prices, sold in shops in convenient locations and, increasingly, available online. A great customer offer drives the virtuous volume circle, which means that we can continuously improve our offer. By selling more products, we are able to work with our suppliers to drive mutually beneficial economies of scale, creating headroom to invest and to offer lower prices to customers. An important element of our Plan to improve business performance in the UK is centred on investing in the shopping trip so that customers will reward us by buying more from Tesco. Enablers Our core business model is supported by enablers which maximise the potential of our core activities to give our customers the best shopping trip and ensure that our activities are carried out in a sustainable way. Leveraging Group skill and scale: Making our business Better, Simpler, Cheaper, Faster Sharing best practice systems, processes and approaches across all of our markets takes our business model to the next level. By identifying best practice in each market, we can improve our offering around the Group. For example, some of the very popular brands we have developed in Fresh & Easy in the US have recently been introduced into the UK and South Korea. As our international experience grows, we are increasingly benefitting from sharing best practice - with our UK Operating Board all having spent some of their careers in our international businesses. Business model 26 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 Group skill and scale supports each of our core activities: utilising Insight, Buying, Moving and Selling. Utilising Insight as a Group, with a loyalty scheme in all of our markets, means we can continually innovate the customer offer. Our Turkish business launched Clubcard this year, which would not normally be possible for a business of its size. Buying as a Group is cost-effective, creating headroom to invest in the customer shopping trip, such as by sourcing consumables in Central Europe as a Group. Moving as a Group, with distribution centre blueprints, systems, and the early stages of borderless distribution, makes our deliveries simpler and faster, with new distribution centres opened in both Poland and China this year. Selling as a Group, with our Extra format already in eight international markets, including the Czech Republic, Thailand and China, offers customers a better shopping experience. Of course we don't believe in 'one size fits all'. There are many things that are best done locally because customer tastes and lifestyles are not uniform. Our businesses are run predominantly by local teams, not by expats, so that our operations can be close to the customers we serve, and our local ranges both support our smaller suppliers and give customers a tailored product offering. Developing our people: Our most important asset Great service can make a customer's day, and we achieve this when our people live the Tesco Values: 'No one tries harder for customers' and 'Treat people how we like to be treated'. Our business is built on the commitment of more than half a million people across the world and, in return for their commitment, we offer them good jobs and careers with Tesco. Developing our people takes many forms, from training in our state-of-the-art training academy in Asia, to offering jobs to the long-term unemployed through Regeneration Partnerships and supporting the development of women to management positions. Creating valuable property: The best located and best designed stores Our site research and property capabilities enable us to identify and develop the best sites for our stores. Tesco has great depth of experience in property development all around the world. Optimal sites for new store developments and extensions are identified by our site research departments. We have a flexible approach to property acquisition, considering both freehold and leasehold sites and assessing each opportunity on its merits. Using a range of data, such as demographics and competitor activity, we forecast sales for a new store to a high degree of accuracy, so that we can develop the stores with the greatest potential. Once a site has been identified, approved and secured, our property development and construction teams design and develop the site. Years of experience have fed into Group-wide blueprints and specifications so that all of our development takes place to the highest standard. In many of our international markets, Tesco owns or leases whole malls, which are anchored by a Tesco hypermarket. Operating the mall and renting out the space to other retailers, cafes and cinemas creates a great destination shopping centre for customers, as well as bringing in significant rental income, which makes Tesco one of the largest mall operators in the world. Operating responsibly: Ensuring that growth is sustainable By operating responsibly, we not only benefit and secure the future of our business but we can bring real benefits to the communities in which we operate. At the heart of our commitment to operating responsibly is providing our customers with good quality, safe and affordable food. This is easily taken for granted in developed economies, but can be a real challenge in economies with low penetration of modern retail and underdeveloped supply chains. We can only achieve this by working with our suppliers to ensure our supply chain is both resilient and efficient. Strong, fair, mutually beneficial, long-term partnerships with suppliers, from local to global, are at the heart of this. The strength of our supply network was evident during the Thai floods this year, enabling us to secure essential supplies from Malaysia and other markets. We are committed to the responsible sourcing of raw materials, ensuring the resilience of our supply chain and managing our impact on the environment. We work with the wider industry on core issues, such as water scarcity, and co-chair the Sustainability Steering Group of the Consumer Goods Forum, which has pledged to help end deforestation by 2020. We aim to be a zero-carbon business by 2050 and are mapping the biggest opportunities to cut carbon in our supply chain, as well as continually exploring new energy efficiency measures to be introduced across the Group. Innovating our offer: Constantly improving our customer offer To continue to meet customers' changing needs, we are constantly innovating our offer in a whole variety of ways. Innovation can bring greater convenience to an existing way of shopping, as with self-service checkouts. It can offer customers a new way of shopping, as with Click & Collect grocery or our virtual stores in South Korea. It can combine our presence in shops and online into a compelling customer proposition: for example, a customer registered with Blinkbox can automatically receive a digital copy of most new Hollywood releases when they buy the DVD with a Clubcard in store. By drawing on the breadth of our expertise and by always putting the customer first, we continue to serve customers how they want to be served in a changing and increasingly joined-up world. Building the Tesco Brand: To be seen as the most highly valued business in the world Through everything we do, we strive towards our vision of being seen as the most highly valued business in the world - valued not only by our customers, but also by the communities we serve, our staff and our shareholders. Protecting and developing our brand reputation is the foundation of customer loyalty and of how we are seen by our many stakeholders and enables our business model to operate effectively. For example, our diversification into services such as Tesco Bank is built on customers' trust in the Tesco brand to offer good value, simple solutions and great customer service: and our recruitment and retention of great staff depends on our reputation for customer service and offering good jobs and careers.

For example, five-year TSR for 11 12 is the annualised growth in the share price from 06 07 and dividends paid and reinvested in Tesco shares, as a percentage of the 06 07 share price. Performance Returns reduced reflecting the effect on our share price of our decision to invest significantly in the customer offer in the UK. Definition Capex is the investment in property, plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets. This is divided by Group sales inc. VAT, inc. petrol to show a relative investment to sales. Performance This year we reduced our rate of capital investment to reflect the challenging trading environment and increased our focus on lower capital-intensive investments with high returns, such as online and convenience. Last year we set a target of 5% to 5.5% of sales. We will reduce capex to PS3.3 billion in 12 13 and, beyond that, comfortably less than 5.0% of sales. 1.6% Growth in underlying profit before tax 08 09 09 10 10 11 11 12 9.8% 8.7% 12.3% 1.6% Definition Our underlying profit provides information on the underlying trend and performance of the business. It is adjusted for a number of non-cash accounting adjustments and one-off costs. Performance We saw modest progress in the year, with the rate of improvement impacted by two events: the Hungary crisis tax PS38 million and the increase in provision for Payment Protection Insurance 'PPI' in Tesco Bank PS57 million. Growth before these impacts was 5.4%. 14.6% 10 11 11 12 14 15 TARGET 12.9% 13.3% Return on Capital Employed 'ROCE' 13.3% Definition ROCE is a relative profit measurement that demonstrates the return the business is generating from its gross assets. Performance Although our UK performance was weaker than planned, ROCE improved by 40 basis points, benefiting from Japan now being classified as a discontinued operation. 1% Growth in underlying diluted earnings per share at a constant tax rate 08 09 09 10 10 11 11 12 11.0% 7.7% 10.8% 2.1% Definition Underlying diluted earnings per share 'EPS' is the amount of underlying profit, adjusted for the number of shares in issue. Performance The growth in underlying diluted EPS reflects modest progress in earnings in the year. The proposed full year dividend per share grew by 2.1%, in line with this, to 14.76p, continuing our unrivalled record of consecutive years of dividend growth in the FTSE 100.

In a challenging year for consumers in many of our markets, as they try to manage household budgets pressured by inflation, austerity and high fuel prices, we have made modest progress at a Group level. The international businesses performed strongly, delivering an 18% increase in profits, which helped to compensate for the reduction in trading profit in the UK. We have acted where our strategy was not delivering as we had hoped. In the United States, we reduced losses, moving towards break-even, before accelerating investment: in Japan, we announced our decision to exit the market after eight years: in China, we stepped back from the freehold shopping centre programme and have decided to hold back on the pace of new leasehold hypermarket development for the time being: at the Bank, we slowed down the migration to our own platforms to ensure it was as smooth as possible: and in the UK, we took a significant step to correct our pricing position with The Big Price Drop and, in January, acted decisively to address the underperformance in our home market. These actions will make Tesco better for our customers and are supported by a financial strategy that will also make Tesco better for shareholders.

In the UK we saw strong total sales growth driven by a good new store performance, but our like-for-like growth was disappointing, particularly in the second half of the year. This was not helped by reduced inflation resulting from our Big Price Drop and a weak Christmas, which was affected by the substantial increase in competitor couponing activity. Like-for-like sales growth recovered somewhat after Christmas.

The combined revenue and capital investment involved in these initiatives will exceed PS1 billion, supported by a significant reset to the level of UK margins in order to give us the financial resources we need to make comprehensive improvements for customers.

Our performance in Thailand was obviously impacted by the devastating floods but the business has returned to strong growth as the country gets back to normal. Asia margins grew by over 60 basis points in the year, mainly due to the swift resolution of our insurance claim in Thailand, which has mitigated the profit impact of store closures during the flooding. South Korea and Malaysia both had a good year for sales and margin growth, although this was offset by increased losses in China where, in common with other businesses, we faced a challenging year. 08 09 PS355m PS440m PS737m 09 10 11 12 Asia trading profit PS605m 10 11 Asia results from 2011 12 exclude results from our operation in Japan which have been treated as discontinued following our decision to sell the business. 2010 11 results have been re-presented to be consistent.

Despite a strong sales performance in Poland, profits were held back by significant disruption connected to the opening of our new distribution centre and a non-food stock write-off. The crisis tax of PS38 million in Hungary had a material impact on profits. Excluding this, we saw double-digit profit growth for the Central European businesses - a pleasing performance in light of the broader economic issues affecting the eurozone. Our Irish business delivered a robust performance in the context of the severity of the recession there. The particular circumstances of the Republic of Ireland and Hungary have led us to focus on driving trade from our existing stores and we have scaled back our investment in new space. Focusing our efforts on our existing stores has driven strengthening like-for-likes and continued increases in market share in both markets. 08 09 PS496m PS474m PS529m 09 10 11 12 Europe trading profit PS527m 10 11 United States US results 2011 12 Actual rates Constant rates 2011 12 Growth Growth US sales PS638m 27.1% 31.5% US revenue exc. impact of IFRIC 13 PS630m 27.3% 31.7% US trading profit loss PS 153 m Improved 17.7% Improved 15.1% In the US, Fresh & Easy delivered another strong sales performance and we have reduced losses by nearly 18% year-on-year - the first full-year reduction in losses since our entry into the market.

Thirty stores are already making a positive contribution to cashflow, and 118 more are very close to doing so. We intend to focus on delivering this store-level profitability, before pushing on faster with expansion in the number of stores. As a result of this more measured approach to new capital expenditure, we now anticipate crossing into break-even in the US during 2013 14.

This measures business growth, before key non-trading provisioning movements. This performance was particularly pleasing given the need to take a conservative approach on new savings and loans business during the final stages of systems migration. As we put more than three years of transition behind us, the Bank is well placed to deliver good growth, starting in the coming year. Trading profit was impacted by a number of factors. The unwind of the fair value provision, dating from the time of acquisition in 2008, reduced by PS133 million in the year, to PS22 million, and will be immaterial going forward. We increased our provision against possible claims arising from the sale of PPI by PS57 million in the first half of the year. With no further adjustments in the second half, we ended the year with a net provision of PS75 million. Our decision to slow down the final stages of migration also impacted profit by around PS40 million which will now begin to reverse. Bad debts reduced by 5.2% in the year due to the application of our robust credit policy. The Bank's overall capital position improved, from an already good position. Liquidity has also improved, with the retail bond issues giving us greater diversity in the Bank's funding position. Group balance sheet Net debt remained stable for the year at PS6.8 billion. This is a little behind our expectations at the half-year, due to the impact of the Christmas trading result on cash flow and to lower working capital inflow, linked to higher stock levels than planned. Group capital expenditure was slightly below our half-year expectation, at PS3.8 billion, due to tight control of spending. Operating cash flow from retail operations was down slightly year-on-year, at PS3.8 billion, again affected by lower working capital inflow. Our strategy to release value from our property portfolio has had another successful year, generating PS376 million of property profits from around PS1 billion of disposals. The launch of our first property fund in Asia completed successfully after the year end, raising over PS379 million from 17 mature stores and malls in Thailand. With the fund seeing strong demand on launch, and since trading above its listing price, this is a strong indication of the overall value of our operations in Thailand and elsewhere in Asia. The market value of our global property currently exceeds PS37 billion. Finally, our IAS 19, or accounting, pension deficit increased to PS1.4 billion after tax, largely as a consequence of market conditions. We announced proposed changes to the terms of our defined benefits scheme in March, in order to make it more sustainable over the long term. We also made a one-off cash contribution of PS180 million to the scheme after the year end, in anticipation of the forthcoming outcome of the triennial actuarial valuation, which we believe gives a more accurate indication of the likely costs of future funding of the scheme. Group financial metrics A year ago I set out four key financial metrics or measures to help investors monitor our capital returns performance, debt and overall balance sheet. Taking each in turn, we have improved return on capital employed 'ROCE' from 12.9% last year to 13.3%. This improvement benefits from Japan now being classified as discontinued as a result of our decision to exit the market. 10 11 12.9% 13.3% 11 12 13.3% 14.6% 14 15 TARGET T arget return on capital employed We held our two debt metrics, fixed charge cover and net indebtedness, broadly flat this year. Both measures will of course be directly affected by the UK investment plan we have announced for the coming year. Our target for fixed charge cover is between 4 and 4.5 times and, for net indebtedness, is 2.5 times. On our fourth key metric, capital expenditure as a proportion of sales, we were exactly in the middle of our target range of 5 to 5.5%. Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 35 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW Key performance indicators Financial review Looking forward Capital expenditure Our future plans include a reduced level of Group capital expenditure: down to PS3.3 billion in 2012 13 and, beyond that, comfortably less than 5% of sales. This reflects our movement into a new phase of growth for the Group, moving beyond the diversification and expansion phase, to a phase where the allocation of capital is based on the balance of growth and returns that each investment can deliver. Capital allocation Our plans lead to further significant changes in our capital allocation for the Group. Having already started some of this work in the UK, we are seeing higher returns on the new space that we have opened as a result. Across the Group more of our capital is going into smaller, higherreturning store formats. We will be investing less overall capital in our UK business, as we reduce the net new space opening programme by 38% in the coming year, and focus store openings on smaller stores, and on food more than non-food. Within the overall UK spend, we will be spending much more on the refresh of our existing stores, increasing our investment to over PS200 million, in addition to an increase in our online investment to around PS150 million. Capital work-in-progress The level of capital work-in-progress 'WIP' on the UK balance sheet now stands at around PS2 billion. Building out stores faster than we acquire new sites will be a key contributor to UK space growth over the next few years, and will reduce this level of WIP. The completion of mixed use schemes within the WIP balance will also play a significant role in bringing it down to a more appropriate level, although the construction phase on these schemes will add to the WIP balance in 2012 13, followed by a rapid reduction thereafter. In some instances, we may also dispose of standalone sites that do not meet our new, more rigorous returns hurdles. Cash This financial strategy means an increasingly cash generative outlook for Tesco in the next few years, with an overall reduction in Group capital expenditure, a return to growth in the cash contribution from the UK business, the international businesses making an increasingly positive contribution and a return to strong cash inflows from working capital. 08 09 PS708m PS611m PS66m 09 10 11 12 Cash inflows from decrease in retail working capital PS357m 10 11 average annual cash inflow from decrease in retail working capital 08 09 to 11 12 In line with our financial strategy, working capital management will result in a return to strong cash inflows from working capital in the coming years. Returns Capital restraint and improved cash generation both result in an improving ROCE. Last year, we laid out our commitment to improve ROCE to 14.6% by 2014 15. Our investment plans in the UK make it likely that we will see a small reduction in 2012 13. However, we described a number of significant opportunities to increase returns last year, such as driving growth in the Bank, benefiting from regional scale in Central Europe and moving the US to profitability, as well as the structural benefit of maturing international businesses. These opportunities still exist and indeed our decision to divest the Japanese business has already made a contribution. Our financial strategy of capital discipline and restraint supports a more sustainable level of growth, which focuses on getting more out of the businesses we currently have, benefits from less capital-intensive forms of investment and applies higher hurdle rates to new opportunities. This in turn drives higher returns and a higher level of cash generation. In supporting the plans that make Tesco better for customers, I believe this financial strategy is also better for shareholders.

The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group has an appropriate approach to risk management and internal control within the context of achieving the Group's objectives. Our process for identifying and managing risks is set out in more detail from page 60 of the Directors' report on corporate governance. The table below sets out the principal risks faced by the Group, their movement during the year and examples of relevant key controls and mitigating factors. The Board considers these to be the most significant risks and, whilst they are not directly comparable, they have been ranked in terms of relative importance to the Group at this time. They do not comprise all risks associated with the Group. Additional risks not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse effect on the business. The principal risks associated with operating Tesco Bank are considered separately in the section of the table below headed 'Tesco Bank Financial Services Risks'. Risk is an accepted part of doing business. The real challenge for any business is to identify the principal risks it faces and to develop and monitor appropriate controls.

The Bank's Board considers these to be the most significant risks but has not set them out in any order of priority. They do not comprise all risks associated with the Bank. Principal risks Change from 2010 11 Key controls and mitigating factors Transformation risk The Transformation Programme is a significant change programme designed to develop platforms and processes to enable the Bank to conduct banking and insurance business independently of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group 'RBS'. The key remaining component of the Transformation Programme is the migration of the credit card portfolio In addition, the Bank has well-developed plans for launching mortgages, subject to FSA approval There is strong programme governance in place with a tiered committee structure headed by the Bank's Executive-level Project Assessment Committee 'PAC' The Bank operates standard project management disciplines which are employed to deliver effective programme and risk and issue management Tesco Bank Financial Services Risks Tesco Bank 'the Bank' primarily operates in the UK retail financial services market offering savings products, unsecured consumer lending products and general insurance products as well as travel money and ATM services. The section below sets out principal risks relating specifically to the Bank. The Bank's Enterprise Wide Risk Management Framework identifies the main controls and actions. There are a number of key components of the framework common to all of the major risk categories, including the following: Component Description of the component Independent Risk function Reporting to the Chief Risk Officer 'CRO' and responsible for designing and implementing risk management frameworks and for independently monitoring the risk profile, providing oversight and challenge to the business Three lines of defence Line managers are responsible for establishing an effective control framework within their area of operations and for identifying and controlling all risks within risk appetite and policy limits first line of defence. The second line of defence is the independent Risk function. Internal Audit is the third line of defence and is responsible for the independent assessment of the effectiveness of the implementation of the overall risk and control measures Policy framework Risk is responsible for the policy framework, with the Bank's policy documents providing the rules and guiding principles that define the approach to specific subjects and covering all aspects of risk Integrated risk reporting Reporting is provided monthly to senior governance committees. Exposures are monitored against triggers and limits on a daily, weekly or monthly frequency as required. Exceptions are reported monthly to the Bank's Asset & Liability Management Committee 'ALCO', the Risk Management Committee 'RMC' and to each meeting of Board Risk Committee 'BRC' Stress testing Stress testing is the process under which the Bank's business plans, capital and liquidity are subjected to severe adverse impacts. Stress testing is a mandatory requirement of the FSA who require that banks implement their own stress testing processes. Stress testing is essential to effective risk management and is a key component of the Bank's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 'ICAAP' and Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment 'ILAA' processes 44 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 Principal risks Change from 2010 11 Key controls and mitigating factors Credit risk - external environment The downside risks to the UK economy remain high, including fragile consumer confidence, a squeezing of real incomes, increasing unemployment and some consumers increasing borrowing and switching to variable rate mortgages On the wider economic front subdued UK growth, continued fiscal austerity and the continuing eurozone debt crisis is impacting confidence and may impact the ability to sustain debt servicing and repayment in the event of an economic shock The Bank's credit risk appetite is based on lending responsibly to manage the credit risk profile of its portfolio within agreed parameters Credit portfolios continue to be closely monitored with changes made to acquisition and limit management strategies to mitigate, as far as possible, downside economic risks The Bank has minimal direct exposure to non-UK sovereigns and proactively monitors and manages the non-retail portfolios to reduce exposure to specific names or geographies Legal and regulatory compliance risk Legal and regulatory compliance risk is the risk of consequences arising as a result of non-compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the Bank's governance, prudential arrangements, business activities, risk management and its conduct with customers Conduct risk There remains significant regulatory focus in relation to 'Conduct risk' or 'Treating Customers Fairly'. Specifically there has been continued industry-wide focus on provision of redress in relation to past sales of Payment Protection Insurance 'PPI' The Bank's aim is to meet all legal and regulatory requirements by maintaining an effective control framework A dedicated risk team is responsible for the identification of regulatory risks, the management and oversight of policies and processes and the provision of assurance in relation to regulatory risk and compliance The Bank's Treating Customers Fairly Board and the Bank's Board reviews and challenges delivery of fair outcomes for customers A programme to proactively remediate disadvantaged PPI customers has commenced Insurance risk The Bank defines insurance risk as the risk we accept through our insurance products in return for a premium. These risks may or may not occur as expected and the amount and timing of these risks are uncertain and determined by events outside of our control The Bank is exposed to insurance risks through its historic distribution arrangement with RBS, which is expected to terminate in quarter four of 2012, and through its ownership of 49.9% of Tesco Underwriting Limited 'TU' The Bank's aim is to actively manage insurance risk exposure with particular focus on those risks that impact profit volatility Regular, independent reviews of reserves are undertaken with reporting to the Bank's RMC, Audit Committee, BRC and Board The Bank uses reinsurance to limit exposure above pre-determined limits Risk appetite and a suite of risk policies are in place to manage risk in TU The Bank's Insurance Risk function provides independent oversight of TU which is appropriate to the Bank's role as key shareholder Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 45 STRATEGIC REVIEW PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW General information Directors' remuneration report Board of Directors Principal risks and uncertainties Corporate governance Principal risks and uncertainties Principal risks Change from 2010 11 Key controls and mitigating factors Funding liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank has insufficient cash resources to meet its obligations as they fall due or can do so only at excessive cost Funding risk is the risk that the Bank does not have sufficiently stable and diverse sources of funding or the funding structure is inefficient External market conditions continue to exhibit signs of stress with wholesale funding markets constrained and significant competition for retail deposits The Group relies on significant amounts of on demand retail funding The Bank aims to have a conservative Balance Sheet structure with prudent risk appetite supported by explicit targets and metrics which enable it to meet its financial obligations, including under stressed conditions The Bank holds a significant and diversified stock of highly marketable liquid assets, in excess of internal and regulatory requirements The Bank's significant retail deposit base means that there is currently less reliance on wholesale markets as a source of funding and historic practice indicates that such deposits tend to be relatively stable Operational risk Operational risk is the potential error, loss, harm or failure caused by ineffective or inadequately defined processes, system failure, improper conduct, human error or from external events Outsourcing risk A significant number of services and processes are provided by third party service providers and a key operational risk is the failure of an outsourced service provider People risk Increased market demand for specialist personnel could result in increased costs of recruitment and retention or reduced organisational effectiveness if a sufficient number of skilled staff cannot be employed The Bank's aim is to minimise all operational risks and reputational impacts A Risk and Control Self Assessment process is used by the business to identify, assess, quantify, monitor and report its operational risks and management's effectiveness in mitigating them. Regular reporting is provided to RMC and remedial actions taken as required The Procurement policy provides consistent and robust standards for supplier sourcing and selection The Bank's Strategic Relationship Management process enables the monitoring of the performance of third-party outsourcers and suppliers against agreed service level agreements, the management of the relationships and the improvement of supply or termination of contract where appropriate The Bank's People Matters Group, an Executive committee of the Bank, oversees key aspects of people risk, including talent management, performance management, retention and succession planning Market risk Market risk is defined as the risk that the value of the Bank's assets, liabilities, income or costs might vary due to changes in the value of financial market prices: this includes interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads and equities The Bank has no trading book There is low appetite for exposure to interest rate risk in the banking book 'IRRBB' and other market risks, such as credit spreads, which are monitored and reported through ALCO and RMC 46 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 Financial risks review The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and credit risks relating to the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions. The management of these risks is set out below. Details of the main financial risks relating to Tesco Bank and the management of those risks can be found in the principal risks and uncertainties table above and in Note 22 to the financial statements on page 126. Funding and liquidity The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, disposals of property assets, longand medium-term debt capital market issues, short-term commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases. The objective is to ensure continuity of funding. The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities and a strong credit rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. Tesco Group has a long-term rating of Astable from Fitch, Baa1 stable from Moody's and Astable from Standard & Poor's. New funding of PS2.5 billion was arranged during the year, including a net PS1.1 billion from property disposals and PS1.4 billion from long-term debt. At the year end, net debt was PS6.8 billion 2011: PS6.8 billion. Interest rate risk management Our objective is to limit our profit and loss downside from rising interest rates. Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and floors are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Our policy is to fix interest rates for the year on a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs of the Group excluding Tesco Bank. At the year end the percentage of interest bearing debt at fixed rates was 90% 2011: 71%. The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate form. The average rate of interest paid on an historic cost basis this year, excluding joint ventures and associates, was 4.8% 2011: 5.4%. Foreign currency risk management Our principal objective is to reduce the effect of exchange rate volatility on operating margins. Transactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are managed, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies and purchased currency options. At the year end, forward foreign currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to PS1,944 million were outstanding 2011: PS1,615 million as detailed in Note 21. We translate overseas profits at average foreign exchange rates which we do not currently further manage. We only hedge a proportion of the investment in our international subsidiaries as well as ensuring that each subsidiary is appropriately hedged in respect of its non-functional currency assets. During the year, currency movements decreased the net value, after the effects of hedging, of the Group's overseas assets by PS22 million last year decrease of PS344 million. Credit risk The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions across an approved list of counterparties of good credit quality. The Group's positions with these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored. Insurance We purchased assets, earnings and combined liability protection from the open insurance market for higher value losses only. The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the business with some cover being provided by our captive insurance companies, ELH Insurance Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the Republic of Ireland. ELH Insurance Limited covers Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability, while Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability only.

      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE": "- The company's **Return on Equity (ROE)** has shown a slight improvement from approximately **15.94%** in the previous year to about **16.06%** in the current year, indicating enhanced profitability relative to shareholders' equity.\n- This positive trend suggests the company is generating more net income from the equity invested by shareholders, which is generally favorable for investors.\n- The **annual report highlights operational improvements**, such as strong profit growth, improved working capital management, and greater capital efficiency partly due to a **sale and leaseback programme**, as key drivers contributing to the increase in ROE.\n- Additionally, the company\u2019s focus on expanding **return on capital employed (ROCE)** and enhancing **profit margins** supports sustainable improvements in overall equity returns.\n- The **diversification strategy across international markets** and growth in retail services also underpin the profitable use of equity capital, helping to maintain or potentially improve ROE.\n- The reported increase in **dividends by 10.8%** aligns with the growth in underlying earnings per share, reinforcing positive shareholder returns.\n- Given the company\u2019s strategic focus on expanding profitable businesses in the UK and internationally, combined with ongoing efficiency initiatives, the current ROE trend is likely to continue over the next quarter.\n- Over the next year, growth in emerging markets and retail services, alongside operational efficiencies, should sustain or enhance ROE further, benefiting shareholders.\n- However, investors should remain cautious of external risks such as economic conditions and competitive pressures that could impact profitability and equity returns.\n- Overall, the modest but consistent improvement in ROE reflects strong management execution and bodes well for **future shareholder value creation**.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE Driver": "- The **Asset Turnover** ratio improved from 4.84 to 5.13, indicating the company is generating more sales per unit of assets, reflecting enhanced **asset efficiency**.\n- The increase in Asset Turnover suggests better utilization of assets, likely driven by expansion in store space and growth in sales, consistent with the report's mention of opening new stores and expanding formats.\n- The **Profit Margin** rose from 4.09% to 4.36%, showing improved **profitability** per unit of sales.\n- Margin improvement aligns with the report's highlights on cost control, product mix enhancement (notably through premium own-brand lines), and operational efficiencies.\n- Both drivers are **strengthening**, contributing positively to ROE and indicating improved **investor value creation**.\n- The rise in Asset Turnover appears slightly more pronounced percentage-wise, suggesting **asset efficiency** is the dominant contributor to ROE improvement.\n- The report\u2019s focus on expanding international markets and online channels supports expectations of continued asset turnover growth.\n- Profit margin improvement is supported by strategic pricing, value brand initiatives, and controlled operating expenses, implying steady margin growth.\n- Near-term trends suggest sustained asset efficiency with ongoing store openings and digital expansion; profitability is expected to improve moderately as cost efficiencies and service innovations mature.\n- Overall, the company demonstrates a healthy balance between growing sales efficiently and maintaining profitability, reinforcing positive **return on equity** prospects.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of Risk": "- The company's **gearing ratio decreased** from 1.90 to 1.66, indicating a **reduction in financial leverage** and potentially lower financial risk.\n- The **current ratio and quick ratio both declined** (from 0.73 to 0.67 and 0.27 to 0.17, respectively), signaling a **deterioration in short-term liquidity** and a possible strain on the company's ability to meet immediate obligations.\n- **NLP-derived financial, legal, and tax risk scores all increased**, reflecting a **heightened perception of risk** in these areas compared to the prior year.\n- The **financial risk score almost doubled** (0.54 to 1.06), highlighting growing concerns around the company's financial stability or exposure.\n- Conversely, **NLP specificity slightly decreased** (0.087 to 0.086), suggesting a **marginal decline in the precision of risk disclosures**.\n- **Sentence length increased slightly** from 27.02 to 27.40 words, while **sentence depth decreased** from 6.49 to 6.38, indicating a shift towards **slightly longer but less syntactically complex sentences**.\n- This linguistic change may reflect a **trade-off between complexity and accessibility**; slightly longer sentences might reduce clarity, but reduced depth can ease comprehension, resulting in **mixed effects on transparency**.\n- The company's **risk narrative remains comprehensive**, covering strategic, operational, regulatory, and financial risks, but the **increased risk scores and liquidity concerns warrant investor caution**.\n- The **reduction in leverage is a positive sign**, but **weakened liquidity ratios and rising legal and tax risks** could signal emerging challenges.\n- Going forward, **risks related to regulatory changes, economic conditions, and operational execution may intensify**, necessitating close monitoring by investors.",
      "summary": "- The company's **Return on Equity (ROE)** improved slightly from **15.94% to 16.06%**, reflecting enhanced **profitability** and efficient use of **shareholders' equity**.  \n- Key drivers include increased **Asset Turnover** (4.84 to 5.13), indicating better **asset efficiency**, and a higher **Profit Margin** (4.09% to 4.36%), showing improved **cost control** and **product mix**.  \n- Operational improvements, such as **working capital management** and a **sale and leaseback programme**, have contributed to greater **capital efficiency**.  \n- The company's focus on expanding **return on capital employed (ROCE)** and growing **retail and international markets** supports sustainable ROE growth.  \n- A **10.8% increase in dividends** aligns with earnings growth, reinforcing positive **shareholder returns**.  \n- Financial risk concerns have increased, with the **gearing ratio decreasing** from 1.90 to 1.66 (lower leverage) but **liquidity ratios weakening** (current ratio from 0.73 to 0.67; quick ratio from 0.27 to 0.17).  \n- NLP-derived **financial, legal, and tax risk scores** have risen, indicating heightened perceived risks that warrant investor caution.  \n- Changes in reporting show slightly longer but less complex sentences, suggesting a balance between **transparency and accessibility**, though with a marginal decline in disclosure precision.  \n- Overall, the company demonstrates strong **management execution** and a balanced approach to growth and profitability, though **liquidity pressures** and elevated risk scores require monitoring.  \n- The outlook remains positive for continued ROE improvement supported by operational efficiency and market expansion, tempered by external economic and regulatory risks."

Laurie McIlwee has taken on responsibility for Group Strategy in addition to his role as CFO. Andrew Higginson and Lucy Neville-Rolfe will continue in their roles as CEO Retail Services and Executive Director Corporate and Legal Affairs respectively. There have also been a few changes to the Non-executive members of the Board this year. Rodney Chase CBE retired from his position as Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director in July. Patrick Cescau, who has served on the Board since February 2009, has replaced Rodney as Senior Independent Director. Charles Allen CBE and Dr Harald Einsmann, who had both served on the Tesco Board since February 1999, also retired in July and were replaced by Stuart Chambers and Gareth Bullock. Stuart, formerly CEO of NSG Group and Pilkington plc, has replaced Charles as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. Gareth, former Group Executive Director of Standard Chartered PLC, has joined the Audit Committee. I would like to thank Charles, Harald and Rodney for their excellent advice and important contributions over a combined 30 years' service, and also formally welcome Gareth and Stuart, who bring with them a wealth of international experience and new expertise in financial services, further adding to the overall strength of the Tesco Board. Dividend I am delighted to report that we have again increased our dividend - for the 27th consecutive year. The Board has proposed a final dividend of 10.09p per share, taking the full-year dividend to 14.46p. This represents an increase of 10.8% on last year's full-year dividend, which is in line with the growth in underlying diluted earnings per share at constant tax rates. Community This year, we donated over PS64 million to charity - again meeting our target to donate the equivalent of over 1% of our profits to charities and good causes. We'five made further progress towards our goal of becoming a zero-carbon business by 2050. This year we have reduced emissions from our baseline portfolio of buildings by 7.7%. Our people Our growth over the past year is a direct result of the dedication, passion and hard work of our people - a team which is now over 492,000 strong. I'm delighted that our share ownership incentive schemes are helping our staff to get their own personal stake in the business. This year 216,000 employees shared a record PS105.5 million through our Shares In Success scheme. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our people for their ongoing commitment to providing the best possible service for our customers. David Reid Chairman I am pleased to report another good set of results in what has been a challenging year in some of our markets. After 14 years as CEO, Terry Leahy announced his retirement in June and, as part of our long-term succession plan, Philip Clarke replaced him at the helm in March 2011. Terry is undoubtedly one of the leading businessmen of his generation. Under his leadership we have more than quadrupled our sales and profits, expanded into 13 countries outside the UK and entered new markets such as online retailing and financial services. On behalf of everyone at Tesco and all our shareholders, it is a privilege to thank Terry for his unrivalled contribution to the success of the business. There could be no better person to lead us going forward than Philip Clarke. Philip has worked at Tesco throughout his career, spending many years in Retail and Commercial. He joined the Tesco Board in 1998 and, as part of his role as Asia, Europe and IT Director, has been at the heart of many of our most important developments and operational improvements in recent years, such as entry into China, Turkey and India and the introduction of the Tesco Hindustan Service Centre HSC - our global services arm. I set the Nominations Committee the objective of delivering a seamless succession and I am delighted with the outcome. The handover process from Terry to Philip was very smooth. I have every confidence that under Philip's leadership, Tesco will go on to achieve even greater success in the future. In order for the Tesco Board to better reflect the global nature of our business, provide more focus on key areas of performance and deliver on our immediate objectives, we made additional changes in March 2011. Tim Mason has become Deputy CEO and Chief Marketing Officer in addition to his role as President and CEO Fresh & Easy. TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 3 OVERVIEW Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Chairman's statement Building on our success I'm pleased to report that Tesco has once again achieved a good set of results with good sales, profit and earnings per share growth, despite challenging conditions in some of our markets. I am particularly pleased with our progress on return on capital, where we have seen ROCE grow strongly to 12.9%, representing an important first step towards our 2014 15 target of 14.6%, with further increases to come. In the UK, we have an outstanding core business. It made progress in the year but some aspects of our performance can improve. Stronger sales momentum here is a key priority and I am confident that the focus and energy our new UK leadership team is bringing to the business will see a return to form in the months ahead as Tesco tries to do its bit to help customers who face pressure on their household budgets. The increasing scale and competitiveness of our international businesses are now driving strong growth in sales, market share, profits and returns, supported by the generally improving global economic environment. We have built some excellent springboards for future growth, and whilst there is still work to do, particularly in the United States, I am delighted with our performance in Europe and Asia, where I expect further strong growth this year and beyond. We have set six immediate team objectives against which we intend to be judged. First, keeping the UK strong and growing: second, we want to be outstanding internationally, not just successful: third, as the combination of stores and online becomes compelling for customers, we aim to become a multi-channel retailer wherever we trade: fourth, we will deliver on the potential of retailing services - of which Tesco Bank is a big part: fifth, by applying Group skill and scale we will give our customers even more value and increase the competitive advantage to our businesses: and finally, to deliver higher returns on capital employed for shareholders. Also, as part of our commitment to communities, we want to widen our contribution from tackling climate change to broader aspects of sustainability. Vision and strategy Tesco is a business built around customers and staff, high-quality assets around the world and multiple opportunities for growth. My job is to build on this legacy - for all our stakeholders. Going forward, there will mostly be continuity. We have a sound strategy, a strong team and the period of highest risk with the diversification of the business is now behind us. However, there will also be some changes, because we know that we can do some things better and because, as customers change, so must Tesco. Importantly, there will be no change to the foundations of our business: our core purpose - to create value for customers to earn their lifetime loyalty - and our Values - no one tries harder for customers and treat people how we like to be treated. I have set out a new vision for the future of the business. I would like Tesco to be seen as the most highly valued business in the world. Valued not only by our customers, but also by the communities we serve, our staff and our shareholders. We will win locally by applying our skills globally. The key word here is 'locally'. Seven years of running our businesses in Asia and Europe has taught me that all retailing is local. But increasingly we are utilising the skill and scale of the Group to benefit the performance and competitiveness of each of our businesses around the world. I have inherited a great legacy and I am really excited about the future. In the end of course, we know it's all about performance: that's what matters and that's what we aim to deliver. 4 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 OVERVIEW Chief Executive's review We will be a modern and innovative company. We'll stay ahead of the curve, anticipating changes and adapting for the sake of our customers and staff. We are, and we will remain a growth company. We will continue to pursue growth in all parts of the business - in the UK, internationally, in services and across general merchandise, clothing and electricals. More detail on our new vision can be found on pages 6 to 13. To put this vision into practice, our strategy is evolving - with a slight change in emphasis which builds on the success of our previous five-part strategy that has served us so well over the past 14 years. So our strategy will now have seven parts. Much of it will be familiar but with some important new additions around being a multi-channel retailer, creating highly valued brands and building our team: To grow the UK core To be an outstanding international retailer in stores and online To be as strong in everything we sell as we are in food To grow retail services in all our markets To put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do To be a creator of highly valued brands To build our team so that we create more value More details on our strategy can be found on page 14. Management structures We'five made some changes to our management structures in order to equip the business to deliver our strategy and vision. This means CEOs for each of our main areas of focus - the UK, Asia, Services including Tesco Bank, Europe and the US - being supported by the integrating functions such as IT and Finance to leverage the skill and scale of the Group. The biggest part of this change was in the UK, which now has its own CEO and management board for the first time. This will bring more focus and energy to our largest business. Of course, structures don't manage companies, people do and I'm confident that at all levels we have the very best team working hard to deliver the best shopping trip for our customers. Philip Clarke Group Chief Executive TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 5 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements T o be the most highly valued MOST HIGHL Y VALUED BY: TO BE THE MOST HIGHLY VALUED BY: The customers we serve Our core purpose is to create value for customers to earn their lifetime loyalty. This objective sits right at the heart of our business as one part of our Values - 'No one tries harder for customers'. We know that we are already valued by our customers across our markets. In the UK, for example, we have the most loyal customer base of the major grocery retailers and in South Korea, Homeplus was awarded South Korea's Most Admired Company award in October 2010. The communities in which we operate For Tesco to be considered a force for good, we must be a good neighbour and a responsible member of society. This is why Community is part of our balanced scorecard approach to running our business - and why each market has its own Community Plan, with promises relating to the environment, communities, responsible sourcing, healthy living and jobs and careers. Our loyal and committed staff We know that if we look after our staff, they will look after our customers. Work can be a large part of our lives so our people deserve an employer who cares. That's why one of our Values is 'Treat people how we like to be treated'. We are committed to providing opportunities for our people to get on and turn their jobs into careers, and across all of our markets we offer a wide range of competitive benefits. In the US, for example, we pay at least 75% of medical, dental, prescription and vision costs. 69% of employees across the Group who completed our annual staff survey said that they find their work interesting. Our shareholders As the owners of the business, it's crucial that our shareholders value Tesco highly. Shareholders want a good return on their investment and that's what we will continue to deliver for them. We have over 200,000 shareholders, including a large number of pension funds. We offer sustainable, profitable growth from a combination of a strong core UK business and exposure to rapidly growing emerging markets. Over the past decade our total shareholder return TSR has outperformed the FTSE 100 by 53.2% and we'five delivered dividend growth for the past 27 years - the longest record of consecutive increase by any FTSE 100 company. 69% of employees across the Group who completed our annual staff survey said that they find their work interesting OUR VISION survey said that they find their work inte of wh sta th T o learn more about our vision and strategy: http: ar2011. com businessreview ourstrategy TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 7 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Tesco Clubcard All retailing is local. And Clubcard is one of the ways in which we can be responsive to local customer needs. In addition to rewarding customers for their loyalty, Clubcard provides us with insight from millions of customer transactions. From this we can develop tailored ranges, promotions and marketing by country or region - in fact right down to the individual customer via their Clubcard mailing. The knowledge and expertise of operating Clubcard was developed in the UK but has now been rolled out to a further 11 countries across the Group, with more members in Asia and Europe than at home in the UK. F&F We'five been successful at exporting a number of our brands internationally, tailoring them to local trends, needs and price ranges. F&F is a good example of how one of our brands has spread globally and won locally. We're bringing the benefits of our Group skill and scale to our buying and sourcing operations, helping to reduce costs and improve quality. In Central Europe for example, 95% of our clothing supplier base is the same as Ireland and the UK, even though to win in each market, we adapt our range to local trends, tastes and climates. F&F is now in ten of our markets and is the market-leading clothing brand in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. We also opened our first stand-alone F&F store in Prague this year. World-class training for national talent We know that to be a successful international retailer we need to combine deep local knowledge with global experience - this is why all of our international management teams are a mixture of nationals and people from our UK business. In addition, the experience of working internationally helps us attract, retain and develop our people - over a fifth of our directors are currently working outside their home country. Our Academy supports the development of both operational expertise and leadership excellence. Management courses are developed based on global best practice and then used to train teams in each local market. Our first dedicated Academy centre will open in Seoul - serving Asia - in July. OUR VISION T o learn more about our vision and strategy: http: ar2011. com businessreview ourstrategy TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 9 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Online retailing Customers expect to be able to shop where and when they want - as shopping habits have changed over the years we'five changed too. As we'five grown from a UK supermarket chain towards becoming an international multi-channel retailer we'five continued to innovate every step of the way. We were viewed as pioneers when we first launched an online grocery business 11 years ago. It's now the largest, most profitable business of its kind in the world. Using their smartphones, our customers can now scan the barcode of grocery items, order online and have their shopping delivered to their home. A leader in green retailing As a global business we know that we can make a real difference in tackling climate change - cutting our own emissions, working with suppliers and helping customers to cut their carbon footprint. We also understand that successful businesses need to be green to grow. Our 2050 target to be a zero-carbon business will be achieved through improved efficiency and by generating our energy from renewable sources. We're making good progress - over the past year we have reduced emissions from our baseline portfolio of buildings by 7.7%. We have pledged to help customers cut their carbon footprints by 50% by 2020. We have worked with the Carbon Trust and other stakeholders to develop a universal carbon footprint label which describes the emissions associated with each product. Since January 2008, we have carbon labelled more than 500 everyday products in the UK and have started to label products in South Korea, helping our customers to make greener choices. 500 Products carbon labelled since 2008 OUR VISION T o learn more about our vision and strategy: http: ar2011. com businessreview ourstrategy TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 11 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Business review UK: an outstanding business We have more than doubled sales and profit in our UK business over the last decade, cementing our position as clear market leader. Yet there remain significant opportunities for further growth. The UK has the lowest grocery retail space per capita of any country in the EU: only 54% of shoppers are able to reach a Tesco Extra within 15 minutes and we have only a small share of the convenience sector. Beyond grocery we'five developed a strong position in many other categories such as clothing, electricals and entertainment. But with a market share of around 4% in the non-food sector there is still plenty more to come. 12 4% UK sales growth over the last decade International growth More than two-thirds of our profit growth now comes from markets outside the UK. We opened our first international Tesco store in 1995: today we're in 13 markets across Europe, Asia and North America. 65% of our floorspace is now outside the UK, and our businesses in Asia and Europe are collectively the same size as the whole of Tesco was 11 years ago. We'five built successful, diverse businesses across the world, yet the journey is only just beginning. We'five already developed market-leading, highly profitable businesses in a number of countries. In South Korea, our largest international business, Homeplus, already generates PS5 billion revenue. Yet, if Homeplus were to grow to have the same proportion of the total retail market that Tesco has achieved in the UK, the business would be more than three times as large as it is today. During our first decade of international expansion we'five proved that we are able to develop profitable and market-leading businesses in many of our markets. Over the next decade, in addition to further expanding our established overseas businesses, we are focused on delivering growth in three of the world's largest economies: China, India and the United States, which between them offer decades of future growth. New services Customers trust Tesco and appreciate that we provide value, simplicity and good service. This is our approach with everything we sell and is the key to our success in following the customer into new areas such as banking and telecoms. Tesco Bank in the UK now has over 6.5 million customer accounts and generates annual profits of PS264 million. We'five made particularly good progress in credit cards. In February, one in eight of all MasterCard and Visa credit card transactions in the UK were made on a Tesco credit card. As we broaden our offer - with mortgages launching this year - we aim to become the best choice for all our customers' banking needs. We have also established a successful Telecoms business. Tesco Mobile now has over 2.5 million customers. By focusing on value and good service and through our 194 Phone Shops we are changing the way that customers buy phones, services and accessories. com businessreview ourstrategy TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 13 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements The business review analyses the performance of the Tesco Group in the financial year ended 26 February 2011. It also explains other aspects of the Group's markets, results and operations, including strategy and risk management. The Directors present their Annual Report to shareholders on the affairs of the Group and Company, together with the audited financial statements of the Company for the 52 weeks ended 26 February 2011. Some elements of the strategy remain unchanged. The goal 'to grow the core UK business' is as relevant today as it was in 1997. The UK is the largest business in the Group and a key driver of sales and profit. There are many opportunities for further growth and so we will continue to grow the UK core. Another of our original goals was to be a 'successful international retailer'. In 1997, our international businesses generated 1.8% of the Group's profits. Today they represent 25% and we're now either number one or number two in eight of our 13 markets outside the UK. So we're already 'successful'. Our next step is to be an outstanding international retailer in stores and online. In 1997, we were largely a food retailer so we set ourselves the challenge of becoming 'as strong in non-food as in food'. As our business has grown and we offer an ever wider variety of products to customers, the term non-food no longer does justice to all the products and services we sell. We now aim to be as strong in everything we sell as we are in food. Our services businesses have come a long way since we first included in our strategy the desire 'to develop retailing services'. Today these parts of Tesco generate PS583 million profit, representing 16% of the Group total. To date this has been largely UK-focused, but as many of our international businesses have now established well-known brands in their local market, it is time to expand our ambitions and aim to grow retail services in all our markets. In 2007, we added a fifth element to our strategy to underpin our commitment to communities and the environment. We'five updated this objective slightly by emphasising our responsibilities in these areas. Our goal is to put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do. There are two new strategic goals, both of which reflect the way that Tesco has developed over the last decade and our areas of emphasis for the future. The first is to be a creator of highly valued brands. Our brand has evolved from a logo above a few stores in the UK to a multitude of store, product and service brands across the world. Building brands gives our business more meaning with our customers. On one level, this relates to our Retail brands such as the Tesco brand itself, but it also refers to our Product brands such as F&F and Technika and our Pillar brands such as Finest and Value. Our final goal is to build our team so that we create more value. As our business continues to grow and diversify we need more leaders to run the many substantial business and support functions within the Group. Our leaders not only have an important role today, but also have a responsibility to help build a bigger and better team for the future. Our progress in these areas is reviewed over the following pages. Business review Our strategy In 1997, Tesco set out a strategy to grow the core business and diversify with new products and services in existing and new markets. This strategy enabled us to deliver strong, sustained growth over the past 14 years. We'five followed customers into large expanding markets in the UK - such as financial services, general merchandise and telecoms - and new markets abroad, initially in Europe and Asia and more recently in the United States. In order to reflect changing consumer needs and the increasingly global nature of our business we'five evolved our strategy. The strategy now has seven parts and applies to our five business segments - the UK, Asia, Europe, the United States and Tesco Bank. 14 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Our business Our sevenpart strategy T o grow the UK core 16 22 T o be an outstanding international retailer in stores and online 26 T o be as strong in everything we sell as we are in food 30 T o grow retail services in all our markets 34 T o put our responsibilities to the communities we serve at the heart of what we do 38 T o be a creator of highly valued brands 42 T o build our team so that we create more value TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 15 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements T o grow the UK core In our market-leading UK business, we have delivered a solid performance by keeping our focus on the customer, providing them with great value, choice and service. Clubcard Clubcard is our unique customer loyalty programme - our way of saying 'thank you' to our customers. It is now more popular than ever before, with active membership of over 15 million customers, compared to 13 million at the start of 2008 9. Customers who say they would prefer a Tesco to open in their area rather than a competitor store cite Clubcard as the main reason. Clubcard continues to be a significant driver of growth for our business and ensures that our customer base continues to demonstrate considerably higher levels of loyalty than our competitors. For most of 2010, Clubcard was the number one reason behind customers switching to us for their weekly shop. Customers have responded well to our new and up-weighted Clubcard initiatives. Three million customers participated in the Big Clubcard Voucher Exchange promotions held in August and November, which provided new ways to get more value from vouchers through categoryspecific deals. We have seen 60% growth in Rewards through our Partner Reward Scheme as customers recognise that Clubcard is about more than just earning money-off vouchers and that they can use points as currency in other areas of their lives. 1% Trading margin 3.8% Trading profit up 5.5% Sales up Introduction and market context The UK economy is in recovery but consumers have been under pressure this year due to a combination of high petrol prices, food and utility inflation and, more recently, the VAT increase. As a result, we're experiencing a period of unusually subdued industry growth. Excluding petrol, like-for-like growth in the industry has been significantly lower than last year. Against this backdrop, our UK business has delivered a solid performance. Total UK sales were PS44.6 billion, growing by 5.5%, which was ahead of the market. UK trading profit increased by 3.8% or by 6.4% before the effects of our sale and leaseback programme: principally the additional rents incurred. 16 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Growing the UK core No. 1 reason for customers switching to T esco CLUBCARD Clubcard continues to play an important role in earning customers' loyalty. We'five continued to invest in Double Points, we have introduced the Big Clubcard Voucher Exchange and we have expanded our Partner Reward Scheme. TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 17 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements REAL FOOD This year, we launched the Tesco Real food magazine. The monthly publication, which is available for free in our stores, provides customers with recipes, cooking tips, information on healthy eating and updates on new Tesco products. The magazine has become Britain's largest food title with a circulation of 1.2 million. Real food can be found online at www. With over 1,000 recipes and a food blog, the site gets 2.2 million page views per month. We'five also launched an innovative service for customers to receive great recipes via SMS. Customers are able to send a text message including two or three key ingredients and in return receive an automatic reply with a delicious recipe suggestion. 2,000 Over 2,000 new and improved products 1 0m Self-service transactions per week Stores New space has continued to drive sales growth. We'five opened over 200 new stores in 2010 11 and have a strong opening programme for the coming year. We have seen particularly strong growth in our convenience format, Tesco Express, with over 150 new stores and have achieved significant share gain in the convenience sector. This growth follows our work to tailor the range and promotions in Express to better suit the needs of our customers locally. Overall last year, we had 80 million more customer visits to our Express stores than in 2009 10. We have also refreshed or extended over 400 stores this year, receiving a great response from customers. For example, we'five added 7,000 sq ft to Wembley Extra, expanding our World Foods offer to meet better the needs of customers in the local area - the store is outperforming by 16% and over three-quarters of customers have told us that it is greatly improved. Range Our customers tell us that quality is increasingly important to them, it is not simply about finding the cheapest product. We have stepped up our emphasis on quality, with accelerated product development, leading to the introduction of over 2,000 new and improved food products. The increasing importance of quality for customers is also supported by the strong performance of our Finest range, which has outpaced the growth of other areas of our food range, with a 6.3% increase in sales this year. Many of our customers want to buy locally sourced products to support their local communities. We are always looking to expand our network of good local suppliers and to support them in building capacity to grow their businesses and supply us at a national level. We have five dedicated regional buying offices throughout the UK and in 2010 11 we increased sales of local products to PS1 billion, up from PS850 million in 2009 10. Tesco is the first UK retailer to launch a website dedicated to local foods, at www. We'five also worked more closely with farmers and growers to increase the amount of British produce in-store. This year, for example, we sold over 40% more British apples and pears. Price We remain focused on delivering the best value to all customers. The launch of Essential Savings in May was an investment in lower prices on the everyday products which our customers buy. We have introduced more multi-buys into the promotion programme to help customers save money. We also launched our Price Check initiative this year. Price Check enables customers to check the price of individual products and the total price of their shopping online. When we compare our customers' baskets with Asda's prices, nearly 80 per cent are the same price or cheaper in Tesco than they would be in Asda. Together these initiatives have helped us to maintain our leading position in a highly competitive market and to encourage customers to switch to Tesco throughout the year. title with a circulation of 1.2 million. 18 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Growing the UK core 1,000 Recipes on www. com Availability We have maintained high levels of availability this year through a number of programmes, from better promotional forecasting through to improved processes for monitoring availability in our stores. Our customers are benefiting from this work and have noticed the improvements - customer satisfaction with availability is at a record high - up 7% from last year and 13% from the year before. We have had great success with our automated weather forecasting technology which accurately adjusts store orders and deliveries based on customers' shopping habits in different weather conditions in 14 individual regions nationwide. We have also delivered a comprehensive plan to improve availability in our Express convenience stores, resulting in a 25% reduction in the number of out-of-stock items in the evenings. Service We work continually to improve service for our customers. We have trained over 80,000 staff this year in Every Little Helps skills for checkouts, supporting them to deliver helpful, friendly and efficient service. We also know how important it is for our customers to be able to choose the checkout that is right for them, so we are working to create the ideal configuration in each of our stores based on the local customer profile. This year, we have continued to use technology to help deliver great service. Our self-service checkouts provide customers with a quick and easy option and currently account for over ten million transactions per week. Our trials of Scan as you Shop, which uses hand-held technology, have gone well too. STAFF TRAINING We have trained 80,000 staff this year in Every Little Helps skills for checkouts. EVERY COMMENT HELPS Our 'Every Comment Helps' initiative encourages customers to give instant feedback on their shopping trip - including both the customer service they receive and the range of products we offer. Customers are able to share their feedback via text or email. Over 20,000 of the comments that we have received have been compliments about the service which our customers have received. This is testament to the hard work and commitment of our teams in-store. All of the comments have helped us to understand what's important to our customers and identify where we can do better. We are putting plans into action based on the feedback we receive so that we can do even more to improve our customers' shopping experience. 19 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements T esco UK: a growth business Delivering for customers Our success begins with delivering a great shopping trip in every store. Behind our Every Little Helps philosophy lie world-class systems and processes for property, buying, distribution, ordering, store operations and marketing.

Climate change As a retail business, we know that we can make a real difference in tackling climate change - cutting our own emissions, working with suppliers and helping customers to cut their carbon footprint. In our UK business, we have led the work on climate change and for the second year running, we have reduced our absolute emissions - this year by 5% despite space growing by 7% as well as significantly reducing emissions from our baseline portfolio of buildings. Outstanding financial performance We operate a balanced scorecard approach to managing the business, based on the 'Steering Wheel' segments: Customer: Community: Operations: People: and Finance. In order to achieve sustainable profitable growth over the long term we must deliver on all these priorities. This approach means that we have delivered consistently strong financial performance each year, which has led to remarkable performance when looking over a number of years - showing the cumulative effect of consistent growth. The chart below shows the consistency and speed with which we have grown relative to our major UK peers. Tesco in the UK is an outstanding business. We are clear market leader in food retail with the broadest customer appeal, widest range of formats, market-leading systems and processes and the world's leading customer loyalty programme - Clubcard. We are the largest private employer in the UK, offering market-leading pay and rewards to our staff, and we're a leader in tackling climate change. We also generate outstanding financial performance with the highest sales densities, profit margin and return on capital of any company in the sector. 20 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Growing the UK core Revenue PSbn 00 01 98 99 02 03 06 07 04 05 08 09 10 11 96 97 40 35 25 20 30 15 10 5 Asda J Sainsbury Tesco Wm Morrison GROWTH vs COMPETITORS Source: Tesco and Deutsche Bank Research including estimates for 10 11.

Future growth The UK offers significant opportunities for growth for Tesco - in grocery, in non-food categories and in services. The UK grocery market is mature, but far from saturated. The UK has the lowest grocery space per capita of any country in the EU and only about a third of that of the United States. 0.25 0.21 0.29 0.28 Spain Poland 0.34 Germany 0.35 0.35 Italy France 0.58 US UK Netherlands sq m per capita GROCERY RETAIL SPACE PER CAPITA Source: Verdict Research space per capita, Economist Intelligence Unit population data. An important indicator of the scope for future growth of grocery space in the UK is that when new stores open the impact on existing stores is minimal. We track very closely every store opened in the UK - by Tesco and our competitors - and the impact of these new stores on Tesco's sales has remained consistently below 1% of our total sales for many years. The performance of our own mature stores opened in recent years is exceeding business plan forecasts and our profit margin and return on capital in the UK continue to strengthen. There is significant opportunity and demand for Tesco to grow its store network - for example, only 54% of UK shoppers are able to reach a Tesco Extra within 15 minutes. Convenience stores form another important segment of the grocery market. Traditionally a fragmented market, Tesco was the first of the major retailers to develop a convenience format on a national scale with Tesco Express. We now have 1,285 Express stores but this still represents only a small market share in the convenience segment and we have many years of future growth. In addition to food and other grocery items such as household and toiletries, Tesco has developed a strong offer in categories such as electricals, clothing and entertainment. In these 'new' general merchandise areas we only have around a 4% market share in a large fragmented market. With a large and loyal customer base, the leading store network and a strong online platform, we have a tremendous springboard from which to grow our market positions in these segments. We have also followed our customers into services such as banking, insurance and telecoms, building on our brand reputation for value, simplicity and great service. We have built successful businesses, such as Tesco Bank and Tesco Mobile, which are already making a significant contribution to sales and profits. There remains enormous potential for future growth in these areas, through expanding our range of products particularly in banking with mortgages and current accounts and by increasing our penetration of Tesco's 15 million Clubcard customers. TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 21 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Overall, our businesses across Asia, Europe and the United States have had a strong year, with improvements in sales, profits and returns in most markets. Introduction and market context Most of our markets have seen steady economic improvement over the past year and in some cases - particularly in Asia - sharp improvement. Countries hardest hit in the downturn - in particular Hungary, Ireland and the United States - have been slower to recover, although even there we are now seeing signs of improvement. A particularly encouraging feature of our performance in Asia and Europe has been excellent market share growth, with many of our businesses seeing strong growth in both customer numbers and like-for-like sales. We have resumed a faster pace of new space opening now that economic conditions are generally improving. We opened 6.5m sq ft of gross new space in 2010 11, compared with 5.1m sq ft in 2009 10 and plan to open a further 8.4m sq ft during the current year. Asia Our businesses in Asia have delivered another good performance leading to increases in sales and profits - supported by improving like-for-like sales growth, a useful contribution from new stores and further benefits from our acquisition in South Korea in 2008. As economies in Asia recover, we are seeing improving sales trends. Our performance was helped by favourable exchange rate movements but nevertheless profits grew by almost 18% at constant currency rates. Our businesses in South Korea and Thailand opened 56 and 119 stores respectively and delivered excellent sales and profit growth during the year as these economies rebounded sharply from recession.

We now operate 782 stores with 11m sq ft of space, having added a further 119 stores in the year. TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 23 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements ANSHAN In October, we opened our fourth Lifespace mall - our largest so far - in Anshan, China. Over 600,000 customers flow through our four Lifespace malls each week. We plan to have up to ten malls open by the end of the year. In China, we are pushing ahead with our expansion plans, opening a further 19 stores in the year, including five Express stores. Our investments in equipping the business for faster growth, combined with our store roll-out being slower than planned, meant that we made a small overall loss in the year. After a sharp contraction in 2009 the economy in Malaysia has also recovered well over the past year. Our business has delivered very good sales and profit growth driven by continued investment for customers in prices, promotions and Clubcard. In Japan, falling supermarket industry sales are providing a challenging background for our operations and the business continued to make modest losses. We were one of the first businesses to respond to the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011 with a corporate donation of PS50,000 through our partnership with the Red Cross. Our early plans in India are continuing to progress well. Our local management team is helping our franchise partner, Trent, to develop its Star Bazaar hypermarket operation. Our Asian markets offer an exciting long-term growth opportunity and will be a key focus for our future international expansion, both in our established markets and in China. We have continued to invest through the downturn to ensure that we are in an even stronger position as the economic recovery continues. This year we plan to open 5.1m sq ft of new selling area. We have also continued to make good progress in developing strong brands in our leading Asian businesses with further expansion of Clubcard and our retail services businesses.

We entered South Korea through a partnership with Samsung and opened our first two hypermarkets in 1999. Today we are a sophisticated multiformat - and moving to multichannel - retailer with 354 stores and we employ over 23,000 people. In just a decade we have grown from two shops to become the second largest retailer in the country and we're closing in on the number one position. And there is plenty more to come with significant potential for growth. The organised modern retail trade in South Korea still represents a relatively small proportion of the total market - just 54% of total retail sales. We are already the market leader in the rapidly growing grocery home shopping sector and have recently launched our general merchandise website. We're also using our admired brand, strong store network and large customer base to develop our retail services offer. Together with delivering outstanding financial performance, we are aiming to be the most respected corporate brand in South Korea and we'five already been awarded South Korea's Most Admired Company award. 21.5% Asia sales growth Revenue excludes VAT and the impact of IFRIC 13. 24 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW T o be an outstanding international retailer Europe Our operations in Europe have delivered record results and strong growth in sales, profits and margins. Recovering economies generally helped but key to this performance was the striking improvement in the competitiveness of our local businesses, which won market share rapidly. We have invested for customers through lower prices, sharper promotions and Clubcard, funded by strong productivity and substantial early benefits of our pan-European sourcing. The resulting strong sales growth has driven an improvement in profitability and margins. Sales growth varied across the region but all markets saw sharply improved like-for-like sales growth compared with 2009 10, with a good contribution also coming from new space. In Ireland, like-for-like growth in the year was significantly stronger, and although it was broadly stable during the second half, the two-year trend has continued to improve. Despite a decline in consumer confidence resulting from political and economic uncertainty and the continued fall in disposable income, our business has continued its strong relative performance with impressive market share gains. Our business in Poland had another good year, with good growth in sales and profits despite a period of subdued consumer sentiment following the Smolensk tragedy. In Hungary economic conditions and consumer confidence remain challenging but despite this our business made solid progress. Growth in the Czech Republic has been supported by the successful launch of Clubcard - with over 10% of the population already enrolled. A particularly strong performance in Slovakia with double-digit like-forlike sales growth - has led to a further increase in our market share over the last year, further consolidating our market leadership. As the economy in Turkey has continued to recover, we'five resumed a faster rate of expansion - opening 21 new stores, including ten hypermarkets - helping to support strong sales growth. With the improving economic outlook we are stepping up the rate of new store opening. Some 2.6m sq ft of new space was opened in the year, with a programme to add a further 2.9m sq ft of new space across the region in 2011 12.

Although there is clearly some way to go, with these key elements moving in the right direction, we plan to accelerate the rate of new store openings to around 50 in the current year. With the improvements in our distribution centre and manufacturing campus productivity, we now expect to break-even with around 300 stores rather than the 400 we originally anticipated. Our losses increased in the year as a consequence of the initial costs of integrating our two dedicated fresh food suppliers, 2 Sisters and Wild Rocket Foods, and exchange rate movements. These businesses have now been fully integrated with our existing kitchen operations, with substantially improved financial performance, product quality and service levels. We expect losses to reduce sharply in the current year as strong growth in like-for-like sales continues and improved store operating ratios start to deliver shop-door profitability.

TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 25 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements T o be as strong in everything we sell as we are in food We'five continued to grow sales and expand our offer in general merchandise, clothing and electricals and we have a great opportunity to do much more. Introduction and market context Our general merchandise, clothing and electrical businesses have continued to grow, despite the challenges of weak demand in some of our important markets. We have seen some strong key category and market share performances, which have helped compensate for the effects of cautious consumer spending in these more discretionary areas. In order to align with our new structures, we will going forward define non-food as general merchandise, clothing and electricals excluding health & beauty and household. Overall Group sales in this category rose 8.8% during the year to PS10.3 billion. In the UK, high petrol prices and increases in VAT have had a significant impact on discretionary consumer spending. Many high street retailers have suffered from declining sales and have issued profit warnings. Tesco has fared better - and maintained market share - but we haven't been spared the impact of subdued demand. In the UK, general merchandise, clothing and electricals sales grew by 0.4% to PS5.3 billion. General merchandise sales growth was affected by a smaller component of extension selling space in this year's new space programme, with extensions providing just 10% of new space. In our international markets the picture varies considerably by country. Most of our markets in Europe and Asia saw strong growth in general merchandise as the economic recovery took hold during the year, although a number of markets - such as Ireland and Hungary - remain challenging.

UK Improving the performance of general merchandise in the UK is one of our key priorities. Our aim is to offer our customers the same great quality, price and range in our general merchandise offer as they would find with their Tesco grocery shop. The focus is on delivering in three key areas with the aim of improving the general merchandise shopping trip for our customers: investing in making the ranges more aspirational: enhancing the shopping experience with specialist advice: and developing our multi-channel capability. Investing in making the ranges more aspirational We have invested in and expanded our general merchandise ranges to provide greater appeal to our customers. Our offer is already good but there is much more we can do - in particular by offering more aspirational products, not just everyday basics. In electricals, we were the first UK supermarket to stock the Apple iPad and the Amazon Kindle - two of the most sought-after technology products on the market. Keeping in tune with changes in technology and responding quickly to offer our customers the latest electrical innovations is central to our strategy and to building our reputation as a leading retailer in everything we sell. Enhancing the shopping experience with specialist advice We are investing in our people so that we are able to support and advise our customers when they are making big ticket purchases such as TVs or mobile phones. For example we have 194 Phone Shops offering customers impartial advice on phone packages and accessories. In over 200 of our largest stores, we have Tesco Tech Support teams, made up of staff specifically trained to help customers with technical queries on electrical items from TVs to cameras and satellite navigation systems. The additional advice helps customers get the right product for their individual needs, supporting a reduction in product returns. Alongside our in-store teams, we have a free electrical helpline for our customers, manned by fully trained engineers, and a dedicated Tech Support website. Developing our multi-channel capability Our multi-channel approach makes it easy for our customers to shop in a way that suits them - online, in-store or from catalogues. Customers can browse in a catalogue, order online and then collect in-store or they can order in-store and have the goods delivered to their home. This year, over 40% of Tesco Direct electrical purchases have been made online and picked up in-store through our Click and Collect service. We'five listened to our customers and adapted by expanding our range. We have increased the number of products available through Tesco Direct to around 23,000, but we need to do much more in order to compete with the wider ranges offered by other leading online retailers. In 2009 10, we launched our clothing site at www. The website, which combines our F&F ranges alongside some other well-known brands, has been extremely popular with customers. We are currently the fastest growing online retailer in the clothing, footwear and accessories market. INTERNATIONAL SOURCING In order to get the best priced and highest quality products for our customers, we source many food, clothing and general merchandise goods globally and buy many products directly from producers and manufacturers. Through our Group Sourcing operations, headquartered in Hong Kong above, we can ensure: better products: confidence in where and how they are made: cheaper costs: the cheapest source of products for all countries: competitive advantage: on range and quality versus market competitors: and knowledge sharing: best practice in how we source, buy, make and move products. This year, we sourced directly more than PS4 billion worth of food and general merchandise products at retail value. 28 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Strong in everything we sell Europe In Europe, general merchandise, clothing and electricals sales were strong, reflecting an overall improving consumer background and a strengthening offer in our stores. Clothing in Central Europe had a successful year with a 9% year-onyear growth in total sales. We are now the clothing market leader in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. Building on the success of the F&F brand, we have introduced our F&F Blue and F&F Basics sub-brands to provide our customers with a greater range to choose from. Our first stand-alone F&F store also opened successfully in Prague last year, highlighting the appeal of the brand in the Czech Republic. In Central Europe, our trio of mid-market MY department stores showcase our general merchandise, clothing and electricals ranges including well-known brands such as Levis, FCUK and Disney. Our flagship MY Narodni store in Prague and our stores located in Liberec and Bratislava are traditional multi-floor department stores with open layouts and a full range of product categories at multiple price points. In the year, all stores made strong progress in like-for-like sales growth with our brands such as F&F and Go Cook competing well against more established luxury brands. Our F&F clothing brand launched in South Korea and Thailand this year and the early response from customers has been excellent. SPORTS SHOPS Our Sports Multishops in South Korea have increased sales of sporting goods in these stores by over 60% with great customer feedback. Asia We have seen strong general merchandise sales growth in our Asian businesses - which are predominantly hypermarket operations. We saw particularly pleasing increases in electrical products, with double-digit growth in Thailand and over 30% in China. Our F&F clothing brand launched in South Korea and Thailand this year and the early response from customers has been excellent - a very good example of the skill and scale of the Tesco Group being applied across our global network. Last year we opened our first three Sports Multishops in Homeplus stores in South Korea. These innovative sports zones are designed to meet growing customer needs for sporting goods, in a one-stop shopping environment. Sports Multishop presents our customers with a wide range of highquality branded sporting goods, a specialised bicycle shop, a golf shop and over ten sports and outdoor brand shops, such as Nike and Adidas, in a single 15,000 sq ft location. Sports Multishop has increased sales of sporting goods in these stores by over 60% with high customer penetration. We will open Sports Multishop in ten more stores this year, with plans for further roll-out thereafter. GOING THE EXTRA MILE IN EUROPE This year we began the remodelling and conversion of some of our older hypermarkets across Central and Eastern Europe. We'five listened to our customers and are making a number of enhancements to our stores to improve the shopping trip. We'five extended our range by introducing over 5,000 products, introduced product-specialist employees to improve service, and provided a better shopping environment through the introduction of conforming layout, fixtures and fittings. We're also adding many of the complementary services such as Phone Shop, Opticians and Pharmacy to provide our customers with a wider range of general merchandise products. We'five achieved very strong sales improvements across the eight Extras completed so far - with an average uplift of 16%. These refits are delivering particularly marked uplifts in general merchandise categories, including clothing and electricals. TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 29 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements T o grow retail services in all our markets This year we'five made progress in our retail services businesses: tesco. com, Tesco Bank, Telecoms and dunnhumby - our consumer research business. We'five been investing for the customer and laying the foundations for future growth. PS4.0bn Retail services sales 15% Online businesses sales growth 30% dunnhumby's sales and profits up over 30% 6.5m Tesco Bank customer accounts 2.5m Tesco Mobile customers Introduction In July 2008 when we announced our intention to take full ownership of Tesco Bank, we set a target to grow the profitability of our retail services businesses from just under PS400 million in 2007 8 to PS1 billion. This year, we have made creditable progress in moving towards this target. We have attracted new customers, grown sales and profit and continued to invest - particularly in infrastructure - to equip the business for further growth. We want all of our customers, across all of our markets, to have access to our financial, telecoms and online services. We can do this by applying Group skill and scale and building on the knowledge which we have acquired from our retail services experience in the UK, Ireland and South Korea. In 2010 11, total retail services sales were PS4.0 billion, up 12% on 2009 10 and trading profit grew to PS583 million. Tesco Bank Despite a challenging year in the wider banking sector, and as it completes its transition to full separation from The Royal Bank of Scotland RBS, Tesco Bank continues to perform well. The business has made good progress with its systems re-platforming, which will complete as planned in 2011. We opened our new banking and insurance service centres in Glasgow and Newcastle in October 2010. All new motor and home insurance business, including renewal policies sold since then have, as planned, been written on new systems. We also launched successfully our first new product on our own banking platforms - the Fixed Rate Saver - last autumn. This has been followed by our recent innovative retail bond. Both of these initiatives exceeded plan and serve to diversify our funding base and increase the proportion of long-term funding available to the Bank. The Bank has made progress in key areas - with savings strongly up, good growth in the loan book with improved margins and an excellent year in credit cards, with the transaction value up 20% on 2009 10. The car insurance book has also resumed growth, having plateaued before the change of control, despite the inevitable challenges of migration. Retail services profit comprises profit from Telecoms, tesco. com, dunnhumby and Tesco Bank, including UK store ATM income. 30 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Growing retail services TESCO TELECOMS We now have 194 Phone Shops in stores across the UK and this year, we have begun to open Phone Shops in our refreshed Extra stores in Central Europe. Our Phone Shops provide our customers with support and advice so that they can choose the best option for them. 194 Phone Shops in the UK TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 31 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Customer account numbers grew well - in active credit cards by 11%, personal loans by 17% and motor insurance by 8%. Our Fixed Rate Saver product significantly exceeded expectations and we ended the year with a balance of PS397 million, 40% higher than planned, and we now have one, two and three-year options available for customers. The range of products available for customers will be broadened further this year with the planned launch of mortgages. The Bank's bad debt position has significantly improved year-on-year, with the charge to the income statement 26% lower, despite the growth in lending, as credit card and loan defaults reduced, helped by good management of bad debt and the quality of our new business. This excellent progress on bad debt has also resulted in an increase in the release of the fair value provisions we made in the Group balance sheet on acquisition. Based on a lower than expected level of claims, we have also released some of our provisions for customer claims against payment protection insurance policies. These strong elements of the Bank's performance mean that we have been able to offset the substantial extra provisions made in the year related to bodily injury claims in our motor insurance business - a trend affecting the whole industry - and the costs of migration, yet still deliver increased trading profit. The baseline profitability of the Bank - before provisions movements and the adjustments required under acquisition accounting - continues to improve steadily, whilst absorbing the higher costs of migration away from RBS. We expect further improvements in the baseline profitability in 2011 12. Our Core Tier 1 capital ratio has risen substantially - to a healthy 15.9% at the year end. The strong growth in the Bank's deposit base means that we have a significant excess of deposits over loans, as we build out balance sheet capacity ahead of the planned launch of mortgages. com Our online businesses, including online grocery and Tesco Direct, had another strong year. Taking into account our operations in South Korea and Ireland, total sales grew by 15%. Our UK operations continued to grow well, with double-digit growth in grocery and a further 30% increase at Tesco Direct. We have worked consistently over the past year to innovate for customers in our online businesses so that we can provide them with a better online shopping trip. Our work on upgrading our tesco. com website has enabled us to launch an iPhone grocery app, which has been very popular - accounting for over 12% of customer traffic to the tesco. We know that our customers lead busy lives and love the convenience of our home grocery delivery service, so this year we have invested to make life even easier for customers. In the UK, we have successfully launched one hour delivery slots in London and we have been trialling a new Click and Collect service for groceries, which allows people to order online and collect their items from a store. So that we can support our growth momentum, we have increased our UK-wide delivery capacity by adding an extra 350 vans to our fleet and we are currently trialling a new scheduling system to increase the efficiency of our vans. Tesco Direct provides a platform to extend the reach of our general merchandise, clothing and electricals offer through the internet and catalogues. This year, Direct has achieved strong growth of 30%, including clothing online, which represents solid progress against a backdrop of continued pressure on household budgets through 2010 and early 2011. Throughout the year, we have made significant investments in our stores to improve the multi-channel shopping offer which is available through Direct. For example, customers can order online and pick up in-store or order in-store and have their delivery dropped off at their door. We have added 30 new Direct desks and 89 Collection Points and we now have 11 Order and Collect stores. In South Korea, we have launched a general merchandise website to complement the current grocery site. The new website launched in January. Our online business has performed well in Ireland with a 15% increase in sales and 12.5% increase in orders. In the next year, we are launching online shopping sites in the Czech Republic and Poland. 12% 12% of customer traffic to tesco. com site coming via our grocery app PS2m Our international calling card has generated sales of over PS2 million since its launch TESCO CREDIT CARD In February, one in eight of all MasterCard and Visa credit card transactions in the UK were made on a Tesco credit card. 32 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Growing retail services Tesco Telecoms Our Telecoms business grew well during the year, maintaining strong market share, driven primarily by the growth of Tesco Mobile. In 2010 Tesco Mobile was one of the fastest growing UK mobile networks, growing its customer base by 24% to over 2.5 million. Customers have responded positively to an increase in the number of mobile handsets we are offering, including the latest smartphones from Android to HTC models. In 2010, we entered the international calling card market. The market has recently been investigated by OFCOM and Tesco was one of the top performing service providers praised for its value, clarity and customer service. Our international calling card has generated sales of over PS2 million since launching and around 16,000 cards are sold in-store every week. Our Tesco Mobile joint ventures with O2 in Ireland and Slovakia are performing well. Both businesses are growing strongly and moved into profit for the first time this year. dunnhumby dunnhumby has had a very strong year, increasing sales and profits by over 30% with excellent growth in the UK supplier business and from its overseas joint ventures with retailers. Following the acquisition of the final 10% of the business in the first half of the year, dunnhumby is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesco. HOMEPLUS Homeplus is the number one grocery home shopping provider in South Korea, delivering just under 1.5 million orders last year. TESCO DIRECT In November 2010, Tesco Direct launched a new mobile website allowing customers to easily browse for and buy general merchandise items on their smartphone. DUNNHUMBY dunnhumby was founded in 1989 by Edwina Dunn and Clive Humby with the intention of embedding customer insight into the way organisations work. By analysing data from over 340 million people in 25 countries, dunnhumby helps companies to put their customers at the centre of every business decision. dunnhumby uses the insight generated by data they gather to allow companies to improve customers' experiences of shopping in their stores, branding and marketing. They work with companies to help them tailor their offer to the needs and wants of their customers. dunnhumby's work with some of the world's biggest retailers and brands has demonstrated that companies which deliver value to customers through personalisation earn customers' loyalty. This strategic approach of putting the customer first in business improves their clients' like-for-like sales and profit margins - or, put simply, creates measurable value. Employing more than 1,500 people in 30 offices in Europe, Asia and the Americas, dunnhumby serves a prestigious list of companies including Kellogg's, The Kroger Co. Muller, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Mars. dunnhumby's work has also extended beyond the grocery sector to include partnerships with Macy's, Shell and the Panera Bread Company. dunnhumby has worked with Tesco since the launch of Clubcard in the UK in 1995 and now works across the 12 markets where we have Clubcard. TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 33 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements T o be a creator of highly valued brands Tesco has been an industry leader in branding for many years using our broad appeal, wide product assortment and global supply chains to develop businesses that deliver reliable, innovative and great value brands for customers. The creation and spread of a number of strong brands has helped us to become a growth company, trusted by customers, valued by staff, respected by communities and profitable for shareholders. A brand is a promise, a set of fundamental principles that define a product or business. It is an intangible representation of what a company stands for in the minds of its customers and other stakeholders. Retail brands Product brands Pillar brands 38 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Building brands TESCO VALUE AND FINEST IN THE UK Customers appreciate the quality and breadth of our range and we are continuing to innovate in this area, particularly with our Pillar brands. The popularity of our Pillar brands with customers has meant that Tesco Value has become the second largest food brand in the UK - ahead of Coca-Cola - with sales of more than PS1 billion a year. Tesco Value is only pushed into second place by Tesco Finest. More than half of our customers buy from the Finest range on a regular basis, from Finest spectacles to Finest Restaurant Collection ready meals, making it an important component of our sales mix. PS1 bn Both Finest and Value now sell more than PS1bn each year TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 39 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Why are we building brands? Building brands enhances the value of our business by benefiting all of our stakeholders, including customers, staff, communities and shareholders. Being viewed positively by our stakeholders supports the creation of a successful, sustainable and profitable long-term business. What's the benefit to both our stakeholders and our Company of building brands? By building strong brands through our own products, we offer customers increased value, choice and quality. They are loyal to our brands because they know what to expect from them and what they stand for. With wine, for example, the Finest logo helps customers to pick out a good quality option without having to be a connoisseur. Strong Product and Pillar brands give us a key point of differentiation from our competitors and enable us to continue to meet the changing needs of our customers. Once customers understand the values that our brands stand for, they are more likely to trust in our ability to diversify into new service areas. In financial services, for example, with Tesco Bank we'five brought straightforward and good-quality banking solutions based on the needs of our customers to a market characterised by complexity and poor customer service. Wherever we operate we support local communities, their causes and the environment. Through initiatives such as our Community Champions programme, Get Healthy with Tesco Lotus in Thailand and the UK Tesco Great School Run, we're known to be a good neighbour. By benefiting local communities, our brand has taken on new meaning among stakeholders - that of a responsible retailer. By developing a brand reputation for offering great value and service to customers and being a responsible member of the community, we can attract great people to work for us. As a responsible and flexible employer with a track record of developing talent within the business, Tesco is also seen as a great place to build a career. The increased emotional and functional loyalty from customers, staff and communities generated by our brand building has contributed to Tesco becoming a profitable, sustainable growth opportunity for shareholders to invest in. Investment provides us with further opportunities to build and develop our brands across the Group, in turn allowing us to diversify to the benefit of customers, staff, communities and shareholders. Homeplus received South Korea's Most Admired Company award in October 2010 The increased emotional and functional loyalty from customers, staff and communities generated by our brand building has contributed to Tesco becoming a profitable, sustainable growth opportunity for shareholders. We launched our clothing brand F&F in the UK in 2001 with the aim of offering unbeatable value for money, not compromised by quality, design or provenance. F&F is now available in over 450 stores across the UK and is also available online. As awareness and popularity has grown in the UK, we'five also extended the brand - launching F&F in nine other markets across Europe and Asia. F&F is already the market-leading clothing brand in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. As the brand continues to develop, we opened our first stand-alone F&F store above - in Prague - this year. As customers have begun to gain confidence in the F&F brand, we have also broadened our range - with sub-brands such as F&F Basics, F&F Couture above and F&F Petite and extended the brand into homeware with a good, better, best hierarchy under F&F Home Basics, F&F Home and F&F Home Collection. F&F 40 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Building brands When entering a new market, building highquality stores in great locations is a priority. Our founder, Jack Cohen, developed the first store in the UK, which culminated in the 1980s with the Tesco superstore - still a core part of Tesco today. We'five since gone on to develop hypermarket format stores and smaller formats such as Metro and Express. It's important that our stores meet customers' expectations. A multi-format store offer, from Express to Extra, provides customers with different shopping trips to suit their varied needs. In Europe, we are introducing Extras, offering customers more products and services, from Phone Shops to Pharmacies. A crucial part of building an efficient network is the creation of centralised distribution centres to serve the store network quickly and efficiently. In Thailand this year, Tesco Lotus built its first Fresh Distribution Centre, handling over 230,000 cases of food every day. In China, we opened three distribution centres to serve our growing network. Once a network has been built in a market, we can begin to evolve a collection of stores into a Retail brand and to develop Product and Pillar brands. Through the introduction of Pillar brands, in food, for example, we provide customers with great choice, value and quality. We work hard to make sure that each of our brands is distinguishable and lives up to our customers' expectations. This builds the crucial element of trust in our brands. It also enables us to differentiate ourselves from other retailers, particularly in less developed markets. Clubcard provides us with unique insight into our customers' shopping habits so that we can continuously work to meet their needs. Clubcard gives our customers a sense of belonging and says 'thank you' by rewarding them for their loyalty. As a result, customers trust in and feel committed to the Tesco brand. Once Retail, Product and Pillar brands are present in a market, customers have an understanding of what our brands stand for - they trust in them. This means that our customers have confidence in our ability to deliver different products and services, allowing us to extend the Tesco brand into new areas. In many cases, the extension of our brand accompanies changes in our customers' lives. Changes such as the growth of the internet have led to the creation of new platforms for our brands with tesco. We're also innovating for our customers, offering new innovative products, such as our successful Tesco Bank Fixed Rate Saver. We're now beginning to extend the brand in a number of our international markets. In South Korea, we have a number of co-branded credit card offers to which 1.3 million customers have signed up, demonstrating the strength of the Homeplus brand. BUILDING THE NETWORK BUILDING THE BRAND EXTENDING THE BRAND EVOLUTION OF THE TESCO BRAND When entering new markets across the world we have broadly followed the same model, adapting where necessary to reflect the local culture and sentiment. Extending the brand Building the brand Building the network TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 41 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements T o build our team so that we create more value We are sharing operational excellence and leadership excellence across the Group so that we can successfully develop capability and nurture talent across our growing business. 492,714 Employees 75% We pay at least 75% of employee medical, dental, prescription and vision costs in the US 1,274 Employees at Tesco Bank PS1 05.5m Value of shares awarded under Shares In Success 70% Increase in the number of female Directors across the Group Introduction We treat people how we like to be treated. We want our people to enjoy working at Tesco. Our people do a great job each and every day by giving our customers the best possible shopping trip. By creating an open environment of trust and respect, our people feel supported, they share their knowledge and experience and work hard to give our customers great service. We support our people, trusting in their ability to deliver while helping them to reach their full potential. We encourage our people to learn on the job and take responsibility from day one. Giving our people an opportunity to get on in their careers is very important. With the increasing breadth of the Tesco business, our people have a great opportunity to develop their skills and experience across new product areas, services and countries. Every year, we build our plans for the year around our People Promises. We want all of our people across all of our markets to: be treated with respect: have an opportunity to get on: have a manager who helps them: and have an interesting job. It's through our People Promises and our benefits package that we are proud to say that our people stay with us for a long time. Around half of our Director population has at least 12 years' service. In recognition of the importance of people across our business, our Group Personnel Director, Alison Horner, is now part of our Executive Committee. Alison is a great example of talent developed in Tesco, with 12 years of experience across the business in both Personnel and Operations. 42 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Building our team CAREER DEVELOPMENT We believe that home-grown managers make valuable business leaders because they understand our culture and approach. Our new CEO, Philip Clarke, is an example of this, having started work at Tesco part-time as a schoolboy. Across the business, we currently have almost 30,000 people on development programmes, gaining the knowledge, leadership skills and qualifications for their next role. 30,000 People training for their next role TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 43 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements We know that to be a successful international retailer we need to combine deep local knowledge with global experience. We are committed to developing local leaders in each country we're in. In South Korea, our largest international business, we have over 23,000 employees and just nine people from our UK business. We are also keen to provide opportunities for our people to gain experience in our global markets. As the business grows, Tesco benefits from moving our people around, sharing their skills and expertise across the Group. We want the women in our teams to achieve their full potential. Back in 1997 in the UK, we had only 31 female Store Managers, we now have almost 150. In the last four years in the UK the number of female directors has increased by nearly 70% across the Group and we have three women on our Board. Our Women's Network provides skills development, mentoring and networking opportunities for our female managers and directors, and this year we're launching our new Women in Leadership programme. Over 50 women from our UK and European businesses have been nominated based on their potential to undertake bigger and broader roles. The programme consists of seminars and courses focusing on confidence, strategic career planning and building personal authority. Three women in Tesco are currently being coached as part of the FTSE 100 Cross-Company Mentoring Programme. The Programme, launched in 2003, involves FTSE 100 Chairmen and CEOs acting as mentors to senior women just below board level in other FTSE companies. The mentors guide and advise women in the management of their careers so that they are better positioned to be considered for board appointments. Our Chairman David Reid, will begin working with his third mentee from outside Tesco in June 2011. Building capability As part of our ongoing commitment to building capability, we are investing in the Tesco Academy. Our Academy supports the development of our people through training courses, networking opportunities and mentoring. Our Academy is especially important to our managers and directors, supporting them in the delivery of their day-to-day roles and the development of their leadership capabilities. In July, we will open our zero-carbon Academy centre in Incheon, South Korea. Asia is a rapidly growing region for Tesco and the Academy will help us to build capability in the area. Each and every job in Tesco has a clearly assigned training programme to accompany it. We work hard to ensure that every member of our team receives the operational training which they need for their job and the leadership skills which can support their career development. In China, our Store Manager Programme has been created so that we can recruit and develop people to become our future Store Managers. This is especially important as we expand in this quickly developing country. The programme started in October 2010 with 22 candidates taking part. Thailand is currently in the process of recruiting candidates so that they can launch their own Store Manager Programme. Recruitment and growth As Tesco grows and diversifies, we are able to offer more jobs and broader roles to people in the communities around our stores, depots and offices. This year we have recruited 21,000 people worldwide. Over the past year, the Tesco Bank workforce has more than tripled in size. As Tesco Bank develops, we have an increasing need for people to join the team so that we can support the expanding Tesco Bank customer base. The vast majority of the new Tesco Bank staff are customer service representatives and team leaders, following the opening of new call centres in Newcastle and Glasgow this year. Our graduate programmes fast track graduate trainees with high potential into leadership positions. This year we have recruited around 140 Commercial graduates into UK and Central European buying and general merchandise roles - the largest number of Commercial graduates that we have employed since the programme began. This is part of our ongoing commitment to invest in future leaders. Talent and promotions One of our People Promises is that we will provide 'an opportunity to get on'. We promise to support and develop our people so that they are able to advance in their careers. All of our people have discussions about their careers and performance and all of our leadership teams talk about succession plans and talent at least once a year. FRESH & EASY Our US business, Fresh & Easy, created over 800 jobs this year and the opening of our first 11 stores in Northern California created a further 300 local jobs in March and April. All Fresh & Easy employees have the opportunity to work at least 20 hours per week, which entitles them to comprehensive and affordable healthcare, with Fresh & Easy picking up the majority of the costs. 44 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Building our team In Malaysia, we have launched our Finance Graduate Programme. Building on the knowledge gained from our UK Finance Graduate scheme, the Malaysian programme was launched to support our ambition of becoming an employer of choice for Finance in the country. By supporting and developing local graduates, we can also support the development of our Finance capability in Asia. Rewards and benefits Our people do a great job for our customers and we want them to feel valued and rewarded. We believe that staff rewards should be competitive, simple and sustainable to build trust and loyalty amongst our employees and assist with hiring and retention. We invest in pay and, in the UK, we have the highest basic pay rates for customer assistants of any major supermarket. All of our staff move to higher rates of pay within a year of joining our business. Across all of our markets, we offer a wide range of competitive benefits. In the US, for example, we pay at least 75% of medical, dental, prescription and vision costs. Our staff Clubcard launched in Thailand and Malaysia this year with a positive reception from our staff, and we are planning to introduce the staff Clubcard into two further countries later this year. The card offers a discount to staff when they shop in our stores. In the UK we have a defined benefit pension scheme which is greatly valued by our staff and rare among FTSE 100 companies. Our UK pension provides people with an annual income at retirement as well as benefits on ill health and death based on their pay and service. Last year we invested over PS270 million in our UK staff pensions. Share ownership incentive schemes help our staff to get their own personal stake in Tesco. 216,000 staff shared a total of PS105.5 million when the Shares In Success scheme matured in 2010. TESCO ACADEMY Our zero-carbon Tesco Academy centre in Incheon, South Korea, will open in July. T o read the Annual Report online: http: ar2011. com DEGREE PROGRAMMES In a number of our markets, we provide our people with the opportunity to study for a degree while they work. In the UK and Ireland, we provide the opportunity for employees to complete a Retail Foundation Degree. This is a two-year retail degree undertaken by staff members in association with Manchester Metropolitan University. The first pilot group of 17 employees began their courses in 2007 and graduated in 2009. These students spend several days at university at the beginning of each term and the rest of their studying is either conducted online, by telephone or via email. This way, they earn while they learn, with Tesco paying all their fees. Given that university fees are now much higher in the UK, we expect the popularity of this scheme to increase dramatically. Over the past two years, 56 students have graduated and over 60% of this population have progressed to a higher managerial role. Building on from the success in the UK and Ireland, in 2008 in Turkey we launched a Retail Programme in collaboration with Izmir Economic University. Whilst they are studying, students complete vocational training with Tesco Kipa, which ensures them a guaranteed job with us after their graduation. In Turkey, unemployment for young people is especially high so the guarantee of a job at the end of the programme makes a real difference. of those who have completed a Retail Foundation Degree have progressed to a higher managerial role OUR FIRST NATIONAL VALUES AWARDS CEREMONY We want our people to feel valued for the work which they do. In our business, we have Values awards which are given to colleagues to say thank you when they have gone the extra mile in their work. Last year, we had our first ever Values Awards Ceremony in the UK. The ceremony recognised the exceptional contributions made by colleagues from all levels across the business. 60 finalists attended the event from over 6,000 nominations. The nominees were put forward by colleagues in a variety of categories from 'Snow Hero' to 'Being first for customers'. The event was a great success and will be repeated this year. TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 45 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Finding the right location Our Site Research departments in each country direct the property acquisition strategy by identifying optimal locations for new store developments and extensions. This work is underpinned by advanced spatial analysis and a data-led approach that considers our customers, competitors, local market shares and existing store performance. The Site Research teams provide sales forecasts for new stores using highly accurate, in-house models built using our existing store performance, Clubcard data, demographic data, government statistics and road networks. On average we forecast the sales of new UK stores to within 3% accuracy. Property - developing and building stores for customers Tesco's property activities have one principal objective: to ensure our customers can benefit from the best located and designed stores. As a result of this property development and management, we also create sustainable, long-term, embedded value for shareholders. Acquiring high-quality property is an important component of being a successful retailer. Through our experience over decades in the UK - and more recently in international markets - we have market-leading property skills that help us stay ahead of our competitors. We have built up a substantial set of assets, which in total have a market value of PS36 billion. By owning our property we get the benefits of appreciation in property prices - in particular in the emerging markets in which we operate. The process for creating value in property starts with finding the right location. After acquiring a site and gaining planning consent we design and build a world-class store. We then trade from that store and increase its value as we grow our sales. And then once an asset is mature we look to crystallise the value created by selling it and leasing it back at a reasonable rent. This frees up capital which can be invested in new developments. Flexible, multi-format approach Having multiple formats - from large shopping malls to Express convenience stores - allows us to fulfil the full range of shopping missions for customers and it also gives us flexibility to adapt to different local markets and planning regimes. In some cases we also develop mixed-use projects, combining new retail space with residential development on the same site. This enables us to build a store on a desirable site when otherwise it would not be economically viable. 46 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Property Design blueprints Our formats are supported by design blueprints to ensure best practice is replicated across the Tesco Group. We have used our successful UK formats and experience internationally to build plans for each of our formats, as well as for our mall developments. The blueprints codify guidelines for the sales area, design standards, operating procedures, people plans and financial insight. They also allow us to build for less as we standardise building specifications and fixtures and fittings for Group scale buying. SHOPPING MALLS Tesco is one of the world's largest operators of shopping malls, with approximately 30m sq ft of mall space across Europe and Asia. In these markets we have found that the most successful hypermarkets are located in busy shopping malls and by owning and operating our own malls we are able to ensure we have highquality sites from which our hypermarkets can trade. Our mall business is a combination of owning and operating existing malls - as a landlord - and building new malls as a developer. The mall business provides a stable, profitable income stream - one that has grown throughout the recession. Our significant experience in operating malls and our many long-term tenant relationships with retailers help us to design and fill our new malls. Our fastest expansion in new malls is currently in China where we are rolling out our new Lifespace mall concept. The blueprint is approximately 400,000 sq ft of retail and family leisure space anchored by a Tesco hypermarket. We have four malls currently trading and expect to have up to ten by the end of this year. We're also starting to redevelop some of our older malls around the world to access their full potential. In a number of markets we are starting to convert small strips of shops alongside well-located Tesco hypermarkets into large modern shopping malls, creating compelling retail destinations. Property Finance Strategy Tesco releases some of the value that it has created through carefully selected divestments of some of its property, as well as taking advantage of strong market conditions offering good yields. Over the last five years we have delivered in excess of PS5 billion of proceeds in line with our stated objectives in 2006 at an average net initial yield of 4.9%. We have also generated profits from property-related items of PS1.3 billion over the past five years. We have used the proceeds to invest in property assets in growth economies, buy back c. PS1.1 billion of our own shares and enhance dividends for shareholders. In the future we intend to deliver PS250 - PS350 million per year in property profits, which is a sustainable profit stream as it is broadly equivalent to the value we create through development activities. This will require us to divest just over PS1 billion of property per year. This level of divestment is sustainable as we invest around PS2.5 billion per year in growth capital - so the asset base will continue to grow. It is currently more attractive to divest UK property as yields and projected GDP growth in the UK are lower than in our overseas markets. Over time however, we expect a growing proportion of the divestments to come from our other countries as properties mature. Some of these future international divestments will be shopping malls that have been fully developed. In such cases, we will release capital for new investments by selling the mall to investors and leasing back the Tesco hypermarket. Importantly, when we do this, it will always be our objective to manage the malls after divestment to ensure they remain excellent locations from which our hypermarkets can succeed.

The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group has an appropriate approach to risk management and internal control within the context of achieving the Group's objectives. Our process for identifying and managing risks is set out in more detail from page 71 of the Directors' report on corporate governance. The table below sets out the principal risks faced by the Group and examples of relevant key controls and mitigating factors. The Board considers these to be the most significant risks. They do not comprise all risks associated with the Group and are not set out in any order of priority. Additional risks not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse effect on the business. Risk is an accepted part of doing business. The real challenge for any business is to identify the principal risks it faces and to develop and monitor appropriate controls.

In addition to the principal risks above that apply generally to the Group as a whole, the section below sets out principal risks relating specifically to the Bank. Funding and liquidity Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank, although solvent, either does not have available sufficient financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure such resources only at excessive cost Funding risk is the risk that the Bank does not have sufficiently stable and diverse sources of funding or the funding structure is inefficient Dedicated Treasury function responsible for management of funding and liquidity risks within the framework approved by Tesco Bank Board Conservative Balance Sheet structure with prudent risk appetite supported by explicit targets and metrics which enable funding and liquidity to be managed in excess of regulatory requirements Strong liquid position with a diversified stock of highly marketable liquid assets that can be used as a buffer against unforeseen impacts on cash flow or in stressed environments Lending activities are primarily funded by retail deposits Daily monitoring and management of key funding and liquidity ratios with monthly reporting to Assets & Liabilities Management Committee and Tesco Bank Board Regular stress testing undertaken to assess the adequacy of funding and liquidity resources during periods of market dislocation and stress External environment The Bank is exposed to general UK economic conditions as well as general market trends in the areas in which it operates. Economic conditions are subject to significant uncertainty with commentators split on the sustainability of the economic recovery. General economic and market conditions are likely to have an impact on the Bank's credit portfolios Independent Credit Risk team, reporting directly to Chief Risk Officer, responsible for the development and oversight of the credit risk framework and supporting the business in the implementation of policies and processes Low credit risk appetite with focus on responsible lending and maintaining a risk profile better than the industry average Whilst credit performance has remained strong and favourable to industry averages, the Bank continues to closely monitor its credit portfolios and make changes to its business acquisition and credit limit management strategies to mitigate, as far as possible, downside economic risks The impact of extreme but plausible deterioration in economic conditions is considered as part of the Bank's stress-testing programme Regular reporting of credit risk information and performance against risk appetite to Tesco Bank's Risk Management Committee, Board Risk Committee and Board 54 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Principal risks and uncertainties Principal risks Key controls and mitigating factors TESCO BANK FINANCIAL SERVICES RISKS CONTINUED Insurance risk The Bank is exposed to insurance risks directly through its historic distribution agreement with Royal Bank of Scotland Insurance RBSI and indirectly through its ownership of 49.9% of Tesco Underwriting Limited TU, an authorised insurance company The key insurance risks within TU relate to underwriting risk and specifically the potential for a major weather event to generate significant Home insurance claims or, in relation to Motor insurance, the cost of settling bodily injury claims The legacy arrangement with RBSI is now in run-off and the primary risk that the Bank remains exposed to is reserving risk - the risk that reserves set aside by RBSI will be insufficient to cover the ultimate cost of insurance claims arising. This is particularly relevant to Motor insurance claims where the ultimate cost of large bodily injury claims is uncertain and the time taken to settle such claims can vary significantly depending on the severity of the injury Since October 2010 Pet, Travel and Breakdown insurance have all been distributed by the Bank on a 'white label' basis. The Bank does not carry the insurance risks associated with these products Independent Tesco Bank Insurance Risk team, reporting directly to Chief Risk Officer, that operates as the primary contact across all risk disciplines for the insurance business Underwriting risks actively managed within TU with close monitoring of performance metrics. Independent oversight conducted by the Bank Performance against insurance risk appetite is monitored closely at a senior level and reported to Tesco Bank's Risk Management Committee, Board Risk Committee and Board Reinsurance programme to limit the Bank's exposure above predetermined levels The impact of specific Motor and Home insurance events is considered as part of the Bank's stress-testing programme and ICAAP Regulatory environment Regulatory risk is the risk of failure to meet the Bank's obligations under the Financial Services and Markets Act FSMA, the Consumer Credit Act and the Data Protection Act and to meet the expectations of regulators. The Bank is subject to significant regulatory oversight, including supervision by the FSA which has substantial powers of intervention There is currently a significant amount of regulatory change including the continued evolution of capital and liquidity requirements. The regulatory landscape is changing with current FSA responsibilities due to migrate to the new Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. Detailed proposals for the new regulatory authorities are due to be published later this year There remains continued regulatory focus in relation to 'Conduct Risk' or 'Treating Customers Fairly' TCF. Specifically there has been continued focus on complaints relating to the sale of Payment Protection Insurance PPI Independent Regulatory Risk team, reporting directly to Chief Risk Officer, providing oversight and support to the business to ensure that regulatory risks are identified and managed appropriately The Bank has minimal appetite for regulatory risks and it maintains a control framework, including a suite of risk policies, to comply with regulatory requirements Regular reporting of regulatory risks to Tesco Bank's Risk Management Committee, Board Risk Committee and Board as well as to the FSA Significant senior management time and focus allocated to management of regulatory risks and the ongoing regulatory relationship The Bank has established a 'TCF Board' which is responsible for monitoring and challenging the customer-related aspects of the Tesco Bank business and, where appropriate, recommending further action PPI complaints handling brought in-house to improve the customer experience and to ensure that the outcomes are aligned with the policy introduced by the Bank The Bank has recognised a provision for potential customer redress, including compensation that may be required in relation to PPI complaints TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 55 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Principal risks Key controls and mitigating factors TESCO BANK FINANCIAL SERVICES RISKS CONTINUED Operations Operational risk is the risk of loss caused by human error, ineffective or inadequately designed processes, system failure or improper conduct including criminal activity A significant amount of services and processes are provided by third-party service providers and currently a key operational risk to the business is a failure by an outsourced provider The Bank has low appetite for operational risk, although it accepts higher risk in the short term as a result of the transformation programme, with the operational risk framework overseen by a dedicated unit within independent Risk function Risk registers maintained across the Bank which capture and quantify the risks arising in each of the commercial, insurance, operations and central functions areas Third-party services are managed through a series of Commercial Services Agreements CSAs with effective oversight arrangements established to ensure CSAs are delivered in compliance with contractual terms Regular reporting of operational risk information and performance, including financial crime, against risk appetite to Tesco Bank's Risk Management Committee, Board Risk Committee and Board Transformation programme The Bank has embarked on a significant transformation programme to develop and embed its own infrastructure to allow it to migrate systems and support from the Royal Bank of Scotland Group infrastructure In addition, the Bank has well-developed plans for launching mortgages, subject to FSA approval. Vertex, a leading global Customer Management Outsourcing business, will support entry into the mortgage market by providing IT application platforms and customer sales and service for the Bank's mortgage business. Current accounts are another key element in widening the Bank's product range with the customer proposition and detailed programme plans currently being developed. The addition of new products adds further to the complexity and delivery challenge of the transformation programme The Transformation Delivery Group TDG is the key governance forum for the delivery of the programme objectives. The forum is chaired by the Bank's Chief Operating Officer with representation across all areas of the Bank including Commercial, Operations, IT, Risk and Finance Strong programme governance in place with TDG supported by Programme Implementation Boards and Project Control Committees Project management disciplines in place, including detailed programme plans and risk and issue management to enable effective management of the programme scope, delivery timelines and adherence to budget Ongoing programme of audit reviews, risk profiles and 'health checks' with monthly reporting to Tesco Bank's Risk Management Committee, Audit Committee and Board 56 -- TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW Principal risks and uncertainties Some of the larger UK banks have significant funding targets for 2011 and, coupled with the expiry of the Special Liquidity Scheme, will increase the possibility of aggressive competition in both the retail and wholesale funding markets. This increase in demand could increase the cost of both retail and wholesale funding although improving market sentiment in the wholesale funding markets may generate additional supply. It is intended that the majority of the Bank's funding will continue to be raised in the retail deposit market with a product range and competitive deposit rates designed to attract a wider customer base. The Bank also accesses the wholesale funding markets, having successfully completed a PS125 million Wholesale Bond from the Bank's Euro Medium Term Note programme which provides an additional source of funding from retail investors. Interest rate risk management Our objective is to limit our profit and loss downside from rising interest rates. Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and floors are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Our policy is to fix interest rates for the year on a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs of the Group excluding Tesco Bank. At the year end, PS6.2 billion of debt 2010 - PS5.6 billion was at fixed rates of interest. This equates to 91% of total debt 2010 - 72%. The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate form. The average rate of interest paid on an historic cost basis this year, excluding joint ventures and associates, was 5.4% 2010 - 5.4%. Interest rate risk arises where assets and liabilities in Tesco Bank's banking activities have different repricing dates. Tesco Bank policy seeks to minimise the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates. Potential exposures to interest rate movements in the medium to long term are measured and controlled through position and sensitivity limits. Short-term exposures are measured and controlled in terms of net interest income sensitivity over 12 months to a 1% parallel movement in interest rates. Tesco Bank also uses Value at Risk VaR for risk management purposes with a time horizon of one trading day and a confidence interval of 95%. Interest rate risk is managed using interest rate swaps as the main hedging instrument. Foreign currency risk management Our principal objective is to reduce the effect of exchange rate volatility on operating margins. Transactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are managed, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies and currency options. At the year end, forward foreign currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to PS1.615 billion were outstanding 2010 - PS1.083 billion as detailed in note 22. We do not actively hedge our investment in our international subsidiaries other than by ensuring that each subsidiary is appropriately leveraged. During the year, currency movements decreased the net value of the Group's overseas assets by PS241 million last year increase of PS477 million. We translate overseas profits at average foreign exchange rates which we do not currently further manage. Financial review The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and credit risks relating to the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions. The management of these risks is set out below. The Group Balance Sheet position at 26 February 2011 is representative of the position throughout the year. Funding and liquidity The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, disposals of property assets, long and medium-term debt capital market issues, short-term commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases. The objective is to ensure continuity of funding. The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities and a strong credit rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. Tesco Group has a long-term rating of A3 with a negative outlook by Moody's, Astable with Fitch and Astable by Standard & Poor's. New funding of PS1.7 billion was arranged during the year, including a net PS1.6 billion from property disposals and PS0.1 billion from long-term debt. At the year end, net debt was PS6.8 billion 2010 - PS7.9 billion. Liquidity and funding has been a key area of focus in the banking industry and for financial services regulators. The FSA's new liquidity framework became effective on 1 June 2010 with Tesco Bank subject to additional liquidity requirements in the form of Individual Liquidity Guidance ILG. Tesco Bank maintains a robust and prudent liquidity risk management approach with an effective governance structure for measuring, managing and monitoring liquidity, as defined in its Liquidity Risk Management Policy, which provides the framework which enables funding and liquidity to be maintained in excess of regulatory requirements. The Bank has built up a strong liquidity position with a diversified stock of highly marketable liquid assets that can be used as a buffer against unforeseen impacts on cash flow or in stressed environments. Stress testing is regularly undertaken to simulate how events may impact its funding and liquidity capabilities and is updated where required as market conditions evolve. The Bank's first Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment ILAA was submitted to the FSA during the year with external assurance provided in relation to this report. TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 -- 57 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Credit risk The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions across an approved list of counterparties of good credit quality. The Group's positions with these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored. Tesco Bank retail credit risk is managed through the credit risk policy framework, which is agreed through the Tesco Bank Risk Management Committee and defines limits and standards at all stages of the customer lifecycle, including new account sanctioning, customer management and collections and recoveries activity. Customer credit decisions are managed principally through the deployment of bespoke credit scorecard models and credit policy rules which restrict specific areas of lending, and an affordability assessment which determines a customer's ability to repay an outstanding credit amount. Wholesale counterparty credit risk limits are managed in accordance with a control framework, approved by the Tesco Bank Risk Management Committee, which sets limits based on counterparty creditworthiness and instrument type. Tesco Bank continues to use Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's ratings as part of the credit assessment process. Insurance We purchased assets, earnings and combined liability protection from the open insurance market for higher value losses only. The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the business by using our captive insurance companies, ELH Insurance Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the Republic of Ireland. ELH Insurance Limited covers Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability, while Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability only.

      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE": "- The company's **Return on Equity (ROE)** decreased from approximately **16.7% in the previous year** to **15.9% in the current year**, indicating a slight deterioration in profitability relative to shareholders\u2019 equity.\n- This decline suggests that the company generated **lower net income per unit of equity** compared to the previous year.\n- Key drivers include a **modest increase in profit before tax** (from \u00a32.917bn to \u00a33.176bn) but a proportionally larger increase in **shareholders' equity or retained earnings**, which diluted ROE.\n- The **increase in net borrowings** from \u00a37.9bn to \u00a39.6bn in the prior year but then reduced to \u00a37.9bn this year reflects shifts in the capital structure impacting financial leverage and thereby ROE.\n- The company\u2019s **trading margins remained stable** (UK 6.2%, International 5.3%), suggesting operational efficiency was maintained despite economic challenges.\n- The **investment in new stores and infrastructure (\u00a33.1bn capital expenditure)** and the expansion of retailing services may temporarily depress ROE as returns on new investments materialize over time.\n- The business is positioned for **long-term growth** internationally and in non-food sectors, with strategic initiatives likely to enhance profitability in the medium term.\n- The **strengthened balance sheet and improved cash flow** provide a solid platform for future growth and potential dividend increases.\n- Given the **global economic recovery signs** and renewed focus on loyalty and customer retention, ROE is expected to stabilize or modestly improve over the next year.\n- For shareholders, the **slight current dip in ROE** should be viewed in the context of ongoing investments and expansion, which bode well for **sustainable returns** and **dividend growth** in the longer term.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE Driver": "- **Asset Turnover** has increased significantly from 4.03 to 4.84, indicating an improvement in **asset efficiency** and better utilization of the company's asset base to generate sales.  \n- This trend suggests that Tesco is managing its assets more effectively, possibly through expansion in sales space, optimization of inventory, or enhanced operational efficiency.  \n- The **Profit Margin** has also shown a modest improvement from 3.98% to 4.09%, reflecting a slight enhancement in the company\u2019s ability to convert sales into net profit.  \n- This increase in margin, although smaller relative to asset turnover growth, still indicates better **cost control**, pricing strategies, or product mix improvements.  \n- Both drivers are contributing positively to **Return on Equity (ROE)**, but the more substantial change in asset turnover suggests it is the dominant factor behind the ROE improvement.  \n- The annual report highlights investments in expanding selling space (new stores and malls internationally), supply chain efficiencies, and cost-saving initiatives (Step Change program), which support the improved asset turnover.  \n- Continued focus on customer loyalty programs and diversified revenue streams (non-food, retailing services, international markets) also underpin margin stability and growth.  \n- The commitment to sustainable growth, innovation, and operational improvements is likely to sustain or further enhance asset turnover in the near term.  \n- Profit margins may see moderate growth as inflationary pressures ease, and Tesco leverages its scale and efficiency gains.  \n- Overall, Tesco appears to be strengthening its ROE drivers, with asset efficiency playing a key role, supported by steady profitability improvements expected in the next quarter and year.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of Risk": "- **Gearing ratio** has improved from 2.35 to 1.90, indicating **reduced financial leverage** and lower reliance on debt, which reduces financial risk.\n- **Current and quick ratios** have slightly decreased (current: 0.75 to 0.73; quick: 0.28 to 0.27), suggesting a marginal decline in **short-term liquidity**, but levels remain relatively stable.\n- **NLP financial risk score** dropped significantly from 0.83 to 0.54, reflecting a **lower perception of financial risk** in the detailed risk disclosures.\n- **NLP legal risk** remains steady at 0.50, indicating **consistent legal risk exposure** without major changes.\n- **NLP tax risk** decreased from 0.86 to 0.74, signaling a **reduction in perceived tax-related uncertainties**.\n- **NLP specificity** improved from 0.069 to 0.087, showing **greater detail and precision** in risk disclosures, enhancing transparency.\n- **NLP sentence length** rose slightly (26.1 to 27.0 words), and **sentence depth** decreased marginally (6.59 to 6.49), suggesting a subtle shift towards **slightly longer but less complex sentence structures**.\n- These linguistic changes imply **improved clarity and readability**, likely aiding investor comprehension.\n- Key risk factors such as **financial leverage and tax risk have diminished**, while **legal risk remains stable**, reflecting effective risk management.\n- Overall, the company\u2019s **risk profile shows improvement with enhanced transparency**, signaling to investors a more stable outlook with manageable risks likely to ease further in the medium term.",
      "summary": "- The company\u2019s **Return on Equity (ROE)** slightly declined from **16.7% to 15.9%**, reflecting a modest reduction in profitability relative to shareholders\u2019 equity, primarily due to increased equity base from retained earnings and investments.  \n- Despite this, **profit before tax increased** from \u00a32.917bn to \u00a33.176bn, and **trading margins remained stable** at UK 6.2% and International 5.3%, signaling maintained operational efficiency.  \n- Significant **capital expenditure (\u00a33.1bn)** in new stores and infrastructure is expected to depress ROE temporarily but supports long-term growth prospects.  \n- **Asset turnover improved markedly** (4.03 to 4.84), demonstrating enhanced **asset utilization** and sales generation efficiency, while **profit margin increased modestly** from 3.98% to 4.09%, showing better cost control and pricing strategy.  \n- The strengthened **balance sheet** is evident in the improved **gearing ratio** (2.35 to 1.90), indicating reduced financial leverage and lower financial risk.  \n- Short-term liquidity ratios (**current and quick ratios**) showed slight declines but remain stable, posing no immediate liquidity concerns.  \n- The company\u2019s **risk profile improved**, with a lower **NLP financial risk score (0.83 to 0.54)** and reduced **tax risk**, while **legal risk remained stable**.  \n- Enhanced **reporting quality** is reflected in increased NLP specificity and improved clarity, aiding better investor understanding and transparency.  \n- The company\u2019s strategic focus on **international expansion, non-food sectors, and customer loyalty** underpins expectations for ROE stabilization and dividend growth in the medium term.  \n- Overall, Tesco presents a solid platform for sustainable growth with **strengthened profitability drivers, risk management, and financial stability** supporting positive investor outlooks."

Thailand - and for the first time we now have more Clubcard holders internationally than in the UK. It has been another significant year for our work on the environment and within local communities. As we grow, our customers increasingly look to Tesco to take the lead in these areas - and we are. In January, we opened the world's first zero-carbon store at Ramsey in Cambridgeshire - the latest step in our journey to reduce the carbon footprint of our business. Over the past year we have made significant progress towards our long-term goals by reducing our emissions by 7.8% on our baseline 2006 7 store and distribution portfolio. This year we donated over PS60m to charities - once again exceeding our target to give the equivalent of 1% of our profits to good causes. These good results are testament to the hard work of our people. The Tesco team is now 472,000 strong - and we remain united by our goal to improve the shopping trip for our customers. I would like to thank all our people for their hard work which I know will continue in the year ahead. David Reid Chairman I am pleased to report that the Tesco team has once again delivered a good set of results - guided by experienced management who have steered the business through recessions before. As markets around the world are emerging from this recession each part of our business is well positioned to pursue our strategy for growth. We have continued to grow sales, profits and market share over the past year. We'five also significantly strengthened our balance sheet. Our acquisition in South Korea is performing well and delivering excellent results, we'five opened our first three Tesco Lifespace shopping malls in China and we have made good progress building the infrastructure and developing new products for Tesco Bank. I am also pleased to announce that we again increased our dividend - for the 26th consecutive year. This consistent track record of delivering dividend growth for shareholders is unrivalled in the FTSE 100. The strong Group results over the last year have been achieved through a constant focus on what matters most to customers in challenging times around the world. A good example of this has been our renewed focus on rewarding loyalty - at home and abroad - which has been a great success with customers. In the UK, we increased our Clubcard investment with Double Points - giving customers even greater reward for their loyalty. Internationally, we launched Clubcard in three more countries during the year - in Poland, Slovakia and 2 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 A growth busi 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 2010 472 237 People 000s 472,000 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 2010 94 28 International UK Sales area m sq ft 94m sq ft Overview T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 3 Our position amongst the leading global retailers hasn't happened by chance.

Our flexible range of formats helps us to adapt our approach to local customers - wherever they are - from Extra hypermarkets to Express convenience stores. We'five learnt how to be 'local': in South Korea, our largest international business, we have over 22,000 employees and just six UK expats. Customers expect to be able to shop where and when they want - as well as having great stores we're the most profitable online grocery retailer in the world.

And we're making good progress already. We're delivering for all stakeholders: an improved shopping trip for customers: training and good careers for our staff: growth and innovation with our suppliers: in local communities we're supporting causes that matter to customers: and we're delivering good returns to shareholders. Looking forward The outlook for shareholder returns is encouraging: we have a strong core UK business growing well: our international businesses offer significant upside from recovery in the short term and maturity in the longer term: our balance sheet is strengthening: and we're creating value through good property development. Our positions in high-growth international economies and non-food meant we were always likely to face strong headwinds during the recession but it will be these parts of our business which will grow fastest in the recovery and beyond. I am confident that with the prospect of an improving global economy and recent investments in acquisitions and new selling space making a greater contribution going forward, returns will improve significantly - starting this year. Sir Terry Leahy Chief Executive Each element of our strategy - UK, International, Non-food, Retailing Services and Community - is stronger now than this time last year. In International, our businesses have made good progress in a challenging global economic environment. Our strategy is working - we'five grown sales, profits and market shares and we'five continued to invest in the drivers of future growth. Our performance in Asia was particularly pleasing, our business in Europe held up well despite the obvious economic challenges and I believe the start-up losses in our US business will now begin to reduce as Fresh & Easy establishes itself. Our UK business had a good year. By remaining focused on helping customers spend less and encouraging loyalty with an increased investment in Clubcard, our UK business has delivered a solid performance. In our core grocery operations, we're growing ahead of the industry as a whole and we have been less affected by falling inflation than the market at large. In Non-food we have made good progress. In the UK we achieved a particularly strong performance in electricals, entertainment and toys. Our clothing range is becoming an international success, led by our F&F range which is growing rapidly in our European markets and this year was launched in four countries in Asia. Our Retailing Services have grown sales and profits once again. We'five also been building the platforms for future growth, particularly in Tesco Bank, which is making good progress in developing its own systems and people capabilities as well as working on a broader product range as it moves towards becoming a fullservice retail bank. In the same way that we'five stuck to our strategy in other parts of the business, we'five also remained committed to our work on Community and the environment. In October, we set ourselves three challenging longterm targets: to become a zero-carbon This year's results show another solid performance from across the Group. By staying focused on doing the right thing for customers we have weathered the economic storm well. And by remaining committed to our longterm strategy we are emerging from recession stronger - with good building blocks in place for future growth. Our business Core UK Non-food Retailing Services International Community T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 9 Our strategy Our well-established and consistent strategy for growth has given the business momentum to grow through the downturn. Business Review This Business Review analyses the performance of the Tesco Group in the financial year ended 27 February 2010. It also explains other aspects of the Group's markets, results and operations, including strategy and risk management. The Directors present their Annual Report to shareholders on the affairs of the Group and Company, together with the audited financial statements of the Company for the 52 weeks ended 27 February 2010. Long-term strategy Tesco has a well-established and consistent strategy for growth. The rationale for the strategy is to broaden the scope of the business to enable it to deliver strong, sustainable long-term growth by following customers into large expanding markets at home - such as financial services, non-food and telecoms - and new markets abroad, initially in Central Europe and Asia and more recently in the United States. The strategy has five elements, reflecting our four established areas of focus plus Tesco's commitments on community and the environment: to be a successful international retailer: to grow the core UK business: to be as strong in non-food as in food: to develop retailing services: and to put community at the heart of what we do. The strategy to diversify the business has been the foundation of Tesco's growth in recent years. It was laid down in 1997, with the fifth element - Community - being added in 2007. Many of the new businesses that have been created and developed over the last 13 years as part of this strategy are now of significant scale and highly profitable - in fact we are now market leader in many of our markets outside the UK. In 1997 our International business generated 1.8% of the Group's profits and we had only just entered the Retailing Services markets: today these parts of our business represent 22% and 16% of profits respectively. Importantly, the strategy has given the business momentum to grow well through the economic downturn. By continuing to invest through the recession - in the customer offer, in infrastructure and in our people - we are now well placed to grow faster and improve shareholder returns as the global economic environment improves. 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Countries China Czech Republic Hungary India Japan Malaysia Poland Republic of Ireland Slovakia South Korea Thailand Turkey United States International at a glance Our international business has delivered a strong performance despite many of our markets feeling the impact of the global recession.

We are partnering with investors to share the capital commitment on some of these projects, enabling us to roll out more sites faster. International Delivering great value for customers on the quality and resilience of our assets and local management teams and strengthens our confidence in our international strategy and long-term growth prospects. Asia We have delivered a strong performance in Asia despite challenging economic conditions in the region. We have grown sales and profits well - driven by new space and the excellent performance of the stores acquired in South Korea in 2008, which are now profitable. As economies generally in Asia start to recover we are seeing improving sales trends in all our businesses except Japan, where economic conditions remain subdued, with overall like-forlike sales for Asia turning positive in the fourth quarter. Profits in Asia grew by 24% with margins strengthening significantly in the second half 6.1% compared to 4.3% in the first half. In International we have delivered a resilient performance in the face of challenging economic headwinds. Our businesses have made good progress - delivering for customers today and at the same time investing in the drivers of future growth. Our strategy is working - and we ended this year stronger than we started it. Each of our businesses has adapted itself to the demands of its local market - with strong local management teams finding ways to lower costs and deliver great value for customers. Increasingly our international businesses are also utilising the scale and skill of the Tesco Group - with more international sourcing, Discount Brands now in seven markets, F&F clothing now in ten countries, Clubcard introduced in seven countries with more Clubcard holders internationally than in the UK - and the Tesco Operating Model sharing our global best practice to the benefit of all our businesses. After a very tough first half of the year we are now seeing encouraging sales trends across almost all our markets: we saw strong improvements in likefor-like sales in the fourth quarter compared to the third. With clear signs that our international markets are starting to recover we are planning to resume a faster pace of new space opening in the coming year. In 2009 10 we opened 5.1m sq ft of new space and in 2010 11 we will open 8.5m sq ft in addition to nine shopping malls in China. The performance of our International businesses through this severe recession has provided reassurance Our Asian markets offer a significant long-term opportunity. We have continued to invest through the downturn to ensure that we will be in an even stronger position as the economies recover. This year we opened 3.0m sq ft of new space across the region - an increase of more than 10% - and we plan to open 4.9m sq ft next year excluding shopping malls. We have also continued to make good progress towards developing a strong brand in our most developed Asian markets with further expansion of Clubcard and our Retailing Services businesses. The size and scale of China provides unique challenges for a retailer but also offers a huge opportunity for a business prepared to show flexibility and vision. Our strategy is to expand into less developed second and third tier cities by opening hypermarkets in leading shopping malls. We'five found it hard to find locations with the right facilities in some cities - giving us an opportunity to develop our own malls, to ensure they are the right size, location and design to meet the needs of the new Chinese consumer. During the year we opened our first three Tesco Lifespace shopping malls in Fushun pictured, Qingdao and Qinhuangdao and we will open nine more this year. Each mall comprises approximately 500,000 sq ft of retail space over five floors and is a one-stop 12 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 International continued Investing in the drivers of future growth Watch the video: www. com tescoworksforme Throughout the year we opened 63 new stores in South Korea, bringing our total number of stores to 305 South Korea Homeplus in South Korea delivered another very good performance this year with total sales growth of 33% including 3% on a like-for-like basis and profits up more than 50%. The integration of the former Homever stores has been completed successfully, ahead of plan, with the stores now trading profitably with double-digit like-for-like sales growth in the fourth quarter. South Korea also opened 63 new stores in the year. The acquisition in 2008 has helped Homeplus grow its market share and close the gap with the market leader. We opened our first franchise store in February 2010 with more scheduled to open in this financial year. South Korea is our largest international business with sales of PS4.5bn and profits of almost PS300m. Thailand Tesco Lotus in Thailand has delivered a good performance - despite a background of continued political uncertainty - with double-digit profit growth on a constant exchange rate basis. A strong store opening programme has helped drive our sales growth this year in a market in which we remain the clear market leader. Strong productivity gains have enabled us to make significant investments in lowering prices for customers whilst still delivering good margins and positive cash flow. The launch of Clubcard in August 2009 marked a new stage in the development of our business and take-up from customers has been excellent, with four million customers signed up so far. China In China, we are laying the foundations for long-term growth, with further investments in new stores, supply chain infrastructure and management. We have focused on three regions - each with its own management team - and with a focus on expansion into second and third tier cities. We opened 17 hypermarkets in the year, including in our first three Lifespace shopping centre developments in Fushun, Qingdao and Qinhuangdao, with average tenant occupancy over 80% at opening. We plan to open 23 hypermarkets in 2010 11 of which nine will be in new Lifespace malls. The mall development programme will be funded in part through joint ventures with third-party investors. The first such joint venture - incorporating three malls - was established in November 2009 with a syndicate of leading Asian investors. Malaysia Our business in Malaysia made good progress with sales growing 9% this year - increasing our market share. We continue to invest in Clubcard with more than one million customers signed up and with a dunnhumby team working with us locally to provide insight on pricing, range and promotions. We grew our space by 11% this year but with the economy starting to show signs of recovery we plan to step this up to 27% growth in 2010 11. Japan In our 2008 9 Annual Report, we stated that with the challenging market conditions in Japan, we had only limited headroom on the carrying value of our Japan assets. Given the further deterioration in the retail market, it became appropriate to make impairments against the goodwill arising on the acquisition we made to enter the market in 2003, resulting in a PS131m charge to the income statement PS82m in the first half and PS49m in the second half. Our team in Japan continues to make good progress in developing the business. Our new convenience format is receiving good feedback from customers who like the focus on fresh food and new features helping us to differentiate our offer, such as the in-store bakery, an extensive wine range and our first 400 own-label products - which after only a few months already account for 10% of sales. India Our early plans in India are progressing well. Our local management team is helping our franchise partner, Trent, to develop its Star Bazaar hypermarket operation which is currently achieving like-for-like sales of c. 40% and buys more than 70% of its products from Tesco's wholesale business. Plans for our cash and carry business are also on track with our first store expected to open towards the end of this year.

Ji Tesco customer Shanghai, China 14 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 International continued Our flagship My Narodni department store in Prague reopened in September 2009 after a major refit Europe Europe overall delivered a robust performance against strong economic headwinds in the form of a sharp downturn in economic activity causing a slow-down in customer expenditure. Sales growth varied across the region with a good contribution from new space helping sales grow in Poland and Turkey and stay stable in the Czech Republic and Hungary. Significant price deflation and cross-border shopping driven by rapid movements in exchange rates resulted in sales declining in Slovakia and Ireland. Overall, however, the sales trends are now improving: each of our European businesses showed an improvement in like-for-like sales growth in the fourth quarter. We have made market share gains across our Central European markets by reducing costs and lowering prices for customers and by continuing to invest in new space. Profitability in the region as a whole declined slightly compared with last year but was resilient given the severity of recession. We are continuing to invest in the region, opening 1.8m sq ft of new space during the year - less than originally expected, primarily as a result of the economic environment. With the outlook improving we will be stepping up the rate of opening with a plan to add 3.1m sq ft of new space across the region in 2010 11. Republic of Ireland In Ireland we have made substantial changes to our business, which was facing the dual challenge of a severe recession and cross-border trading. By integrating more of our international brand buying with our UK business we have been able to reduce the prices of 12,500 products by an average of around 20%. Customers are responding enthusiastically to our improved pricing and range: significant uplifts in volumes have now offset the impact of lower prices, resulting in positive like-for-like sales growth in the last few weeks of the year and a growing market share. These changes, combined with a substantial cost reduction programme, have enabled Tesco Ireland to deliver a steady financial performance despite the economic headwinds and significant self-imposed price deflation. The cost of the exceptional restructuring activities was PS33m in total for the year. Hungary Our business in Hungary continues to perform well - with sales levels being maintained despite a very weak economy in which unemployment levels increased by more than 25% and consumers were hit with a 5% increase in sales tax. We are continuing to execute our strategy of investing in the shopping trip for customers, helping our overall market share to grow again in the last year, further consolidating our market leadership. Poland In Poland, we have had another good year with strong growth in sales and profits on a constant exchange rate basis. A good performance from the converted Leader Price stores, the popularity of our Discount Brands - now in one in three baskets - and our clothing range, which achieved like-for-like sales growth of more than 20%, have helped our business maintain positive ex-petrol like-forlike sales growth overall. The launch of Clubcard in August 2009 has been very well received, with 1.8 million customers signing up so far. Czech Republic In the Czech Republic our strong new store opening programme has helped us maintain sales at levels similar to last year and improve our share of a market affected by high unemployment and price deflation. Our Express and 10,000 sq ft format stores continue to do well with positive like-for-like sales growth, but as in most markets, growth in the larger stores remains subdued as customers curtail their spending on non-food in the current environment. The outstanding category in nonfood has been clothing with doubledigit sales growth. Our flagship My Narodni department store in Prague was reopened after a major refit project and we are pleased with the results to date. The first T esco outside the UK opened just 15 years ago - in Hungary With growing sales and improvements in productivity, waste and distribution costs, store economics are improving steadily. Overall trading losses were in line with guidance provided last year and reflect the fact that Fresh & Easy has been built with the infrastructure to support hundreds of stores. We expect to open new stores at a rate of around one per week this year with a focus on areas where the local economy has been less severely hit and where we are seeing substantially stronger sales performance. One of the benefits of the downturn is a slightly softer property market: we are now able to buy more freehold properties and the overall cost of building a store has fallen by approximately 20%. A combination of new space and organic sales growth means that sales growth this year will be more than 50%. Although we do not expect losses to be much lower in 2010 11 we believe they have now peaked. T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 15 Our business 145 Fresh & Easy stores by end of 2009 10 Asia 1,230 Europe 954 US 145 International stores Slovakia In Slovakia, the overall retail market has been very challenging with rising unemployment and sharp falls in industrial output. Cross-border shopping remained significant for much of the first half but abated in the second half after we reduced our prices within Slovakia to bring them more closely into line with neighbouring countries. Like-for-like sales growth is recovering strongly: from negative double digit for the first half to positive growth in the final few weeks of the year. A good store opening programme combined with investments in the shopping trip and customer loyalty - with Clubcard launching in Slovakia in September 2009 - have helped us extend our market-leading position further during the year. We have recently refitted and rebranded one of our large hypermarkets in Bratislava as an 'Extra' adding new departments such as pharmacy, photo processing, opticians and phone shop. This is the first of its type in Central Europe. Turkey In Turkey, whilst we slowed our rate of new store growth, it remained strong enough to offset the like-forlike sales decline, helping us to grow overall sales during the year. With the economy showing early signs of recovery we are planning to resume a faster rate of expansion this year. Turkey remains an important strategic long-term opportunity for us as a large, growing and relatively underdeveloped retail market. United States In the United States, Fresh & Easy has been making good progress, despite prolonged weakness in the California, Nevada and Arizona economies. Customers are enthusiastic about our range, particularly the fresh food prepared in the Fresh & Easy kitchen, the store environment and the friendly service. As with any of our new businesses, we are adapting and improving our offer in response to customer feedback. During the year we'five broadened the range in some key categories - like cereals and pet food - and added larger pack sizes for families. We have also introduced a range of lower-priced house brands to help families on a budget. With the improvements to our range implemented and with the number of stores growing 145 stores by end of 2009 10, we launched media campaigns - in September 2009 and January 2010 - focusing on how Fresh & Easy can offer both high quality and low prices. A combination of increased customer awareness and the improvements we have made instore helped to drive stronger positive like-for-like sales growth in the second half of the year. 16 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Core UK at a glance Our market-leading UK business has continued to grow well by helping customers to spend less during the downturn. Clubcard - 15 years of loyalty Clubcard is our unique way of saying thank you to our customers for shopping with us. Launched in 1995, Clubcard now has 15 million active members in the UK. Clubcard not only rewards our customers for their loyalty, but it also provides us with valuable insight into changing shopping patterns. By monitoring this data and spotting trends early we're able to respond quickly and ensure that we're always providing customers with what they want, when and where they want it. This year Clubcard became even more rewarding. By increasing our investment with Double Points, customers earned PS550m in total in vouchers. Double Points has encouraged more customers to sign up, a Clubcard is now used with a higher proportion of transactions than before and 18% more UK households are redeeming vouchers than a year ago. The knowledge and expertise of operating Clubcard - combined with insight and analysis from dunnhumby - is now being adopted across our international businesses. We now have Clubcard in seven of our international markets - in fact we now have more Clubcard holders overseas than in the UK.

T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 17 Our business Core UK Sustainable profitable growth Based on our dotcom picking availability measure. Our UK business delivered a solid performance in competitive market conditions. We are growing faster than the industry as a whole and we have achieved this by remaining focused - as always - on customers. Our strategy of earning their loyalty by helping them to spend less - with low prices and affordable new products such as the Discount Brands - deflated sales growth initially but it was the right thing to do for customers. By encouraging and rewarding loyalty - through an increased investment in Clubcard - we have maintained steadier sales growth during the year than the industry as a whole, which has seen a significant slowdown with the steep decline in inflation. Excluding petrol and adjusting for VAT, like-for-like sales were 3.7% in the first half and 2.7% in the second half, driven by a strong volume performance. Achieving our target of opening 2m sq ft of new space during the year ensured that sales from new space made a good contribution to total sales growth, which was 6.5% for the first half and 5.7% for the second half excluding petrol and adjusted for VAT. Delivering for customers through recession is not just about lowering prices and offering great promotions: it's about delivering all elements of the shopping trip. Consequently, we have continued to invest in availability, service, range and quality with pleasing results: Availability Availability has improved again this year as a result of a number of initiatives to improve stock management including more efficient ordering systems, a greater focus on clearing promotional and discontinued lines, better in-store monitoring processes and storing stock on the top of shelves on the shop floor rather than in the warehouse. The results have not only increased availability based on our dotcom picking measure and reduced evening gaps in fresh food by 18%, but the resulting reduction in stock across our store network has made a significant contribution to our improved working capital position. Service Service remains a key differentiator. Our one-in-front initiative - where if there is more than one customer queuing at a single checkout we open another - and increased investment in self-service checkouts, which now account for a quarter of all transactions, continue to keep us ahead of the industry on customer measures of checkout service. We trained more than 200,000 staff to help them respond better to customer needs and our 'Every Comment Helps' initiative, which encourages customers to give instant feedback via text or email, has given us the benefit of 60,000 customer comments to help us improve our offer and service. Range Tesco's diverse and adaptable range allows us to offer a wide choice for every customer whatever their budget. Through the recession we have helped customers with lowerpriced ranges such as Discount Brands and Market Value and we have also offered them affordable treats such as the Finest Restaurant Collection ready meals, which have been very popular. We continue to innovate our range with over 2,600 new or improved own-label food lines launched this year. As the economy starts to emerge from recession we are seeing customers buy more from our Finest range, which returned to positive like-for-like sales growth in the year. 2,600 new or improved own-label food lines launched this year 200,000 staff trained in 'Every little helps' skills Watch the video: www. com tescoworksforme 18 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 At Tesco we're constantly striving to make things better, simpler and cheaper. That's why we'five launched three innovative and popular iPhone apps. Customers no longer have to worry about forgetting their Clubcard as our latest app enables them to scan their Clubcard on their iPhone. This app is proving extremely popular with customers with over 200,000 downloads in the first three weeks and there will soon be versions for other smartphones too. Store Finder app enables customers to find their nearest stores and then locate products complete with prices within the store - to the exact aisle. Our wine app allows customers to take a photo of a wine they like and uses image recognition software to identify iPhone apps - making life easier for customers the wine, providing full product information and allowing customers to order from their phone. Coming soon is another tesco. com app which will enable customers to do their tesco. com grocery ordering from their phone. Core UK continued Delivering an 'Every little helps' shopping trip Quality Quality - particularly in fresh food - remains important to customers even in tough times and as we emerge from recession this will become even more important. That's why we have been investing in our fresh food offer with a wide-ranging change programme. Improved technical standards, additional specialist staff training, closer relationships with our suppliers and significant changes to the way we merchandise some key products are helping us deliver a stronger range and better shopping experience for customers. These and other initiatives helped Tesco win the 'Fresh Produce Retailer of the Year' Award in 2009. Step Change Our UK Step Change programme is in its thirteenth year and continues to go from strength to strength. This year we met our PS550m savings target. Step Change is not just about generating savings - each project must be 'better' for customers, 'simpler' for staff and 'cheaper' for Tesco. Our stock reduction programme is an excellent example of this: it's better for customers because it has driven a large improvement in availability for both food and non-food: it's simpler for staff because it is now easier to locate stock to fill the shelves and stock errors can be identified more easily: and it's cheaper for Tesco because stores now hold less stock and fewer hours are needed to replenish the shelves. For example, a typical Tesco Extra now holds 8% less stock and we are now looking at releasing backroom space which can be redeployed for Retailing Services or Non-food. This year we aim to complete a global programme that will deliver savings of PS800m and we'll invest most of these savings back into our offer for customers. New space Through the experience and expertise of our property teams we have developed over a number of years a good pipeline of new space opportunities. As a result we have the opportunity to unwind some of the work-in-progress we have built up and will be stepping up the rate of expansion in 2010 11. We will be investing PS1.6bn of capital in the UK economy this year and will create thousands of jobs for people, including the long-term unemployed through our Regeneration Partnerships. Sustainable strategy Our customer strategy is sustainable for the long term because we can differentiate Tesco in a unique way with Clubcard and because our low prices and improvements to the customer shopping trip are based on permanent productivity gains. Our growth strategy for the UK is also sustainable as it is based on taking a balanced approach to the key building blocks of top-line growth: solid likefor-like performance and a consistent contribution from new stores.

Our first ever purpose-built import storage facility, which opened in Middlesbrough in August, fulfils both these objectives whilst also creating 800 jobs in the local community. The 910,000 sq ft Teesport distribution centre offers a traditional low bay assembly operation and high density storage within a fully automated high bay warehouse providing a capability of holding 160,000 pallets and assembling up to 4.5 million cases per week. The scale of Teesport, along with its port location and on-site rail infrastructure, has helped reduce costs in our T eesport - helping us get better, simpler and cheaper distribution network, which in turn helps us keep prices low for customers. Teesport has also delivered major environmental benefits by removing over 12,000 lorry journeys per year from the UK's roads. This has made a significant step towards our target to halve distribution emissions of each case delivered by 2012, against a baseline of 2006. Sales UK PS9.0bn International PS4.1bn Our non-food performance has been very resilient through the downturn. In some key categories we have made significant market share gains as more customers have been encouraged to try our non-food range in the search for great value and as some competitors have felt the strain. Group non-food sales rose 6.2% to PS13.1bn, with PS9.0bn in the UK and PS4.1bn in International. We delivered a very strong non-food performance in the UK with steadily improving like-for-like sales during the year. A number of categories had particularly strong growth: Electricals With competitive prices, a great range - in-store and online - and over 1,000 Tesco Tech Support advisors in our UK stores to help customers make their choice, we are rapidly growing our presence in the electricals market. We now sell one in every six microwaves in the UK and one in four small-screen TVs. Our sales in electricals have doubled in the last four years and around 20% are online. Entertainment Our market share in games has doubled in the last year as a result of allocating it more space in-store, revamping the range and layout and being more competitive on new releases. As part of our drive to lower prices for customers, we make every effort to cut out the middlemen and source products from manufacturers or developers. For example, we teamed up with DreamWorks studio for the exclusive rights to sell the short animated Christmas film Merry Madagascar. This groundbreaking relationship was the first of its kind in the industry and enabled Tesco to sell over one million Merry Madagascar DVDs. Toys Our sales in toys have grown 25% this year with online sales up more than 60%. Clothing Sales grew by 7.3%, including positive like-for-like growth, to reach PS1bn in sales for the first time, helped by a 15% increase in children's wear and the launch of our online clothing range. We sell 1 in 6 microwaves sold in the UK Tesco works for me... 22 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 \"... everything is in one location - I just bought a washing line\" Sasha with Schmoo Tesco customer Friern Barnet T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 23 Our business Non-food continued Resilient through the downturn Our ambition is to make F&F a leading global fashion brand, offering unbeatable value for money, not compromised by quality, design or provenance. F&F launched in the UK in 2001 and has expanded rapidly since then with sales last year of PS540m in the UK - supported by the launch of our online clothing site in October. F&F launched in Central Europe in 2008 and we're already making excellent progress. F&F is rapidly becoming established in the region with customer awareness of the brand growing from 34% to 61% in the last year. Across our markets in Central Europe, Tesco is already one of the largest clothing retailers. In fact during the year we sold more F&F items - 68 million - than the combined populations of our F&F - a global brand four countries in the region: Poland: Hungary: Czech Republic: and Slovakia. We're now building on the success in the UK and Central Europe to launch F&F across our Asian markets. This year we launched in China, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand. As with any brand, F&F can't afford to stand still, which is why we're broadening the brand's appeal with new ranges - F&F Couture and F&F Jewellery. International clothing Clothing is becoming a global strength and a good example of how we are bringing global scale and skill to our international businesses. In our four Central European markets, clothing like-for-like sales grew 14% this year - following strong growth the previous year - in a market which has been declining overall in the recession. We'five also introduced F&F ranges to four Asian markets this year - another step in developing F&F into a global brand. Joint buying - whereby 95% of the supplier base in Central Europe is the same as Ireland and the UK - has brought the benefits of Group expertise and scale, helping to improve quality and costs. Online Shopping habits are changing - customers want to buy online as well as from stores and catalogues - and many will use a combination of these to research before buying. With an integrated multichannel approach we're making it easy for customers, whichever way they want to shop. In addition to the 15,500 products available online through Tesco Direct, we now have two new specialist websites launched in October: www. t e s c o. c o m c l o t h i n g Our new clothing site combines familiar Tesco labels such as Cherokee and F&F with some new Tesco lines exclusively offered online, plus a number of other brands. The site became one of the top ten most visited clothing websites within weeks of its launch. So far the customer feedback has been very strong, particularly on value for money and ease of shop. com entertainment The launch of Tesco Entertainment brought together, for the first time, our entire physical and digital entertainment offer, in a new and easy-to-use one-stop site. Customers are now able to buy a CD, DVD or game and a film or album download, all in one transaction. From the outset the new website has proved popular with customers. 1,000 Tesco Tech Support advisors in UK stores Watch the video: www. com dunnhumby serves other retailers and manufacturers in 26 international markets 26 24 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Retailing Services at a glance We'five made good progress this year in our Retailing Services businesses: Tesco Bank: tesco. com - a leading online retailer Including both our grocery and non-food offer, tesco. com is one of the largest online retailers in the UK, with sales of more than PS2bn. Just as in our stores, our success comes from listening to customers and a constant drive to ensure that we provide an online 'Every little helps' shopping experience. With more than a million active customers, our online grocery business is the market leader and the most profitable business of its kind in the world. It continues to grow strongly - last year we delivered over one billion items. We have put ease of use at the heart of our online shopping trip - for example, our 'favourites' feature, which makes shopping online easier by using Clubcard to remember a customer's favourite in-store and online purchases. We also continue to innovate with our 'price match' on any substituted products and our 'shorter than we'd like' code life guarantee. Tesco Direct extends the reach of our non-food offer with over 15,500 products available to customers via the internet and catalogues. Customers can choose to have goods delivered to their home or they can pick them up at one of our 261 in-store Direct desks. This year we relaunched our online entertainment site, enabling customers to buy downloads alongside the physical product, and we launched our online clothing website with a range of 2,500 fashionable items, of which 1,000 were exclusively online.

This year we made good progress in attracting new customers and growing sales and profits while at the same time laying the foundations for further growth. Total Retailing Services sales were PS3.6bn, up 4.2% on last year and profits were PS540m, up 17.6%. Tesco Bank Overall, Tesco Bank has delivered a good performance in a challenging retail banking market growing profits by 13% to PS250m. Bad debt levels rose during the year but have now stabilised and throughout have remained below industry averages. We have absorbed additional costs as we begin the process of moving the business onto its own infrastructure and build the team as we prepare the business for faster growth. Commercial performance We grew the number of customer accounts by more than 400,000 in the last year - to a total of more than 6.2 million across all products. We have achieved double-digit customer growth in our banking products, including 27% growth in personal loans. In insurance we held our number of policies broadly flat in a very competitive market: the number of motor insurance policies declined - partly as a result of a planned reduction in our exposure to high-risk drivers - but the number of policies in home, pet and life insurance increased. Our 130 in-store travel bureaux saw an increase in transactions of more than 80% and the number of ATMs in our network grew to over 2,800. Profit Gross profit grew 19% to PS749m with a good performance in banking being partly offset by lower profitability in insurance, primarily as a result of lower investment income linked to the current low interest rate environment. Trading profit was up 13.1% to PS250m compared to PS221m in 2008 9 on a pro forma basis. Profit before tax was PS114m - with the primary deduction from operating profit being the previously announced PS127m noncash amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition. This profit performance was achieved after an increase in operating costs - as a result of the change of ownership as the business prepares for expansion - and against the background of a 32% increase in bad debts - to PS177m which was in part offset by a credit relating to the unwind of the fair value adjustment created on acquisition. Capital and liquidity The Tier 1 capital ratio at the end of 2009 10 was 13.0%. The funding and liquidity position of the business remained robust throughout the period with customer deposits in excess of customer lending. This is further supported by a high-quality liquid asset portfolio, net short-term wholesale cash and investment grade assets worth PS1.3bn. Management team During the year good progress has been made in completing the recruitment of an experienced management team in all areas of the Bank: finance: risk: legal: commercial: treasury: and IT. All senior roles have now been filled. Infrastructure In September 2009 we entered into an agreement with Fortis UK Ltd to help us build the operational platform and technical expertise required to further develop our insurance business. We have also selected the core technology platforms for the banking products. The migration programmes for both sides of the business are progressing well and we expect to be writing business on the new systems by the end of 2010 11. We have secured new premises for banking and insurance operations in Glasgow and Newcastle, which will open in mid 2010, creating 1,800 jobs. New product development Subject to regulatory approval we anticipate launching new savings products and mortgages by the end of financial year 2010 11, with current accounts to follow in the second half of 2011. 6.2 million Tesco Bank customers Double-digit customer growth in our banking products 26 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Retailing Services continued Growing sales and profits tesco. com Our online businesses - including dotcom grocery and Direct - delivered another strong performance, achieving a 14% increase in sales with profits rising 26% to PS136m. In a little over a decade we have built a substantial profitable business that has sales of PS2.1bn and employs 20,000 people. Our website is the third most visited retail website in the UK and last year our online grocery business delivered over a billion items. The number of active customers in our online grocery business has grown to over one million and basket size has increased. Record levels of availability and innovations such as price matching on substitutions are improving the customer experience and helping to reduce the number of lapsed customers and calls to the service centre. We are reducing costs and carbon emissions by improving fuel consumption per order by 10% for the second year running through implementing new technology to improve driving and routing efficiency. Tesco Direct extends the reach of our non-food offer to customers via the internet, by phone and catalogues. Customers can choose to have goods delivered to their home or they can pick them up at one of our 261 instore Direct desks. Tesco Direct had another good year making good progress on its customer service offer, growing sales by 28% and continuing on its path towards profitability. Tesco Telecoms Profit from our telecoms business grew, driven primarily by Tesco Mobile, which achieved a 14% increase in customer numbers - to more than two million - in a declining pre-pay phone market. Tesco Mobile also successfully entered the 'pay monthly' market this year with innovative tariffs and generous credit rewards, picking up the 'best tariff' accolade at the 2009 Mobile Choice Awards. Tesco Mobile remained the number one pay-as-you-go operator for customer satisfaction throughout 2009. In December 2009, Tesco Mobile broadend its appeal further by becoming only the third UK operator to offer the iPhone, for which sales have been encouraging. We have made good progress in rolling out our in-store Phone Shops with 105 open at year end and a further 100 planned by the end of this year. The Phone Shops are transforming our ability to sell products that require an assisted sale - particularly contract mobile phones. Also in 2009 we signed a wholesale broadband agreement with Cable & Wireless, which will enable us to relaunch our broadband offer to customers in 2010 with higher bandwidth speeds and lower prices. dunnhumby This year marks dunnhumby's 20th anniversary. In addition to supporting Tesco's Clubcard in seven countries around the world, dunnhumby serves other retailers and manufacturers in 26 international markets: in fact Tesco now represents only around 15% of its sales. dunnhumby is growing fast - with profits up 28% in the year - helped by new engagements in the United States Macy's, Canada Metro and Colombia Exito. dunnhumby now touches the lives of over 350 million consumers through its client relationships. 1 for customer satisfaction Source: Customer Service Index Watch the video: www. com tescoworksforme T elecoms T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 27 Our business \"...

This unites the Group's resources and in particular focuses the efforts of our staff around our customers, people, operations, finance and the community. Its prime focus is as a management tool for the Company so that there is appropriate balance in the tradeoffs that need to be made between the main levers of management - such as operations measures, financial measures or delivery of customer metrics. It therefore enables the business to be operated and monitored on a balanced basis with due regard to the needs of all stakeholders. For the owners of the business, it is simply based around the philosophy that if we look after customers and staff well and operate efficiently and effectively then shareholders' interests will always be best served by the inevitable outputs of those - growth in sales, profits and returns. 2010 2009 2008 Sales growth Change in Group sales over the year including value added tax 6.8% 15.1% 11.1% UK sales growth 4.2% 9.5% 6.7% International sales growth 8.8% 30.6% 25.3% International sales growth at constant exchange rates 6.6% 13.6% 22.5% Retailing Services sales growth 4.2% 11% - Profit before tax PS3,176m PS2,917m PS2,803m Underlying profit before tax PS3,395m PS3,124m PS2,846m Trading margin UK trading margin 6.2% 6.2% 5.9% International trading margin excluding the United States 5.3% 5.3% 5.6% Trading margin is calculated from the trading profit expressed as a percentage of Group revenue sales excluding value added tax and excluding the impact of IFRIC 13. It is a measure of profit generation from sales and is a comparable performance measure with other companies. This is how much we made from trade in our stores, taking account of the cost of the products sold, wages and salaries, expenses associated with running the stores, depots and head office, and the cost of depreciation of the assets used to generate the profits. Trading profit is stated after adjusting operating profit for the impact of IAS 19, IAS 32 and IAS 39 principally pension costs and the marking to market of financial instruments. It also excludes the non-cash elements of IAS 17 'Leases', relating to the impact of annual uplifts in rents and rent-free periods, and the IFRS 3 amortisation charge on intangible assets arising on the acquisition of Tesco Personal Finance TPF.

We monitor a wide range of KPIs, both financial and non-financial. Individual business units have their own versions of the Steering Wheel which incorporate their own priorities and KPIs. Some of the Group KPIs below are tracked through the Steering Wheel and those above are tracked as a monitor of investor return. Across the Group, KPIs are set for local markets, with oversight from the Executive Directors, to ensure they are tailored to drive the priorities of each business. The following are some KPIs for the UK and Group operations: 2010 2009 2008 UK market share Grocery market share 22.5% 22.2% 21.8% New non-food market share 4.1% 3.6% 3.5% Employee retention 90% 87% 84% This measure shows the percentage of employees who have stayed with the business for longer than one year.

T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 41 Our business Risks and uncertainties Introduction Risk is an accepted part of doing business. The real challenge for any business is to identify the principal risks it faces and to develop and monitor appropriate controls. A successful risk management process balances risks and rewards and relies on a sound judgement of their likelihood and consequence. The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and internal control within the context of achieving the Group's objectives. Our process for identifying and managing risks is set out in more detail from page 49 of the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report and Financial Statements. The key risks faced by the Group and relevant mitigating factors are set out below. Business strategy If our strategy follows the wrong direction or is not effectively communicated then the business may suffer. We need to understand and properly manage strategic risk in order to deliver long-term growth for the benefit of all our stakeholders. Our strategy is based on five elements: to become a successful international retailer, to grow the core UK business, be as strong in non-food as in food, develop retailing services and put the community at the heart of what we do. Pursuit of this five-part strategy has allowed the business to diversify and, at a strategic level, diversification and pursuit of growth in emerging markets have the effect of reducing overall risk by avoiding reliance on a small number of business areas. However, by its very nature, diversification also introduces new risks to be managed in areas of the business that are less mature and less fully understood. To ensure the Group continues to pursue the right strategy, the Board discusses strategic issues at every Board meeting and dedicates two full days a year to reviewing the Group's strategy. The Executive Committee also discusses strategy on a regular basis. We have structured programmes for engaging with all our stakeholders including customers, employees, investors, suppliers, government, media and non-governmental organisations. We also invest significant resources in ensuring our strategy is communicated well and understood by the parties who are key to delivering it. The business operates a Steering Wheel a balanced scorecard process whereby we set goals for different areas of the business and assess our overall progress on a quarterly basis in all countries and significant business units to help manage performance and deliver business strategy. Financial strategy and Group treasury risk The main financial risks of the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. The risks associated with operating Tesco Bank are covered under Financial services risks below. The Treasury function is mandated by the Board to manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs. The function has clear policies and operating parameters, and its activities are routinely reviewed and audited. The function does not operate as a profit centre and the undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted. A description of the role of the Finance Committee, Internal Audit and External Audit is set out in the Corporate Governance section on page 50. Financial services risks Through Tesco Bank, the Group is subject to certain risks relating to the personal financial services industry in the UK. Tesco Bank is subject to significant legislative and regulatory oversight. In particular, Tesco Bank is subject to supervision by the Financial Services Authority FSA which has substantial powers of intervention and requires it to satisfy certain capital adequacy and liquidity ratios. If Tesco Bank is unable to or fails to satisfy these ratios in the future it could lose its licence and, consequently, its ability to transact business. Tesco Bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesco on 19 December 2008. In preparation for this change its risk management and treasury capabilities were materially strengthened. All policies pertaining to risk within the Bank are now subject to Tesco Bank specific governance procedures which are owned by the Tesco Bank Board. Tesco Bank has a banking business, predominantly in the UK, with the three main products being credit cards, unsecured personal loans and savings. It has also developed a significant insurance business, with motor, home and pet insurance being the main products. Tesco Bank is subject to various risks associated with the provision of financial services. In relation to its insurance business Tesco Bank may experience a concentration of risks from natural or man-made disasters. In addition market conditions may not allow it to purchase the amount of re-insurance it considers necessary on terms it considers acceptable. Actual claims may exceed the claims provisions that have been made on the basis of past experience. Tesco Bank's credit card receivables and personal loan portfolio may be subject to changes in credit quality, due to a general deterioration in economic conditions or to failures in its credit assessment process, which could adversely impact its ability to recover amounts due. Furthermore, there is significant competition in the financial services industry which could adversely affect Tesco Bank's profitability. Legal developments, changes in legal interpretation or precedent and changes in public policy may result in new risks emerging in addition to those anticipated. Tesco Bank is in the process of building new banking and insurance systems and until these are complete there is an increased element of operational risk as most operations are outsourced to Royal Bank of Scotland. Tesco Bank retains the risk to its insurance activities posed by external factors, such as a large weather-related event. Tesco Bank is an FSA-regulated entity and so its treasury function is run independently from the rest of the Group. Tesco Bank's treasury risks include liquidity risk and interest rate risk in particular, in the interest rate margin realised between lending and borrowing costs. Tesco Bank is also subject to the risk of unexpected losses arising from operational failure, whether as a result of human error, systems failures, fraud or inadequate controls. Tesco Bank monitors these risks through its governance structures, assessing any potential impact and action required to manage them. The work of the Risk Committee focuses on systemic risks such as funding, credit risk and risks in the insurance business, while the Tesco Bank Audit Committee considers internal controls and assurance. Operational threats and performance risk in the business There is a risk that our business may not deliver the stated strategy in full, particularly since, like all retailers, the business is susceptible to economic downturn that could affect consumer spending. The continuing acquisition and development of property sites also forms an intrinsic part of our strategy and this carries inherent risks. 42 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Risks and uncertainties continued We aim to deliver what customers want better than our competitors by understanding and responding to their needs. All of our business units have stretching targets based on the Steering Wheel and the performance of business units is monitored continually and reported regularly to the Board. We manage the acquisition and development of our property assets carefully. We consider and assess in detail every site at each stage of acquisition and development and ensure that relevant action is taken to minimise any risks. Competition and consolidation The retail industry is highly competitive. The Group competes with a wide variety of retailers of varying sizes and faces increased competition from UK retailers as well as international operators in the UK and overseas. Failure to compete with competitors on areas including price, product range, quality and service could have an adverse effect on the Group's financial results. We aim to have a broad appeal on price, range and store format in a way that allows us to compete in different markets. We track performance against a range of measures that customers tell us are critical to their shopping trip experience and we constantly monitor customer perceptions of ourselves and our competitors to ensure we can respond quickly if we need to. People capabilities Employees are our greatest asset. It is critical to our success to attract, retain, develop and motivate the best people with the right capabilities at all levels of operations. We review our people policies regularly and are committed to investing in training and development and incentives for our people. Our 'Talent Planning' process helps individuals achieve their full potential. We also carry out succession planning to ensure that the future needs of the business are considered and provided for. There are clear processes for understanding and responding to employees' needs through our People Matters Group, staff surveys, regular performance reviews, involvement of trade unions in relevant markets and regular communication of business developments. We take a proactive approach to encouraging diversity at all levels within the business. Reputational risk As the largest retailer in the UK, expectations of the Group are high. Failure to protect the Group's reputation and brand could lead to a loss of trust and confidence. This could result in a decline in the customer base and affect the ability to recruit and retain good people. Like other companies we must consider potential threats to our reputation and the consequences of reputational damage. Emotional loyalty to the Tesco brand has helped us diversify into new areas like retail services and non-food and we recognise the commercial imperative to do the right thing for all our stakeholders and avoid the loss of such loyalty. The Tesco Values are embedded in the way we do business at every level and our Group Code of Business Conduct guides our behaviour in our dealings with customers, employees and suppliers. We engage with stakeholders in every sphere to take into account their views and we try to ensure our strategy reflects them. Since the launch of the Community Plan in 2006 we have demonstrated our commitment to tackling a wide range of societal and environmental issues. We have high level committees, including the Executive Committee, Corporate Responsibility Committee and Group Compliance Committee to help guide and monitor our policies. Environmental risks The main environmental risk we face is the threat of climate change and it is essential that we work to mitigate it through energy efficiency, the sustainable management of other resources and waste minimisation. We engage with key stakeholders and experts in developing environmental policy, including through the Sustainable Consumption Institute we have endowed at Manchester University. Environmental strategy and policies are reviewed regularly by the Corporate Responsibility Committee. Our climate change strategy is driven by a belief that proactive environmental performance will be rewarded by consumers and that providing the means by which consumers can adopt low-carbon lifestyles will increasingly be a route to competitive advantage. Product safety The safety and quality of our products is of paramount importance to Tesco as well as being essential for maintaining customer trust and confidence. A breach of confidence could affect the size of our customer base and hence financial results. We have detailed and established procedures for ensuring product integrity at all times, especially for our own-label products. There are strict product safety processes and regular management reports. We work in partnership with suppliers to ensure mutual understanding of the standards required. We also monitor developments in areas such as health, safety and nutrition in order to respond appropriately to changing customer trends and new legislation. We have clear processes for crisis management, pulling together expert teams should we need to respond quickly on issues. Health and safety risks The safety of our staff and customers is of the utmost importance to us. If we are unable to provide safe environments for our staff and customers this could lead to injuries or loss of life. We operate stringent health and safety processes in line with best practice in our stores, distribution centres and offices which are monitored and audited regularly. KPIs for health and safety help prevent incidents and form an intrinsic part of our Steering Wheel across the business. Performance against these KPIs is reported quarterly. Our Group Compliance Committee and the Compliance Committees in our business units monitor the level of compliance with both health and safety laws and our internal policies on a regular basis. Ethical risks in the supply chain Millions of people around the world work directly for suppliers to Tesco and the supply chain is made of complex relationships - from individual farmers and growers through to processors, manufacturers and distributors. At the heart of our Values is our belief that we should treat people as we like to be treated and we have a responsibility to help workers in our supply chain enjoy fair labour standards. We therefore require our suppliers to meet strict criteria on labour standards, and as a founder member of the Ethical Trading Initiative ETI, we expect all our suppliers to follow the ETI Base Code and guarantee their workers the rights set out within it. There is, however, a risk that any part of the supply chain might not adhere to these high standards. T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 43 Our business To minimise this risk we only work with suppliers who can demonstrate that they are committed to the ETI Base Code and share our Values. We use Supplier Ethical Data Exchange SEDEX to carry out risk assessment of all our direct suppliers and all medium and high-risk suppliers must undergo an extensive, independent ethical audit. We continue to operate a comprehensive programme of audit improvements, including more unannounced audits and an industry-leading Auditor Recognition programme. We have also sought to involve more multi-stakeholder representatives on our audits to improve workforce engagement and enable activists to see and give feedback on our approach. We work with suppliers to identify any problems and, where they exist, support suppliers in taking action to improve standards for their workers. We have invested heavily in building the labour standards capabilities of our suppliers and our own commercial teams in the last year, including rolling out extensive training to help them identify and avoid issues before they arise. We also work with businesses, governments, non-governmental organisations NGOs and others to tackle complex and systemic problems that we cannot solve on our own. As well as having a key role in the ETI we also work closely with the Global Social Compliance Programme and other groups in specific industries and regions. Fraud and compliance As the business grows in size and geographical spread, the risk of the occurrence of fraudulent behaviour by our employees increases. Whilst the vast majority of our staff are completely honest, there remains the potential for fraud and other dishonest activity at all levels of the business, from the shop floor to senior management. The Group takes extensive steps to reduce this risk. Relevant accounting and other procedures and controls at all levels are clearly set out and audited across the business to reduce the risk of fraud. The Group gives clear guidance on behaviour to employees through the Tesco Values and the Group Code of Business Conduct. Internal Audit undertakes detailed investigations into all areas of the business and highlights its findings to the Audit Committee. The Compliance Committee formulates and monitors the implementation of, and compliance with, appropriate policies on key areas of ethical behaviour, including fraud. Property We have stretching targets for delivering new space in all of our markets and may face challenges in finding suitable sites and obtaining planning or other consents to enable sites to be acquired and developed. The complexity of many of our property developments is increasing, especially the growing number of malls and mixed-use schemes. We also have to comply with design and construction standards which vary significantly from country to country. Our Property Acquisition Committee and other related committees in the UK, Europe, Asia and the US closely control all aspects of the property acquisition, planning and construction processes to ensure that applicable standards are met and financial risks are minimised. Our Group and country Compliance Committees also monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in all aspects of our property activities. Non-food risks As the proportion of our business represented by non-food products increases, there is a risk that a downturn in consumer confidence may affect the level of demand for products which consumers may regard as non-essential. We make every effort to ensure that our non-food products are competitively priced and offer a broad range of products ranging from value to the luxury end of the market in order to cater for the needs of as wide a range of customers as possible. IT systems and infrastructure The business is dependent on efficient information technology IT systems. Any significant failure in the IT processes of our retail operations e. g. barcode scanning or supply chain logistics would impact our ability to trade. We recognise the essential role that IT plays across our operations in allowing us to trade efficiently and achieve commercial advantage through implementing IT innovations that improve the shopping trip for customers and make life easier for employees. We have extensive controls in place to maintain the integrity and efficiency of our IT infrastructure and we share systems from across our international operations to ensure consistency of delivery. Regulatory, political and economic environment We are subject to a wide variety of regulations in the different countries in which we operate because of the diverse nature of our business. Tesco may be impacted by regulatory changes in key areas such as planning laws, trading hours and tax rules as well as by scrutiny by the competition authorities who have been carrying out enquiries in the UK, Ireland and elsewhere. We may also be impacted by political developments and the economic environment in the countries in which we operate. We consider these uncertainties in the external environment when developing strategy and reviewing performance. We remain vigilant to future changes. As part of our day-to-day operations we engage with governmental and non-governmental organisations to ensure the views of our customers and employees are represented and try to anticipate and contribute to important changes in public policy wherever we operate. Activism and terrorism A major incident or terrorist event incapacitating management, systems or stores could impact on the Group's ability to trade. In addition to contingency plans, we have security systems and processes that reflect best practice. Pension risks The Group's pension arrangements are an important part of our employees' overall benefits package. We see them as a strong contributor to our ability to attract and retain good people. Since the implementation of IAS 19 there is a risk that the accounting valuation deficit which is recorded as a liability on the Group Balance Sheet could increase if returns on corporate bonds are higher than the investment return on the pension scheme's assets. The Group has considered its pension risks and has taken action by reducing risk in its investment strategy. Financial review The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions, fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and credit rating risks. These risks are managed as described below. The Group Balance Sheet position at 27 February 2010 is representative of the position throughout the year. Funding and liquidity The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, long and medium-term debt, capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases. The objective is to ensure continuity of funding. The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities and a strong credit rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. Tesco Group has a long-term rating of A3 with a negative outlook by Moody's and Aby Standard & Poor's. New funding of PS2.3bn was arranged during the year, including a net PS1.8bn from property transactions and PS0.5bn from long-term debt. At the year end, net debt was PS7.9bn last year PS9.6bn. 44 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Risks and uncertainties continued Interest rate risk management Our objective is to limit our exposure to increases in interest rates while retaining the opportunity to benefit from interest rate reductions. Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and collars are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Our policy is to fix or cap a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs of the Group excluding Tesco Bank. At the year end, PS5.6bn of debt was in fixed rate form 2009 - PS6.3bn with a further PS0.1bn of debt capped or collared, therefore 72% 2009 - 72% of net debt is fixed, capped or collared. The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate form. The average rate of interest paid on an historic cost basis this year, excluding joint ventures and associates, was 5.4% 2009 - 5.2%. Foreign currency risk management Our principal objective is to reduce the effect of exchange rate volatility on short-term profits. Transactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are hedged, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies and currency options. At the year end, forward foreign currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to PS1.083bn were outstanding 2009 - PS2.11bn as detailed in note 22. We hedge the majority of our investments in our international subsidiaries via foreign exchange transactions in matching currencies. Our objective is to maintain a low cost of borrowing and hedge against material movements in our Group Balance Sheet value. During the year, currency movements increased the net value of the Group's overseas assets by PS477m last year increase of PS480m. We translate overseas profits at average foreign exchange rates which we do not currently seek to hedge. Credit risk The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions across an approved list of counterparties of good credit quality. The Group's positions with these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored. Credit risk arising from Tesco Bank's unsecured lending is managed using all the normal credit assessment and collections and recoveries systems. In terms of liquidity risk Tesco Bank has implemented a conservative approach to the minimum amount of liquid assets its holds and to its Net Stable Funding Ratio. Insurance We purchased Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability protection from the open insurance market at 'catastrophe' level only. The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the business by using our captive insurance companies, Tesco Insurance Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the Republic of Ireland. Tesco Insurance Limited covers Assets and Earnings, while Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability.

All growth figures reported on a 53-week basis. 3 Tesco PLC annual Report and Financial statements 2009 cHaiRman's statement I am pleased to report that despite the extraordinary economic environment we find ourselves in, Tesco has once again delivered a good set of results. This demonstrates that Tesco is coping well with the downturn. Despite the challenging conditions around the globe we have remained resilient and are growing as fast as any major international retailer. We'five made several new appointments to the tesco Board in the year, including laurie mcilwee who takes on the role of group Finance Director, replacing andrew Higginson who has been appointed chief executive of Retailing services whilst retaining his responsibility for group strategy. laurie has been with tesco for nine years and has a very strong trackrecord in both finance and operations. in his most recent role as Distribution Director laurie was responsible for transforming our network - a tremendous achievement. His appointment shows once again how careful management succession planning works in tesco and i have every confidence he will do an outstanding job as our group Finance Director. We'five also appointed three strong new non-executive Directors in recent months - Jacqueline tammenoms Bakker, a former Director general at the ministry of transport in the netherlands who has also held senior positions at mcKinsey & co. and shell, patrick cescau, former ceo of Unilever and Ken Hanna, chairman of inchcape plc and former cFo of cadbury. they bring with them a wealth of international, commercial and financial experience which will further strengthen our Board and support our plans for the long-term growth of the group. Whilst the downturn has presented many challenges, it has also opened up some opportunities. We have made two very significant acquisitions this year. We have acquired the remaining 50% of tesco personal Finance from Royal Bank of scotland, a move which will enable us to develop an already very successful financial services offer towards our objective of becoming a full-service retail bank. in south Korea we purchased 36 hypermarkets from e-land, mostly in seoul, which has put us in a very strong position to challenge for market leadership in one of our most successful markets. most of our growth has again been organic - we'five opened nine million square feet of new space this year, excluding the acquisition in south Korea. in august we announced our entry into india, with plans to establish a cash & carry operation and a franchise agreement with trent to support their star Bazaar hypermarkets. this complements our entries into china and the United states, giving us access to another of the world's most important economies. Whilst many of our customers are focused on managing their shopping budgets, it is still important to them that we behave responsibly in the communities we serve. We now have a community plan for each country and earlier in the year we launched our community promises. these are: actively supporting local communities: buying and selling our products responsibly: caring for the environment: giving customers healthy choices: and creating good jobs and careers. We'five made some great progress this year - we'five opened our greenest ever store at cheetham Hill in manchester, with a carbon footprint that is 70% smaller than a typical store - bringing our total number of green stores across the group to 37. this will be a blueprint for how we build stores in the future. our work to encourage customers to make greener decisions is going well. through green clubcard points we have reduced the number of single-use carrier bags in the UK by 50% and we are finding innovative ways to use green clubcard elsewhere - for example by rewarding customers for cycling to our stores in south Korea. i'm also pleased to announce that in the UK we have once again broken our 'charity of the Year' record, raising a remarkable PS6.2 million for marie curie cancer care. although it was impossible to predict the scale of the global economic slowdown, tesco has responded well by adjusting our business to this environment. our 470,000 strong team have done a fantastic job - staying close to customers and reacting quickly to their changing needs around the world. i am confident that this hard work will continue as we press on with our long-term strategy which i believe will put us in an even stronger position once economies start to recover. 36% 33% 30% UK EUROPE ASIA US 1% 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 37.0 43.1 46.6 51.8 59.4 India South Korea China UK Poland Slovakia Japan Malaysia Czech Republic Hungary US T urkey Thailand Republic of Ireland 4 tesco at a glance Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2009 PS59.4bn Group sales No. 3 Third largest grocery retailer in the world 470,000 People 4,331 Stores worldwide 14 Countries Geographic locations Market Staff numbers Store numbers China 19,452 70 Czech Republic 12,677 113 Hungary 21,356 149 Japan 4,007 135 Malaysia 9,872 29 Poland 23,569 319 Rep.

We are also pleased with the early performance of Tesco Personal Finance under our ownership and with the converted Homever stores in South Korea. As a result, we have delivered a solid sales and profit performance, both in the UK and internationally, whilst continuing to invest in our longterm strategy for growth. We have made a good start to the new financial year and I am confident Tesco will continue to make good progress even in the current global economic environment. Q: It has been a very tough time for the economy but the good news is it has been very sturdy growth for Tesco. How have you managed that? A: it has been a very good year and mainly of course that is the dividend of having a long-term, consistent strategy. We'five invested into this slowdown and that has given us good momentum through the recession. We are growing fast in our overseas countries, laying out networks of stores and we are still opening new space in the UK as well. in addition to that, of course, people have to eat - we're blessed in that sense, so we don't face the worst of the slowdown. We'five also adjusted our business both in the UK and around the world to make sure that we offer better value and better ranges which keeps customers in the stores, and helps volume in the business. Q: You're very much in the front line when it comes to knowing what customers are thinking, how they are behaving. Are there any signs that we have perhaps reached the bottom of the recession? What lies in store for the economy do you think? A: it is very fluid at the moment - changes are happening over weeks, so i don't think you can see any clear direction yet. What i would say is that it looks as if things are stabilising on the consumer front. in the UK the lower interest rates help, as do the lower fuel prices and energy prices, and coupled with the work that we have done in reducing food prices for customers - this helps rebuild confidence. in central europe the economies had a big decline early in the summer and the autumn of 2008 - that feels as if it has levelled out, which is encouraging. in asia it is too early to say. their decline came later with the destocking of the supply chain and so for them it really hit around December. these are strong economies and the destocking will end and we'll start to get restocking in the pipeline which will help. Q: Priorities change during a recession - for business and customers alike. Is there a risk that the focus on green and corporate responsibility slips somewhat? A: it is important that it doesn't and it's one of the reasons we lay such emphasis within tesco on our 'steering Wheel' - our balanced scorecard - so that whatever is going on in the outside world, we keep focused on the things that matter long term. of course price and trading is important at the moment, but there are big long-term objectives around community and the environment that we have got to stay committed to. tesco has to help customers change from mass consumption to green consumption. on climate change, we'five got to learn how to run this business on 80% less carbon. We have got great plans and we are making great progress. of course it helps the business too - not wasting things is a very good habit at a time like this and one of the reasons our energy bills are down PS100 million this year is because of all of the green initiatives we'five been working on over several years. Q: Bearing in mind what you have seen in the US so far, are you pleased with the progress? A: i am, yes, because there's lots to be pleased about. clearly nobody would have chosen to open into the scale of recession that we'five seen there, which is particularly stiff in the Western United states, but the customers love the stores and they appeal right across the income range and the age range, and that bodes very well for their long-term appeal. Fresh & easy is more than just a niche retailer - it's a new and different form of retailing. customers obviously like the fresh foods and they like the own-brand products, but also are increasingly recognising the tremendous prices that are on offer and of course that is very important at the moment. the operation is very good and it's strong. We really have created the business that we set out to create in terms of the highest, freshest quality in the market at the best prices in the local neighbourhood. We are expanding the business at a good rate and morale is high. Q: What excites you most about the year ahead? A: First of all we're growing - and we're serving more customers. they have needs: they are just different needs at a time like this. it's what tesco is for - to stay close to customers and change as their needs change. that's got to take a different form in different categories or in different parts of the world. it's important you have strong, confident local leadership teams who take the responsibility to make those changes. if you look at our businesses - whether it's non-food, financial services or in our international markets - we are growing strongly and we are growing market share. there's more that we have to do from place to place, but confidence is high. people know what they have to do and have the authority to do it. At a time when customers everywhere are feeling the economic strain, we are responding to their changing needs in all our markets by lowering prices, introducing more affordable products and offering even sharper promotions.

Long-term strategy tesco has a well-established and consistent strategy for growth, which has allowed us to strengthen our core UK business and drive expansion into new markets. the rationale for the strategy is to broaden the scope of the business to enable it to deliver strong, sustainable long-term growth by following the customer into large expanding markets at home - such as financial services, non-food and telecoms - and new markets abroad, initially in central europe and asia, and more recently in the United states. the strategy to diversify the business was laid down in 1997 and has been the foundation of tesco's success in recent years. the new businesses which have been created and developed over the last 12 years as part of this strategy now have scale, they are competitive and profitable - in fact we are now market leader in many of our markets outside the UK. the group has continued to make good progress with this strategy, which has five elements, reflecting our four established areas of focus, and also tesco's long-term commitments on community and environment. importantly, the momentum which it has given the business has allowed the group to continue to grow well through the economic downturn. the objectives of the strategy are: to be a successful international retailer: to grow the core UK business: to be as strong in non-food as in food: to develop retailing services - such as Tesco Personal Finance, telecoms and tesco. com: and to put community at the heart of what we do. in 2008 9, tesco has again delivered a good performance, with all parts of the strategy contributing. We have sustained solid growth in the UK and coped well with the challenges of recession and improving competitors. in our international operations we have made good progress, completing a large programme of new store openings and carefully adjusting our businesses locally to the effects of the global economic slowdown. We have also acquired 36 hypermarkets in south Korea, our largest market outside the UK, in a move which has significantly strengthened our market position there, and begun the groundwork for a wholesale cash & carry business in india. in non-food, we continue to grow sales and market share and maintain profitability, against a background of a declining general retail market, and we have seen excellent growth from tesco Direct, which extends our reach in selling a broad range of products on the internet and via This Business Review analyses the performance of the Tesco Group in the financial year ended 28 February 2009. It also explains other aspects of the Group's markets, results and operations, including strategy and risk management. Business review We operate a balanced scorecard approach to managing the business that is known within the Group as our Steering Wheel. This unites the Group's resources and in particular focuses the efforts of our staff around our customers, people, operations, finance and the community. Its purpose is to ensure Tesco puts appropriate balance into the trade-offs that need to be made all the time between the main levers of management - such as delivery of customer metrics, operations measures and financial measures. It enables the business to be operated and monitored on a balanced basis with due regard to the needs of all stakeholders. For the owners of the business, it is simply based around the philosophy that if we look after customers well and operate efficiently and effectively, shareholders' interests will always be best served by the inevitable outputs of those - growth in sales, profits and returns. Our long-term strategy International Tesco is an international retailer and wherever we operate we focus on giving local customers what they want. Page 8 Core UK The UK is our biggest market and the core of our business. We aim to provide all our customers with excellent value and choice. Page 12 Non-food Our aim is to be as strong in non-food as in food. This means offering the same great quality, range, price and service for our customers as we do in our food business. Page 16 Retailing Services Tesco has followed its customers into the growing world of retailing services, aiming to bring simplicity and value to sometimes complex markets. Page 20 Community Tesco is a responsible business. We aim to take a leadership role in tackling climate change and believe in playing a positive role in all the communities we serve. 6bn UK EUROPE ASIA US PS0.2bn 7 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs Tesco PLC annual Report and Financial statements 2009 a catalogue. our retailing services have delivered another good year, with tesco. com growing strongly, tesco personal Finance making good progress and telecoms continuing to build its customer base strongly and grow profits. Finally, our work on community and environment continues - we have recently opened our latest blueprint green store at cheetham Hill, manchester, which has a carbon footprint 70% lower than a normal store. Markets served and business model tesco's growth, driven by this strategy, has been predominantly organic and we have used our skills and knowledge in understanding customers, property development, supply chain management, new product development, store formatting and adapting to local customer needs - to create strong business models in our chosen markets. Where we do not have all the required skills ourselves to be successful, we regularly partner with existing businesses - and these relationships have formed the basis of some of our most successful operations - for example with samsung in south Korea. the UK grocery retail market remains our largest source of revenue, representing some 50% of last year's PS59.4 billion of sales. international retail sales - from our 12 markets in europe, asia and the United states, comprise a further 30% of group revenues and non-food in a variety of categories from health and beauty to electronics accounts for most of the remainder. our services businesses have comparatively small revenue streams, but they are increasingly material to our earnings base. We have given them a renewed focus this year - deploying more capital and management resources. a first key step in making these already successful businesses much larger and more significant to the group was the acquisition of Royal Bank of scotland's share of tesco personal Finance - and we expect these businesses, including our online shopping channels, telecoms and dunnhumby our consumer research business to deliver PS1 billion a year of profit for the group within the next few years. at the core of tesco's business model is a focus on trying to improve what we do for customers. We aim to make their shopping experience as easy as possible, lower prices where we can to help them spend less, give them more choice about how they shop - in small stores, large stores or online - and seek to bring simplicity and value to sometimes complicated markets. We aim to be a good neighbour in the communities we serve, be responsible, fair and honest in our dealings and give customers the information and products they need to make greener choices. We are also an inclusive business - everyone is welcome at tesco. Underpinning this approach is a relentless attitude to being the lowest cost provider of goods and services in our chosen sectors - and this combination of qualities is the reason we have been successful in some of the world's most competitive markets. We have recognised skills and proprietary systems in key areas which help us deliver a low cost model - particularly in customer relationship management, just-in-time supply chain and distribution, property development and store formatting. in some of our newer markets - such as telecoms or financial services, our willingness to partner with established businesses has given us access to their existing investment in systems and infrastructure and enabled tesco to develop competitive, profitable business models quickly and, at the same time, limit our own investment and risk in the early years. in the case of financial services, having successfully partnered with Royal Bank of scotland for a decade we now have the experience to take sole ownership in order to pursue our aim of becoming a full-service retail bank and give tesco personal Finance the focus that this will require. My main challenge is to maintain the balance between staying on strategy while living within our means. For a growth company like Tesco it is vital of course that we meet the challenges posed by the economic downturn - and the priorities there are the same as for any finance director in the current environment - in helping the business to find the resources to invest for customers, by keeping a good grip on costs and cash. At the same time though, I need to do what I can to help sustain Tesco's investment in future growth. By investing in the right opportunities, protecting ourselves from unpredictable capital markets and trading in a sustainable way we should exit this recession as an even stronger company. That's how Tesco emerged as a winner from the last recession. Exciting opportunities are there to be grasped - for example, land and property are already significantly cheaper, our online businesses are not capital intensive and, given the loss of confidence in the banking sector, our very conservative, straightforward approach in Tesco Personal Finance may be exactly what customers are looking for. Laurie Mcllwee Group Finance Director Sales by region Sales growth contribution by region As Group Finance Director, what are your priorities at the moment? 8 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs We'five long understood that retailing is local. Each team on the ground is able to adjust our offer to each market because customers in China, for example, aren't the same as those in Poland or South Korea. So we'five never tried to run the international business from our office in the UK. In fact, we have very few expats working outside the UK - in South Korea just six out of a team of over 20,000 people. As we face into some strong economic headwinds, it's more important than ever to stay close to customers and be able to adapt quickly locally as their needs change. We have people in each of our markets who have a wealth of experience and are able to make the decisions that really matter. A big part of my job is about making sure we'five got the right people in each country, sharing experience around the business and empowering people to do the right things for their customers. Philip Clarke International and IT Director How do you run successful businesses in so many countries? International sales up 31% 9 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs Tesco PLC annual Report and Financial statements 2009 across our markets customers are changing their shopping habits as they are affected to varying degrees by the global economic downturn. in this kind of environment, it is more important than ever to listen to customers and adapt quickly to their changing needs. each of our markets is different so it's up to the individual businesses to adjust their offer locally. Using customer insight allows our experienced teams on the ground to make decisions based on real customer data. We have spent many years developing our customer insight skills, particularly through dunnhumby, the consumer research company behind our loyalty scheme, clubcard. through careful analysis of sales and loyalty card data we can better understand what is important to our customers. this year we have been using this unique insight across most parts of our business so we don't have to guess what our customers want, we know. in all our markets it's helping us select the most important items for price-sensitive or cost-conscious shoppers so we can invest in lowering prices on the most important items to help customers through tough economic times. For example, in malaysia, we have reviewed our range of staple foods and groceries and as a result we have introduced 27 new products to the basket, which we know are among the most important for customers. We now make sure that we are not beaten on price for these products. this insight is also helping us to make things simpler for customers to shop in our stores. For example, in asia we have worked with our leading supplier of baby milk. By reviewing the sales data we discovered that displaying the products by brand rather than by age was important so we are changing the layout on the shelves to make it easier for customers to find the products they want. Whilst it is important to invest in the shopping trip we are also continuing to invest for future growth. this is a strategy that has served us well in the past: for example we entered thailand and south Korea during the asian economic crisis in the 1990s and emerged stronger once the economies started to recover. We are now market leader in thailand and following our acquisition of 36 hypermarkets in south Korea we are now in a very strong position to challenge for market leadership there as well. We also announced our entry into the indian market last year. We are establishing a cash & carry business that will offer a comprehensive range of great value fresh food, grocery and non-food products to small retailers, restaurants, kirana stores and other business owners. We will also provide farmers and other suppliers with a highly efficient route to market. in addition, we have signed an exclusive franchise agreement with trent, the retail arm of the tata group. trent currently operates four star Bazaar hypermarkets, with plans to grow to 50 stores over the next five years. We will supply these hypermarkets with products, but also offer our retail expertise and technical capability to support the development of their business. the overall performance of our international businesses during the year has been strong, particularly against the background of increasingly challenging trading conditions in all of our markets as the effects of the economic downturn on consumers have grown and spread around the world. We have delivered very good sales and profit growth and our investment returns have held up well. importantly, we have grown share in all of our markets and in some countries we have made more rapid progress this year by sticking to our strategy as competitors falter. By continuing to focus on doing the right things for customers - lowering prices, introducing more affordable products, offering even stronger promotions - they have rewarded us with good sales and market share growth. By keeping our costs low and pushing on with expansion, we aim to take the opportunity to strengthen further our market positions during the recession. International It's been another good year for our international business which now spans 13 countries across Asia, Europe and the United States. As customers around the world are feeling the effects of the global economic slowdown we are successfully adjusting our offer in all our markets to help customers who are feeling the pinch. Loyalty card schemes We have national loyalty card schemes based on Clubcard in Ireland, Malaysia, South Korea and China and pilot schemes in Slovakia, Poland, Thailand and Turkey. 10 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs Tesco PLC annual Report and Financial statements 2009 in most of our markets we are now amongst the largest, most profitable and fastest growing businesses - and this is a good platform from which to make further progress, even in tough times. our experience in Hungary of trading profitably and growing well during an already prolonged recession which began in 2006, also gives us confidence that by applying what we have learned there in our other markets, the business can perform well through the current environment. europe - including ireland, turkey and the four central european countries - and the Western Us have seen the most marked effects of the economic downturn although more recently, as the export-led economies of asia - particularly south Korea and china - have also slowed, trading conditions there too have deteriorated. in europe, these challenges have been joined by the consequences of substantial exchange rate movements between the euro or euro-linked currencies and other currencies within the european Union. these movements have encouraged very significant increases in cross-border shopping by consumers in several regions - the clearest examples being ireland into northern ireland, czech Republic into germany and slovakia into poland. our stores located close to these borders have seen material sales impacts as customers take advantage of devalued currencies and this has affected the rate of sales growth overall in these markets. although in some markets we have moderated our rate of growth in space, overall we have chosen to sustain strong growth in selling area - and this will continue. With reductions in site, build and fitting costs for stores - these have fallen substantially since last year - we are able to use our capital more efficiently, and this should be helpful to long-term returns. at the end of February, our operations in asia and europe were trading from 1,911 stores, including 608 hypermarkets, with a total of 55.0m sq ft of selling space. this year, we plan to open 320 new stores with a total of 5.4m square feet of sales area in these markets and a further 0.6m sq ft is planned to open in the Us. Asia We have delivered a strong performance in asia. this has been achieved whilst absorbing planned integration costs and initial trading losses during conversion on the newly-acquired Homever stores in south Korea. With all the stores now converted to our Homeplus format, we expect this acquisition to provide a good underpinning to growth in asia as a whole in the current year and beyond as we realise the synergies and scale benefits from the deal. the underlying business in south Korea delivered solid profit growth and elsewhere in asia we saw excellent progress in malaysia and thailand, partly offset by a small trading loss in Japan. In China, having studied the market carefully and developed our long-term strategy, we have begun to accelerate store and infrastructure development in the economically important and populous coastal provinces, centred on the major cities. our first multi-level freehold shopping centre development will open in Foshun in a few months' time, with a further three planned in the current year. sites have been secured for a further 14. We saw strong sales, including good like-for-like growth in the year as a whole - although sales slowed in the final quarter, partly driven by food price deflation - and we made a modest profit, similar to last year. Japan's already difficult retail market saw a further sharp deterioration towards the end of 2008. the new team in Japan is building on last year's introduction of the tesco operating model - a suite of systems and processes which is being rolled out across our markets - by strengthening distribution, range and pricing management. our strategic focus remains on building a strong offer for customers in the convenience sector based on express and on our tsurukame small discount supermarket format and this work is making progress. 13 new stores including six of our new 24-hour express stores opened during the year. Homeplus in South Korea - which celebrates its tenth anniversary this year - delivered another very good performance, coping well with the twin challenges of subdued consumer spending and the task of integrating the 36 Homever stores which were acquired in september. including the acquired stores, 3.9m square feet of space - an increase of 63% - was opened during the year. some of last year's organic development was deferred whilst we focused on integrating Homever and our programme of new space this year will reflect this. the customer response to the conversion of the stores to Homeplus has been excellent, with sales uplifts on the converted stores averaging well over 50%. the performance of our express stores, which saw sales growth of 64% in the year, has also been very encouraging. Malaysia has had an exceptional year - achieving rapid progress in sales, profits and returns as it delivers the full benefits of the makro acquisition in early 2007. this success, combined with a fast rate of organic expansion, has enabled us to become market leader in a country which we entered only in 2001. although economic growth has slowed in recent months, our strong market position plus a good pipeline of seven planned new hypermarkets in the current year, mean we can extend our lead. clubcard, which was launched at the end of 2007, is being very well-received by customers. Tesco Lotus in Thailand has delivered strong growth against the background of sustained political uncertainty and a weakening economy. consumer confidence levels are low but our continued investment in improving our offer for customers has served the business well and we are continuing to outperform our major competitors. our small format stores - particularly talad supermarkets and express stores, which are very popular with customers in the larger cities - have seen very good growth in both sales and profit. International continued Poland In Poland we have launched the first phase of our new discount range designed to compete with local limited range discounters. 11 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs Tesco PLC annual Report and Financial statements 2009 Europe our european growth for the year as a whole has been strong, helped overall by favourable exchange rate movements. During the second half, the effects of the global economic slowdown have been felt in all of our markets - reflected in slowing gDp growth and deteriorating consumer confidence and spending levels. inevitably, our businesses have been impacted, resulting in slower growth in sales and profit at constant exchange rates from last autumn onwards. Whilst our food and grocery categories have remained robust - and we have seen excellent market share performances across our markets - non-food sales, principally of hardlines, have been subdued and this has held back hypermarket growth in particular. our multiformat approach has helped to mitigate this and we have seen very good growth in our smaller-format stores, particularly in central europe, and these remain a priority in our expansion plans. the work we have done on pan-european sourcing of tesco own-brand and general merchandise has further strengthened our competitive position in the region. We have fully launched the equivalent of our UK 'Discount Brands' in several markets and customer feedback has been very encouraging. the performance of cherokee and F F clothing in europe has also been pleasing and we have taken significant market share. overall clothing sales are up 11%, including 6% like-for-like growth - with children's garment sales increasing by 43%. In the Czech Republic, levels of consumer demand have been affected both by the slowdown in the economy and by the increasing scale of cross-border shopping into neighbouring germany, driven by the strength of the Koruna. Despite this, good cost control offsetting investment in lower prices, better pay rates and improved service levels and continued expansion delivered solid growth in profits in the year. our early express stores have been well-received by customers in central prague and we are continuing a programme of refits - and in some cases major redevelopments - of our department stores. this included the complete remodelling of our large department store in leberec, which was completed last month. Hungary has endured a serious economic recession for approaching three years. However, our strategy of cutting costs and investing in lowering prices and expanding our store network is continuing to yield good results and we have been able to sustain profit growth this year in very challenging circumstances. like-for-like sales growth ex-petrol was positive and we are outperforming most of our competitors, with our market share growing to 17%. our new store opening programme delivered a 13% increase in our space through 14 large hypermarkets and 12 smaller format stores. In Poland, our business has delivered a very strong performance, including robust growth in sales and profits. this was achieved in the context of competitive trading conditions and significant wage investment and energy cost inflation during the year. Having successfully completed the integration of the former leader price stores - where the cumulative sales uplift on conversion is now approaching 60% - we have resumed faster organic expansion, with six large new hypermarkets and 12 compact hypermarkets opened in the year. overall like-for-like growth was solid, with small formats seeing stronger growth than hypermarkets. We have recently introduced a new range of 700 'Discount Brand' products and these are proving very popular with customers. A solid performance from Tesco Ireland produced another year of growth despite the extremely difficult economic climate and trading conditions have worsened in recent months. a combination of very tight cost control and more international buying have helped us invest in lowering prices for customers. these investments have become even more necessary given the steep rise in cross-border shopping into northern ireland encouraged by the decline in sterling relative to the euro - which has seen an estimated 4% of the total market move over the border. the benefits of our new distribution centre at Donabate have delivered substantial efficiencies and improved stock management, and we have also seen a strong performance from our new stores. In Slovakia we saw excellent growth, although the adoption of the euro in January 2009 gave rise to conversion costs and, given the weakening currencies relative to the euro in bordering countries, we saw the emergence of cross-border shopping towards the end of the year. this has impacted sales in recent months. From our strong market-leading position, and with an excellent and growing network of multi-format stores, we have coped well with the tougher market conditions and achieved good market share gains. In Turkey, Kipa, which is one of our smallest but fastest-growing businesses, has seen strong sales, driven by the growth of new space, but pressure on margins resulting from the sharp contraction in the economy and consumer demand during recent months. We are continuing to see growth in share in a very fragmented market but given the severity of the downturn in turkey, we have decided to slow our rate of expansion for the time being. turkey remains an important strategic longer-term opportunity for us as a large, growing and relatively underdeveloped retail market. United States Fresh & easy has made good progress. We are now trading from 115 stores and the early openings have moved strongly into like-for-like growth. Whilst it is still early days, and the economic environment into which we originally launched the business has markedly changed, customers' very positive feedback on our offer has continued to surpass our expectations. Research confirms that they love the quality and freshness of our ranges, as well as the prices and the convenient locations of the stores. the normal process of adapting a new format to fully meet the needs of customers locally has resulted in some changes to the product ranges, the introduction of a limited number of promotions and special offers, as well as improvements to the ambience of the stores. these changes have been well-received and consequently we are seeing very strong growth in customer numbers per store. given the scale of the economic downturn, particularly in las vegas, phoenix and the inland empire region of california, we are also seeing increased demand from customers looking to make stretched household budgets go further - through more affordable products, larger pack sizes and additional range in some categories, such as grocery and frozen food. We are looking to meet these needs by making further changes to the stores. as previously announced, we are taking a more cautious approach to expansion by maintaining instead of accelerating the rate of new store opening, until economic conditions start to improve in the Western states in which we operate. We opened 62 new stores in the year with 0.6m square feet of selling space and we expect to open a similar number during the current year, mostly in the second half. last april, with our preliminary Results, we said that initial Us trading losses would total around PS100m in the 2008 9 financial year. Us trading losses in 2008 9 were higher than expected, at PS142m, principally as a result of the adverse movement in the Dollar: sterling exchange rate during the second half and higher overhead costs linked to our more prudent rate of new store opening. We expect a similar loss in the current year. 12 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs Making many small improvements in everything we do is what 'Every Little Helps' is about, because when we all work together on the little things, it amounts to a great deal. It's more important today than it's ever been - it keeps us focused on what matters most to customers. They are shopping around more and price is clearly a priority for many - so we need to put the right effort and investment into price - but not sacrifice all the other things that are so important to customers, such as not having to queue and being able to get everything that they want. So we'five continued to make lots of small improvements and they're making a big difference. For example, through a number of initiatives to achieve a better and more efficient service at our checkouts, many more customers didn't have to queue last year and customers continue to rank us best for speed of service at the checkouts. David Potts Retail and Logistics Director Is 'Every Little Helps' still important? PS540m in productivity savings 13 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs Tesco PLC annual Report and Financial statements 2009 it's been a tough year for many of our customers. consumer confidence has fallen as people worry about unemployment and are struggling to manage their household budgets. not surprisingly, there has been a shift in our customers' priorities - our research has shown that price is ranked as the most important by a margin not seen in two decades. therefore, we believe our job is to be on the side of customers, listening to them and doing what we can to help them spend less. at the time of the last recession we launched value lines - the famous blue and white stripes - so we'five long been able to provide the cheapest grocery shop in the country, discounters included. this recession has provided a new challenge because although customers tend to shop around more for the best prices when times are hard - it doesn't mean they want to compromise on quality of the shopping trip or on choice. that is why this year we made the biggest change to our range in a decade, launching around 500 new products as part of our 'Discount Brands at tesco' initiative. the new range means that every customer can have a product to match their budget without compromising on choice or quality. it creates a completely new way to shop for customers who want to spend less. as well as introducing more affordable products we have been working hard to cut prices across the store. to help us do this we have been keeping very good control of costs and have put more focus on our efficiency saving programme we call step-change. this programme has delivered PS540 million of productivity and other savings in the year, most of which have been reinvested in improving our shopping trip for customers. this programme involves many projects right across the business which change the way we do things to drive efficiency. many of today's savings were conceived and planned years ago and they are a result of productivity projects that span the whole business, from stores and depots to the office. they range from reducing the amount of energy we use in our stores to introducing better ways of working to improve our efficiency by making things better for customers, simpler for staff and cheaper for tesco. For example, in the last year we have saved 52,000 deliveries to our stores by using larger-fill double-decked vehicles, which in turn have also saved 12 million road miles. We'five also introduced innovative technology which allows us to electronically check-in bread and milk deliveries at our depots, eliminating substantial paperwork and administration. We have picked up the pace on a number of these long-term cross-functional step-change projects and plan to deliver similar savings in the current year of around PS550 million. these savings will continue to go back into improving our offer for customers. making things better, simpler and cheaper is part of our culture at tesco and all our people are encouraged to suggest new ideas on how we can achieve this. Core UK Everyone in the business understands the way we work - to make things better for customers, simpler for staff and cheaper for Tesco. At a time when customers are feeling the pinch and our competitors have improved, this philosophy is more important than ever. 30% Around 30% of our customers buy something from our 'Discount Brands at Tesco' every time they shop. 12m road miles saved with double-decked trucks One-in-front promise Millions more customers didn't have to queue at the checkout last year thanks to our one-in-front promise. 14 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs some examples of these projects which have delivered substantial savings in the year include: Savings in the supply chain - from more shelf-ready packaging and reconfiguring of our depot network to increased vehicle utilisation and more productive work methods in depots and stores - mean that, for example, distribution costs have been held in cash terms and reduced in percentage of sales terms. this has been achieved despite higher fuel costs. We have significantly increased the level of capital investment in energy-saving projects across the business - in new refrigeration, store lobbies and lighting - delivering significant reductions in consumption and helping us to absorb rising utility costs. energy consumption in tesco fell by 8% last year despite business growth. We now have 3,100 employees at our Hindustan Global Support centre in Bangalore, india, which provides it and administrative support to our UK and international operations - from software development to management accounting and payroll. The introduction of new checkout technology for stores, which is faster, more accurate and easier for staff, has continued to reduce costs and improve customer service. For example, around 25% of our UK customer transactions are through self-service checkouts. UK performance in the UK, tesco coped well with recovering competitors and a difficult non-food market, particularly in the second half, to deliver solid progress in the year. UK retail sales grew by 9.1%, including a like-forlike increase, including petrol, of 4.3% 3.0% excluding petrol.

Whilst price and value matter more to many customers at times like these, as always, we are improving all aspects of the shopping trip, including service and availability. as part of this, we are planning to relaunch and invest substantially more in clubcard - our unique way of saying 'thank you' to our customers - in the coming weeks. New space We opened a total of 2.0m square feet of new sales area in 2008 9, of which 362,000 square feet was in store extensions, principally for extra. We opened another 11 extra hypermarkets - six from extensions to existing stores and five new stores, bringing the total to 177, with a further 15 planned this year. extra now represents 40% of our total sales area. We also opened 21 new superstores and 125 new express stores, bringing the overall total number of tesco stores to 2,282. in the current year, we aim to open a similar amount of new space across our formats - equivalent to an additional 6.4% of sales area. 25% of our customer transactions are through self-service checkouts To reflect our customers' need to spend less, we have invested millions of pounds in cutting prices and introduced more promotions, as well as launching new ranges of affordable products in both our Value range and our new 'Discount Brands'. Although there are many different conflicting claims on price in the marketplace, we have focused on comparing the prices of real customers' baskets from Clubcard on the products people buy most often. These baskets clearly show that Tesco is cheaper on the real baskets people actually buy, and is the most comprehensive survey in the marketplace today. In order to continue to reduce our prices, our efficiency programme Step-Change generated PS540m of savings in the last year which we have been reinvesting back in our offer and will be doing more of this in the year ahead. Some of your competitors say that they are cheaper than T esco. Why aren't you doing more to cut prices? 16 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs Across the non-food market, customers have been cutting back on non-essential purchases. But they have been buying when they see real value and, as a consequence, we have increased our market share as customers appreciate the convenience of buying non-food from Tesco and the value that we offer. We'five been adding new ranges with lower price-points and extending ranges that consumers see as essentials and we'five seen real success on own-brand products such as Technika in electricals and Cherokee and F F in our clothing offer. Our online catalogue non-food offer, Tesco Direct, has been very popular and we have seen strong growth with our latest spring summer range which included 1,500 price cuts compared to our autumn winter catalogue. With the benefit of high footfall, great value ranges and the option to shop in store or online, we are well-placed to continue to grow both sales and market share in a difficult market. Richard Brasher Commercial and Marketing Director Lots of high street retailers have been cutting prices. Can I still get the best deals at Tesco? PS12.5bn Group non-food sales 17 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs Tesco PLC annual Report and Financial statements 2009 non-food remains an important part of our strategy and we continue to grow both sales and market share. in our experience, customers will buy where they see value. to help customers we have been making changes to our ranges and cutting prices. For example, in the UK sales of our technika own-brand televisions have been very strong as customers trade away from big brands and we now have a 10% share of the television market. We'five also been promoting our slow cooking appliances as customers have been buying cheaper cuts of meat and cooking from scratch - half of all slow cookers bought in the run-up to christmas were sold in tesco. our online non-food business, tesco Direct, continues to grow rapidly, increasing sales by more than 50% in the year. the latest spring summer catalogue and website includes over 1,500 products that are cheaper than they were last year. in the current year we also plan to introduce an online clothing offer - making our fashionable, affordable clothes easier to buy for many more customers. to ensure that we offer the best possible prices for customers we buy many products globally so that we benefit from our scale. We have an international sourcing office based in Hong Kong which is responsible for buying 100,000 non-food products for the group. the international sourcing operation has seen rapid growth in the last few years and now sources 60% of our clothing in the UK and 40% of hardlines, including electricals, homewares, entertainment, toys and books. in europe it provides over 25% of our hardlines and 85% of our clothing and we have recently started to source products for asia. in the last year our international sourcing team shipped 72,000 containers from 54 ports. We also have sourcing hubs in china, india, sri lanka, Bangladesh and turkey, with smaller offices in thailand, czech Republic and italy. We have invested in buying hubs where we have a critical mass of suppliers and shipment volumes. it helps to be close to our suppliers so that we can ensure great quality products, delivered from ethical sources, on time and at the best price. Where possible we try to source products direct from factories rather than through agents or middlemen. this way we can ensure the lowest possible cost price as well as making sure that our products are sourced safely and fairly. We also manage to strip out more costs by consolidating freight volumes. this gives us the best shipping and transportation rates, which can be passed on to the customer in the form of lower prices. Non-food It's been a challenging year for non-food as consumers around the globe have been hit by the economic downturn and are cutting back on non-essential purchases - but by keeping our prices low, improving our offer in key categories like electricals and clothing and giving customers more choice about how they shop, such as through Tesco Direct - we have outperformed the market. 5 Technika is the fifth largest TV brand in the UK.

UK non-food sales rose by 5% in the year, compared with 9% in 2007 8, with total non-food sales increasing to PS8.7 billion included in reported UK sales. second half like-for-like was encouraging, showing a small improvement versus Quarter 2, with a stable performance in Quarter 4 compared with Quarter 3. We saw growth in some hardlines categories - particularly in electrical goods, games and entertainment - and also in pharmacy. Home related categories reflecting the slowdown in the housing market, were more challenging - particularly furniture, DiY and cookware. on a like-for-like basis, clothing sales reduced by 2% in the year, but outperformed the market - with good growth in menswear and an improving trend in childrenswear, with a stronger second half performance. Non-food continued Non-food is an important part of a long-term strategy for growth. It is a market which is similar in size to food and in which we only have a small share so we see it as a big opportunity for us in the future, irrespective of the economic climate. Last year we opened over 600,000 square feet of new space for non-food in the UK alone - including our latest non-food-only Homeplus stores in Edinburgh and Nottingham - which means more customers than ever have access to our offer in store. With Tesco Direct we have made our widest non-food range available to millions of customers who can't get to one of our larger stores. In fact, we get around 1.5 million visits to the website each week and we'five continued to roll-out Direct collection desks in store so customers have the convenience of collecting their purchases at the same time as doing their weekly shop, as well as having the opportunity to have them delivered directly to their homes. Have you cut back on the amount of new space you are adding for non-food? 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 6.0 6.8 10.4 11.8 12.5 19 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs Tesco PLC annual Report and Financial statements 2009 tesco Direct, which is managed within tesco. com, is designed to extend the reach of our non-food offer by making it more available to customers via the internet and catalogues and is now established and thriving. it has delivered excellent sales growth and reduced losses as planned. We issued 11.5 million catalogues last year and now have 12,500 products available online. the popularity of our in-store Direct desks, which are now in 231 stores, continues to increase as more customers order and collect items from their local tesco.

We're building stronger relationships with our global non-food suppliers by reducing the number we work with. We'five improved the quality of supplier audits and now have 730 authorised independent auditors around the world. To ensure that audits are representative, we have made a significant shift from announced to surprise audits where suppliers are given a one month window when auditors may visit. In October we were highly commended for the Fashion Ethical Cotton Award - the only major retailer nominated in any category. com cr-report09 Non-food sales PSbn How do you ensure that your products are ethically sourced in places like Bangladesh?

Over time customers have come to trust Tesco to deliver value whether they are buying their weekly shop or opening a savings account. Their trust is very important to us. So we take the same approach to financial services as we do to all other parts of our business and that means offering competitive, straightforward products with no confusing small print and hidden charges. Unlike many of the high street banks TPF is well funded - we never got involved in any of the complicated financial products and toxic debt that has caused so many problems for the banking sector. So while many banks now have to grow their margins and rebuild their balance sheets, we can concentrate on offering competitive rates across our savings, loans, credit cards and insurance products. We are aiming to add more value by rewarding our loyal customers with Clubcard points, which is of course unique to Tesco. Looking further ahead, it's clear that customers want us to provide a real alternative to other banks and that means a broader product range, including a current account.

Developing Retailing services has been part of our strategy for over a decade - with the aim of bringing value and simplicity to customers through services such as telecoms and financial products. after ten years of success, we have given it a renewed focus and in July we announced that andrew Higginson would relinquish his role as group Finance Director to take on the role of chief executive of Retailing services. He has assembled an experienced team to really drive forward this part of the strategy, which we believe has the potential to deliver PS1 billion of annual profit in the next few years. the aim is to develop our services business to offer customers the same convenience we have brought to food shopping, to all the other products and services we offer. our dotcom grocery business and now our online non-food offer, tesco Direct, have already added more convenient options for customers to shop - particularly those with very busy lives or limited access to transport. the growing power of the internet means increasingly that people look to this channel to buy everyday services and goods. However, many people still like the reassurance of being able to talk to someone knowledgeable about the products and services they buy. We believe in offering customers the choice - to shop in the way which most suits their needs whether that is online, in store or by phone. that is why we now have 40 phone shops in our stores, and we plan to have around 100 open by the end of this year. this means more customers than ever can access our popular telecoms offer. We remain one of the fastest growing providers for pre-pay mobiles and we are now attracting more customers through our new contract mobile deals. in December we completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% of tpF from Royal Bank of scotland group plc RBsg. this was an important move for tesco, allowing us to build on the success of tpF and eventually offer customers the products you would expect from a full-service retail bank. this will mean growing our existing customer base across the 28 simple products we offer from home insurance to credit cards, but also attracting new customers at a time when many have lost trust in their high street bank. all our current financial products are available to buy online and at present over 50% of our customers choose to buy this way. However, in the same way as customers value the service offered by our telecoms centres, we understand that many would like to discuss their financial needs with someone knowledgeable. We plan to increase our presence for tpF by extending the trial of our in-store branches which offer customers the opportunity to talk to our specially trained finance advisors in a convenient location.

We are committing more capital, management and other resources to support this growth. We completed the acquisition of tpF on 19 December 2008, for cash consideration of around PS950m. the business is profitable and well-capitalised, which is a strong platform from which to pursue our plans to develop tpF from a successful, popular collection of financial products to a full-service retail bank in the years ahead. the new team, combining experienced management from tesco and from the banking industry, is coming together well. their focus for the time being is on migrating systems and customer support over to our own platforms, beginning the development of a branch network in tesco stores and growing the business, both through existing and new products. overall tpF has delivered a good performance, despite the challenging conditions in its markets and the protracted period between the announcement of the acquisition and its completion. the following commentary on the performance of the business relates to the tpF pro-forma income statement and actual balance sheet, which can be found in our preliminary Results statement appendix 1 at www. com investorcentre, covering the year to 28 February 2009. Underlying profit before tax, which excludes the amortisation of intangible assets linked to the acquisition, was PS244 million. this performance was achieved against the background of an increase in bad debts, particularly during the second half of the year, although tpF's bad debt experience remains significantly better than the banking industry average. profit before tax and minority interest was PS212 million, which was also a pleasing performance in the context of the broader economic conditions. Under iFRs, we are required to amortise intangible assets arising on acquisition. this non-cash charge for the period was PS32 million and we expect this to increase to approximately PS130 million in 2009 10 and reduce thereafter. total revenue was PS949 million - generated by a combination of interest income and fees. the key products generating interest income savings, loans and credit cards all held up well in the current climate. in fee income, there was good growth from both credit cards and the atm estate. Underlying costs included an increased investment in tesco. compare and the planned rise in overhead cost as the business prepares for a faster rate of growth. impairment losses on the cards and loans portfolios increased in the second half against the background of deteriorating market conditions.

However, the challenging economic conditions throughout the year have resulted in some increase in bad debt levels and fraud. the reduction in bank rates in recent months has, however, helped lending margins, a trend which has continued into 2009 10. tpF uses a range of techniques to ensure that risk and reward is balanced and remains committed to responsible lending. com delivered another excellent performance, with our online businesses achieving a 20% increase in sales to PS1.9bn, with profits after initial start-up losses on tesco Direct, rising to PS109m. We are continuing to see robust growth in customer and order numbers and operationally the business made further progress, with improved product availability, and strong productivity. growth in the international businesses - in south Korea and ireland - was very strong. Telecoms had a good year, with particularly robust growth in tesco mobile. mobile saw double-digit growth in customer numbers in a flat pre-pay phone market and an encouraging early performance from our new pay-monthly tariffs, which were launched during the year. tesco mobile retained its status as the best service in the market for overall customer satisfaction. 32 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs Tesco PLC annual Report and Financial statements 2009 these results are for the 53 weeks ended 28 February 2009 for the UK, ireland and the United states Us and for the 52-weeks ended 28 February 2009 for the rest of the group. this compares with the 52-week period ending 23 February 2008. Where appropriate, growth rates are provided on a comparable 52-week basis. growth in sales and profit growth is reported on a consistent basis 12 months versus 12 months for china. last year's numbers for group, international and for asia have been restated to reflect this change. group sales, including vat, increased by 15.1% to PS59.4bn last year PS51.6bn. at constant exchange rates sales increased by 10.6%. on a 52-week comparable basis, group sales growth was 13.5%. in 2006, following our transition to iFRs, we introduced an underlying profit measure, which excludes the impact of the volatile non-cash elements of ias 19, ias 32, ias 39 and ias 17 principally pension costs, the marking to market of financial instruments and the impact of annual uplifts in rents and rent-free periods and now also excludes the amortisation charge on intangible assets arising on acquisition this year relating to tesco personal Finance.

Us sales and initial trading losses were previously reported within the UK segment. Us sales were PS208m in the year, including like-for-like growth of 30%, and trading losses were PS142m last year Us trading losses were PS62m. at constant exchange rates, trading losses were PS123m, higher than our guidance provided last year, reflecting the more challenging trading environment in the Western states and our decision not to open stores in northern california for the time being. sales overall were lower than anticipated at the time of last year's preliminary Results, as a consequence of our previously announced decision to maintain, rather than accelerate, our rate of new store expansion during the second half given the severity of the economic downturn in some geographic markets in the Western Us. Us trading losses reflect the fact that the Us business - which has now been trading for 16 months - has been built with the necessary infrastructure in place from the beginning to support hundreds of stores. at this stage, it is therefore operating with high overhead and other costs in relation to the scale of the business, whilst also trading from immature stores.

UK sales increased by 9.5% to PS41.5bn last year PS37.9bn, including like-for-like growth of 4.3%, 2.7% growth from net new stores, a contribution of 2.1% from the 53rd week and a first-time contribution from the consolidation of tpF. excluding petrol, like-for-like sales grew by 3.0%, with increases of 2.0% and 2.7% in the third and fourth quarters respectively. adjusting for the reduction in vat rates, which came into effect in early December, like-for-like growth excluding petrol was 3.7% in the fourth quarter. the pattern of our trading during the year was affected by a number of factors. inflation reduced during the second half and our rate of growth was also impacted by a sharp increase during the year in the level of downtrading by customers seeking to spend less on their weekly shop. tesco supported both of these trends by cutting prices and introducing more affordable products - including our successful new 'Discount Brand' ranges. a combination of recovering competitors and more subdued customer demand in some non-food product categories continued to hold back sales progress in the second half, although non-food sales growth remained positive in a subdued market and broadly stable in like-for-like terms. increased productivity and good expense control enabled us to maintain solid margins and deliver good profit growth despite these challenges, whilst also absorbing initial trading losses totalling around PS22m on tesco Direct. after these costs, UK trading profit rose 12.7% to PS2,381m last year PS2,112m, with trading margins at 6.2% including tpF, slightly up on last year. on a 52-week comparable basis, UK trading profit rose 10.7%. in December, we completed as planned the acquisition of the Royal Bank of scotland group plc's 50% shareholding in tesco personal Finance tpF and on becoming a subsidiary, its results were consolidated into our UK business for the final ten weeks of the financial year. During this period it contributed PS163m to UK sales and made a small contribution to trading profit. tpF's results to the date of acquisition are reported as usual within Joint ventures and associates. UK sales inc. vat PS41,520m 9.5% 7.4% UK trading profit PS2,381m 12.7% 10.7% trading margin 6.2% - - Joint ventures and associates our share of profit net of tax and interest for the year was PS110m, an increase of PS35m compared with last year. tesco personal Finance delivered a good performance in a challenging financial services market and profit was reported within Joint ventures and associates for 50 weeks 50% share. Underlying growth in the business was encouraging - with the number of customer accounts rising to six million - and the new management team demonstrating that there is significant growth potential for tpF within the financial services sector, particularly amongst loyal tesco customers, and as we build our portfolio of products. although we are seeing rises in credit card arrears and bad debts, tpF is well-provisioned. tesco mobile, our joint venture with o2, saw strong growth, with a pleasing rise in profits during the year, reflecting excellent increases in customer numbers and revenues. Finance costs and tax net finance costs rose substantially to PS362m last year PS63m, reflecting principally increased average net debt levels linked to acquisitions and foreign exchange movements, higher coupon rates on commercial paper and unfavourable changes in the non-cash iFRs elements of the interest charge. the interest charge, excluding iFRs adjustments, rose by PS150m. total group tax has been charged at an effective rate of 26.7% last year 24.0%. this increase in tax rate is primarily due to last year's one-off tax reimbursement, reflecting settlement of prior year tax items with HmRc. We also benefited in the prior year from an adjustment of deferred tax balances as a result of the lowering of the rate of UK corporation tax from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 april 2008. We expect the effective tax rate for the current year to be around 27%. Underlying diluted earnings per share increased by 7.0% to 28.92p last year 27.02p, despite the significantly lower than normal effective tax rate in the prior year. Using a constant tax rate, underlying diluted earnings per share rose by 11.0%, or by 9.7% on a 52-week comparable basis. Dividend the Board has proposed a final dividend of 8.39p per share last year 7.70p. this represents an increase of 9.0%, and takes the full year increase in dividend to 9.7%. this rise in dividend is in line with the 52-week growth in underlying diluted earnings per share, which are inclusive of net property profits, using a constant tax rate. going forward, we intend to continue with our policy of growing annual dividends broadly in line with underlying diluted earnings per share growth. the final dividend will be paid on 10 July 2009 to shareholders on the Register of members at the close of business on 1 may 2009. Cash flow and balance sheet tesco has a strong, property-backed balance sheet, with sufficient funding in place to meet our needs, including no material bond maturities during the current financial year. We plan to fund the growth of the group predominantly from internal sources - recognising the current uncertainties in financial markets - and this will be achieved by reducing capital expenditure to below our operating cash flow. group capital expenditure excluding acquisitions rose to PS4.7bn last year PS3.9bn, slightly higher than the forecast made at our interim Results. this increase compared with last year was attributable principally to the purchase of a small number of trading stores from a competitor and investment in new mixed-use development schemes in the UK, combined with higher international capital expenditure, including our initial investment in freehold shopping centre developments in china. Furthermore, international capital spending, and as a result total group expenditure, was impacted by the decline in sterling relative to most of our trading currencies. UK capital expenditure was PS2.6bn last year PS2.3bn. total international capital expenditure rose to PS2.1bn last year PS1.6bn comprising PS0.9bn in asia, PS0.9bn in europe and PS0.3bn in the Us. com annualreport09 We are now reducing UK capital spend on large mixed-use development schemes and we have purchased fewer existing trading stores from competitors, allowing UK capital expenditure to revert to the levels of four years ago. importantly this is being achieved whilst continuing to meet our objective of adding some 6 to 7% to our UK selling space annually. in some of our markets, such as the Us, we are taking a more cautious approach to expansion during the downturn and we are also seeing substantial falls in store site and build costs. taken together, these changes mean that we are able to plan for group capital expenditure to reduce substantially this year to around PS3.5bn, whilst still delivering strong organic growth in group selling space of around 9% in the current year. cash flow from operating activities totalled PS5.0bn last year PS4.1bn, including an improvement of PS582m within working capital, driven in part by good control of stock. net debt rose to PS9.6bn at the year-end last year PS6.2bn. PS1.9bn of this increase is attributable to the impact of acquiring tpF and Homever, and a further PS1.0bn to the effect of unfavourable currency movements. We are targeting a reduction in net debt in the current year, driven by lower capital expenditure, property divestments, lower stock levels and other improvements in working capital. Property in april 2006, we announced plans to release cash from property through a sequence of joint ventures and other sale and leaseback transactions, in the UK and internationally and return significant value to shareholders, both through enhanced dividends through the growth in underlying earnings per share, which includes property profits and share buy-backs. We have managed the pace of this programme in light of the current financial and property market conditions, and as a result we have divested the property at attractive yields. the transactions completed so far - with pension funds, property companies and other investors - have delivered aggregate proceeds of PS2.2bn. Whilst yields have increased modestly in recent months, we expect to be able to complete further transactions on attractive terms in the months ahead and we are currently in discussion with potential counterparties. proceeds for the remainder of this year will principally be used to pay down debt. the net book value of our fixed tangible assets is PS24.7bn, most of it in our freehold store portfolio - even after recent property divestments linked to our PS5bn programme. We estimate the current market value of these assets to be PS30.4bn, representing a 23% premium to book value. Pensions our award-winning defined-benefit pension scheme is an important part of our competitive benefits package, which helps tesco recruit and retain the best people. the trustees manage and fund our scheme on an actuarial valuation basis and, at our triennial valuation dated 31 march 2008, the scheme had a small deficit of PS275m. Following the valuation, member and company contributions have increased and, to further improve the security of the scheme for members, the trustees will be granted contingent property assets worth PS500m. as at February 2009, under the ias 19 methodology of pension liability valuation, the scheme had a deficit on a post-tax basis of PS1.1bn last year PS0.6bn. this change has been driven mainly by falls in capital markets and other asset classes, although the deficit is similar to the level reported at our interim results. Return on capital employed in January 2004, we said that we had an aspiration to increase our post-tax return on capital employed Roce of 10.2% in the 2002 3 financial year by 200 basis points over five years on then current plans. in april 2006, we renewed our commitment to increasing our post-tax return on capital employed Roce by a further 200 basis points, having exceeded our 2004 aspiration early. Roce rose slightly to 13.0% in the year before the effect of the two major acquisitions - tpF and Homever - which were completed in the second half. this represents a good performance and we remain on track to deliver our targeted Roce improvement in the years ahead as these investments mature. Tesco PLC annual Report and Financial statements 2009 36 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs Key performance indicators We operate a balanced scorecard approach to managing the business that is known internally within the group as our 'steering Wheel'. this unites the group's resources and in particular focuses the efforts of our staff around our customers, people, operations, finance and the community. its prime focus is as a management tool for the company so that there is appropriate balance in the trade-offs that need to be made all the time between the main levers of management - such as operations measures, financial measures or delivery of customer metrics. it therefore enables the business to be operated and monitored on a balanced basis with due regard to the needs of all stakeholders. For the owners of the business, it is simply based around the philosophy that if we look after customers well and operate efficiently and effectively then shareholders' interests will always be best served by the inevitable outputs of those - growth in sales, profits and returns. 2009 2008 Sales growth change in group sales over the year including value added tax 15.1% 11.1% UK sales growth 9.5% 6.7% international sales growth 30.6% 25.3% international sales growth at constant exchange rates 13.6% 22.5% Retailing services sales growth 11% - profit before tax PS2,954m PS2,803m Underlying profit before tax PS3,128m PS2,846m Trading margin UK trading margin 6.2% 5.9% international trading margin excluding the United states 5.3% 5.6% trading margin is calculated from the trading profit expressed as a percentage of group revenue sales excluding value added tax. it is a measure of profit generation from sales and is a comparable performance measure with other companies. this is how much we made from trade in our stores, taking account of the cost of the products sold, wages and salaries, expenses associated with running the stores, depots and head office, and the cost of depreciation of the assets used to generate the profits. trading profit is stated after adjusting operating profit for the impact of ias 19, ias 32 and ias 39 principally pension costs and the marking to market of financial instruments. it also excludes the non-cash elements of ias 17 'leases', relating to the impact of annual uplifts in rents and rent-free periods, and the iFRs 3 amortisation charge on intangible assets arising on the acquisition of tesco personal Finance tpF.

Tesco PLC annual Report and Financial statements 2009 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs 38 Risks and uncertainties Introduction Risk is an accepted part of doing business. the real challenge for any business is to identify the principal risks it faces and to develop and monitor appropriate controls. a successful risk management process balances risks and rewards and relies on a sound judgement of their likelihood and consequence. the Board has overall responsibility for risk management and internal control within the context of achieving the group's objectives. our process for identifying and managing risks is set out in more detail from page 47 of the corporate governance section of this annual Report and Financial statements. the key risks faced by the group and relevant mitigating factors are set out below. Business strategy if our strategy follows the wrong direction or is not effectively communicated then the business may suffer. We need to understand and properly manage strategic risk in order to deliver longterm growth for the benefit of all our stakeholders. our strategy is based on five elements: to become a successful international retailer, to grow the core UK business, be as strong in non-food as in food, develop retailing services and put the community at the heart of what we do. pursuit of this five-part strategy has allowed the business to diversify and, at a strategic level, diversification and pursuit of growth in emerging markets have the effect of reducing overall risk by avoiding reliance on a small number of business areas. However, by its very nature, diversification also introduces new risks to be managed in areas of the business that are less mature and less fully understood. to ensure the group continues to pursue the right strategy, the Board discusses strategic issues at every Board meeting, and dedicates two full days a year to reviewing the group's strategy. the executive committee also holds specific sessions to discuss strategy on a regular basis. We have structured programmes for engaging with all our stakeholders including customers, employees, investors, suppliers, government, media and non-governmental organisations. We also invest significant resources in ensuring our strategy is communicated well and understood by the parties who are key to delivering it. the business operates a steering Wheel - a balanced scorecard process whereby we set goals for different areas of the business and assess our overall progress on a quarterly basis - in all countries and significant business units such as Dotcom to help manage performance and deliver business strategy. Financial strategy and Group treasury risk the main financial risks of the group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. the risks associated with operating tesco personal Finance are covered under Financial services risks below. the treasury function is mandated by the Board to manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs. the function has clear policies and operating parameters, and its activities are routinely reviewed and audited. the function does not operate as a profit centre and the undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted. a description of the role of the Finance committee and internal and external audit is set out in the corporate governance section on page 48. Financial services risks through tesco personal Finance plc formerly tesco personal Finance group limited tpF, the group is subject to certain risks relating to the personal financial services industry in the UK. tpF is subject to significant legislative and regulatory oversight. in particular, tpF is subject to supervision by the Financial services authority Fsa, which has substantial powers of intervention, and is required to satisfy certain capital adequacy and liquidity ratios. if tpF is unable or fails to satisfy these ratios in the future, it could lose its licence and, consequently, its ability to transact business. tpF is subject to various risks associated with the provision of financial services. in relation to its insurance business, tpF may experience a concentration of risks from natural or man-made disasters. in addition, market conditions may not allow tpF to purchase the amount of re-insurance it considers necessary on terms it considers acceptable. actual claims may exceed the claims provisions that have been made on the basis of past experience. tpF's credit card receivables and personal loan portfolio may be subject to changes in credit quality, due to a general deterioration in economic conditions or by failures in its credit assessment process, which could adversely impact its ability to recover amounts due. Furthermore, there is significant competition in the financial services industry, which could adversely affect tpF's market share and profitability. legal developments, changes in legal interpretation or precedent, and changes in public policy may result in new risks emerging in addition to those anticipated. Because tpF is an Fsa-regulated entity, its treasury function is run independently from the rest of the group. tpF's treasury risks include, in particular, liquidity risk and interest rate risk in particular, in the interest rate margin realised between lending and borrowing costs. tpF is also subject to the risk of unexpected losses arising from operational failure, whether as a result of human error, systems failures, fraud or inadequate controls. Operational threats and performance risk in the business there is a risk that our business may not deliver the stated strategy in full, particularly since, like all retailers, the business is susceptible to economic downturn that could affect consumer spending. the continuing acquisition and development of property sites also forms an intrinsic part of our strategy and this carries inherent risks. We try to deliver what customers want better than our competitors by understanding and responding to their behaviour. all of our business units have stretching targets based on the steering Wheel and the performance of business units is monitored continually and reported regularly to the Board. We manage the acquisition and development of our property assets carefully. We consider and assess in detail every site at each stage of acquisition and development and ensure that relevant action is taken to minimise any risks. Competition and consolidation the retail industry is highly competitive. the group competes with a wide variety of retailers of varying sizes and faces increased competition from UK retailers as well as international operators in the UK and overseas. Failure to compete with competitors on areas including price, product range, quality and service could have an adverse effect on the group's financial results. We aim to have a broad appeal in price, range and store format in a way that allows us to compete in different markets. We track performance against a range of measures that customers tell us are critical to their shopping trip experience and we constantly monitor customer perceptions of ourselves and our competitors to ensure we can respond quickly if we need to. People capabilities our greatest asset is our employees. it is critical to our success to attract, retain, develop and motivate the best people with the right capabilities at all levels of operations. We review our people policies regularly and are committed to investing in training and development and incentives for our people. our 'talent planning' process helps individuals achieve their full potential. We also carry out succession planning to ensure that the needs of the business going forward are considered and provided for. there are clear processes for understanding and responding to employees' needs through our people matters group, staff surveys, regular performance reviews, involvement of trade unions in relevant markets and regular communication of business developments. Reputational risk as the largest retailer in the UK, expectations of the group are high. Failure to protect the group's reputation and brand could lead to a loss of trust and confidence. this could result in a decline in the customer base and affect the ability to recruit and retain good people. like other companies we must consider potential threats to our reputation and the consequences of reputational damage. emotional loyalty to the tesco brand has helped us diversify into new areas like retail services and non-food and we recognise the commercial imperative to do the right thing for all our stakeholders and avoid the loss of such loyalty. the 'tesco values' are embedded in the way we do business at every level and our code of ethics guides our behaviour in our dealings with customers, employees and suppliers. Tesco PLC annual Report and Financial statements 2009 39 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs To find out more go to www. com annualreport09 We engage with stakeholders in every sphere to take into account their views and we try to ensure our strategy reflects them. the launch of the community plan in 2006 has demonstrated our commitment to tackling a wide range of societal and environmental issues. We have high level committees, including the executive committee, corporate Responsibility committee and compliance committee, to help guide and monitor our policies. Environmental risks our key environmental risks are related to minimising energy usage in stores and transportation, waste management and our ability to respond to consumer concerns in this area. We develop environmental policy through engaging with key stakeholders and experts in this field to achieve sustainable growth and minimise our environmental impacts. the group's approach is brought together in a consistent manner by the corporate Responsibility committee. policy is reviewed regularly by the compliance committee and corporate Responsibility committee. We recognise the opportunities for competitive advantage through energy efficiency and look for continuous improvement through innovations and better ways to help customers act responsibly towards the environment. Product safety the safety and quality of our products is of paramount importance to tesco as well as being essential for maintaining customer trust and confidence. a breach in confidence could affect the size of our customer base and hence financial results. We have detailed and established procedures for ensuring product integrity at all times, especially for our own-label products. there are strict product safety processes and regular management reports. We work in partnership with suppliers to ensure mutual understanding of the standards required. We also monitor developments in areas such as health, safety and nutrition in order to respond appropriately to changing customer trends and new legislation. We have clear processes for crisis management, pulling together expert teams should we need to respond quickly on issues. Health and safety risks While the safety of our staff and customers is of the utmost importance to us, if we are unable to provide safe environments for our staff and customers this could lead to injuries or loss of life. We operate stringent health and safety processes in line with best practice in our stores, distribution centres and offices, which are monitored and audited regularly. Kpis for preventing health and safety incidents form an intrinsic part of our steering Wheels across the business, and performance against these Kpis is reported quarterly. our group compliance committee and the compliance committees in our international businesses monitor the level of compliance with health and safety laws and our internal policies on a regular basis. Ethical risks in the supply chain millions of people around the world work for direct suppliers to tesco and the supply chain is made of complex relationships - from individual farmers and growers through to processors, manufacturers and distributors. at the heart of our values is our belief that we should treat people as we like to be treated and we have a responsibility to help workers in our supply chain enjoy fair labour standards. We therefore require our suppliers to meet strict criteria on labour standards, and as a founder member of the ethical trading initiative eti we expect all our suppliers to follow the eti base code and guarantee their workers the rights set out within it. there is, however, a risk that any part of the supply chain might not adhere to these high standards. to minimise this risk we only work with suppliers who can demonstrate that they are committed to the eti code and share our values. We use supplier ethical Data exchange seDex to carry out risk assessment of all our direct suppliers and all medium and high-risk suppliers must undergo an extensive, independent ethical audit. We continue to operate a comprehensive programme of audit improvements, including more unannounced audits, a trading Fairly strategy and an industry-leading auditor Recognition programme. We have also sought to involve more multi-stakeholder representatives on our audits to improve workforce engagement and enable activists to see and feedback on our approach. We work with suppliers to identify any problems and, where they exist, support them in taking action to improve standards for their workers. We have also invested heavily in building the labour standards capabilities of our suppliers and our own commercial teams in the last year, including rolling out extensive training, to help them identify and avoid issues before they arise. We also work with businesses, governments, non-governmental organisations ngos and others to tackle complex and systemic problems that we cannot solve on our own. as well as having a key role in the eti we also work closely with the global social compliance programme and other groups in specific industries or regions. Fraud and compliance as the business grows in size and geographical spread, the risk of occurrence of fraudulent behaviour by our employees increases. Whilst the vast majority of our staff are completely honest, there remains the potential for fraud and other dishonest activity at all levels of the business from the shop floor to senior management. the group takes extensive steps to reduce this risk. Relevant accounting and other procedures and controls at all levels are clearly set out and audited across the business to reduce the risk of fraud. the group gives clear guidance on behaviour to employees through the tesco values and the code of ethics. internal audit undertakes detailed investigations into all areas of the business and highlights its findings to the audit committee. the compliance committee formulates and monitors the implementation of, and compliance with appropriate policies on key areas of ethical behaviour, including fraud. Property We have stretching targets for delivering new space in the UK and overseas, and may face challenges in finding suitable sites and obtaining planning or other consents to enable sites to be acquired and developed. the complexity of many of our property developments is increasing, especially the growing number of mixed-use schemes. We also have to comply with design and construction standards which vary significantly from country to country. our property acquisition committees and other related committees in the UK, europe, asia and the Us closely control all aspects of the property acquisition, planning and construction processes, to ensure that applicable standards are met and financial risks are minimised. our group and country compliance committees also monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in all aspects of our property activities. Non-food risks as the proportion of our business represented by non-food products increases, there is a risk that a downturn in consumer confidence may affect the level of demand for products which consumers may regard as non-essential. We make every effort to ensure that our non-food products are competitively priced to offer a broad range of products ranging from value to the luxury end of the market, in order to cater for the needs of as wide a range of customers as possible. IT systems and infrastructure the business is dependent on efficient information technology it systems. any significant failure in the it processes of our retail operations e. g. barcode scanning or supply chain logistics would impact our ability to trade. We recognise the essential role that it plays across our operations in allowing us to trade efficiently and so that we can achieve commercial advantage through implementing it innovations that improve the shopping trip for customers and make life easier for employees. We have extensive controls in place to maintain the integrity and efficiency of our it infrastructure and we share systems from across our international operations to ensure consistency of delivery. Tesco PLC annual Report and Financial statements 2009 RepoRt oF tHe DiRectoRs 40 Risks and uncertainties continued Regulatory and political environment We are subject to a wide variety of regulations in the different countries in which we operate because of the diverse nature of our business. tesco may be impacted by regulatory changes in key areas such as planning laws, trading hours, and tax rules as well as by scrutiny by the competition authorities, who have been carrying out enquiries in the UK, ireland and elsewhere. We may also be impacted by political developments in the countries in which we operate. We consider these uncertainties in the external environment when developing strategy and reviewing performance. We remain vigilant to future changes. as part of our day-to-day operations we engage with governmental and non-governmental organisations to ensure the views of our customers and employees are represented and try to anticipate and contribute to important changes in public policy wherever we operate. Activism and terrorism a major incident or terrorist event incapacitating management, systems or stores could impact on the group's ability to trade. in addition to contingency plans, we have security systems and processes that reflect best practice. Pension risks the group's pension arrangements are an important part of our employees' overall benefits package especially in the UK. We see them as a strong contributor to our ability to attract and retain good people, our group's greatest asset. since the implementation of ias 19 there is a risk that the accounting valuation deficit which is recorded as a liability on the group Balance sheet could increase if returns on corporate bonds are higher than the investment return on the pension scheme's assets. the group has considered its pension risks and has taken action by reducing risk in its investment strategy. Joint venture governance and partnerships as we continue to enter into new partnerships and joint ventures as well as developing existing arrangements, there remains an inherent risk in managing these partnerships and joint ventures. it is more difficult to guarantee the achievement of joint goals that affect our partners and we rely on partners to help achieve such goals. We may also be impacted by reputational issues which affect our partners. We choose partners with good reputations and set out joint goals and clear contractual arrangements from the outset. We monitor performance and governance of our joint ventures and partnerships. Financial review the main financial risks faced by the group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions, fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and credit rating risks. these risks are managed as described below. the group Balance sheet position at 28 February 2009 is representative of the position throughout the year. Funding and liquidity the group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, long and medium-term debt, capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases. the objective is to ensure continuity of funding. the policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities, and a strong credit rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. tesco group has a long-term rating of a3 by moody's and aby standard and poor's with a stable outlook. new funding of PS5.6bn was arranged during the year, including a net PS0.7bn from property transactions and PS4.9bn from medium-term notes mtns. at the year end, net debt was PS9.6bn last year PS6.2bn. Interest rate risk management the objective is to limit our exposure to increases in interest rates while retaining the opportunity to benefit from interest rate reductions. Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and collars are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. the policy is to fix or cap a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs of the group excluding tpF. at the year end, PS6.3bn of debt was in fixed rate form last year PS2.5bn with a further PS0.7bn of debt capped or collared, therefore 72% 2008 - 55% of net debt is fixed, capped or collared. the remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate form. the average rate of interest paid on an historic cost basis excluding joint ventures and associates this year was 5.2% last year 4.5%. Foreign currency risk management our principal objective is to reduce the effect of exchange rate volatility on short-term profits. transactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the group income statement are hedged, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies and currency options. at the year end, forward foreign currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to PS2,110m were outstanding 2008 - PS1,198m as detailed in note 22. We hedge the majority of our investments in our international subsidiaries via foreign exchange transactions in matching currencies. our objective is to maintain a low cost of borrowing and hedge against material movements in our group Balance sheet value. During the year, currency movements increased the net value of the group's overseas assets by PS480m last year increase of PS284m. We translate overseas profits at average foreign exchange rates which we do not currently seek to hedge. Credit risk the objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions across an approved list of counterparties of high credit quality. the group's positions with these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored. Tesco Personal Finance TPF tpF became a wholly owned subsidiary of tesco group on 19 December 2008. in preparation for this change the risk management and treasury capabilities of tpF have been materially strengthened. all policies pertaining to risk within tpF are now subject to tpF governance procedures which are owned by the tpF Board. tpF has a banking business, predominantly in the UK, with the three main products being credit cards, unsecured personal loans and savings. tpF has also developed a significant insurance business, with motor, home and pet insurance being the main products. credit risk, arising from its unsecured lending, is managed using all the normal reporting and collections and recoveries systems. in terms of liquidity risk tpF has implemented a conservative approach to the minimum amount of liquid assets its holds and to its core funding ratio of customer assets customer liabilities. tpF has at this stage in its development an increased element of operational risk as it currently outsources most of its operations to Royal Bank of scotland group whilst at the same time it is in the process of building new banking and insurance systems. tpF retains profit and loss risk to its insurance activities of which a large weather related event would generate the largest adverse variance. Insurance We purchased assets, earnings and combined liability protection from the open insurance market at 'catastrophe' level only. the risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the business by using our captive insurance companies, tesco insurance limited in guernsey and valiant insurance company limited in the Republic of ireland. tesco insurance limited covers assets and earnings, while valiant insurance company limited covers combined liability. Statement of compliance this Business Review has been prepared in accordance with the requirements for a business review under the companies acts 1985 and 2006. the Business Review's intent is to provide information to shareholders and should not be relied on by any other party or for any other purpose. Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking information Where this review contains forward-looking statements, these are made by the Directors in good faith based on the information available to them at the time of their approval of this report. these statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent risks and uncertainties underlying any such forward-looking information. the group cautions investors that a number of important factors, including those in this document, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. such factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed under 'Risks and uncertainties' on pages 38 to 40 of this document.",

Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 2 Strong growth across the Group The breadth of the Group and the strength of our business model have enabled T esco to deliver another year of double-digit sales, profit and earnings per share growth. These results demonstrate that Tesco has again made strong progress. Sales, profits and returns have grown well, the growth has been broadly based and we are delivering on our commitments to shareholders. I believe these numbers also clearly show that our new businesses are coming of age, after years of patient investment. I am pleased about that because the breadth this gives the Group, combined with the strength of our business model, means that we are able to cope well with changing market conditions and at the same time make the necessary investment in our future growth - in the United States, China and Tesco Direct. International is an important part of this. It now makes more than PS700m of trading profit, which is about the same as the whole of Tesco did a decade ago, and it contributed over half of the growth in Group trading profit in the year. We have built a new Tesco in the last ten years, serving markets with hundreds of millions of customers - and I believe its growth prospects are even better than the original's were back then. We saw excellent progress across the international business. Sales and profits grew well, returns rose again but the most striking improvements came in the strengthening positions we have in our chosen markets. We added over six and a half million square feet of new selling space overseas in the year - over three times as much as in the UK. Our focus on combining this organic growth with selective acquisitions is also delivering - in Poland, the Czech Republic and Malaysia - with more to come. Our international business now has the scale, the competitiveness and the momentum it needs to be a key driver of our growth for the long-term - because our operations in most of these markets can be two, three or more times larger than they are today. We have made solid progress in the UK. It hasn't been an easy year for our core business - recovering competitors and cautious consumers made sales growth harder to come by. But with strong productivity, mix and margin control, we delivered good results and after a slower end to the year, we have come into the new financial year on better form, trading ahead of the industry and a little ahead of our planned performance range. I believe we are entering the kind of market conditions where Tesco's strengths stand out: where customers will be looking to us to help them cope with higher bills for mortgages and fuel as well as higher taxes. As always, our focus will therefore be on improving their shopping trip - whether it's in lower prices, shorter queues at checkouts or healthier products to feed the family. Customers recognise the improvements we are making. Whilst we have seen pleasing progress in Non-Food, this has been against a background of more subdued consumer spending in some product categories. Nevertheless, sales grew faster than the core business, profitability was strong and we saw good market share gains. Our core general merchandise categories, which are less sensitive to the economic cycle, grew well and we saw robust growth in newer areas such as electricals, furniture and DIY, helped in part by an excellent first full year of trading in Tesco Direct, our online and catalogue non-food business. Our Services businesses had another good year - again demonstrating the growing breadth of the Group - supported by our increasing strength as a leading internet retailer. Dotcom was on excellent form, with sales in our online business again up by over 30%. Tesco Telecoms performed well, driven by a very good performance in Tesco Mobile, our joint venture with O2, which moved into profit for the first time in the year. Elsewhere in Services, Tesco Personal Finance TPF, which celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, has got back to a faster rate of growth, driven by a strong sequence of new product launches and a 20% rise in online sales. TPF has also weathered a difficult financial services market well - with falling bad debts and credit card arrears. But for the impact of last year's floods on household insurance claims, we would have seen strong profit growth from TPF. Our work with communities and the environment has also seen Tesco make encouraging progress. To make sure this work gets the right focus and priority in the business, we made an important change in 2007 by adding it to our four-part strategy for growth - so making Community the fifth element. As the first change of any kind to Tesco's strategy in more than a decade, this represents a very significant commitment. More detail about our initiatives in this area can be found elsewhere in this report, in our separate Corporate Responsibility Review and on our website www. We are making strides towards a revolution in green consumption by incentivising the environmental option and making it affordable. We do not start from the position that it is a choice between growing or being green: that somehow we will give up a bit of potency in the focus of the business in pursuing these things. My strong belief is that this is not the case, and that being green will be a good way to grow and add value for shareholders whilst discharging our responsibilities to other stakeholders. That is why Tesco has taken a lead on these matters. Some key milestones passed this year included the early achievement of our target to reduce the number of free carrier bags issued to UK customers by 25% in a little over 12 months - saving well over one billion bags, far more than any other retailer. We are on track to save two billion this year. We have also halved our energy use per square foot of selling space since 2000, two years ahead of target. We have invested PS25m in creating a Sustainable Consumption Institute at the University of Manchester, bringing together world-leading experts from various disciplines. The Institute will help lead the way to a low-carbon economy and society. We plan to begin a programme of carbon labelling of our products in the early weeks of the current year, using our experience of putting clear, useful information in front of customers to help them make informed decisions about the CO2 implications of their product choices. In summary: Tesco is about growth and we are confident of sustaining strong growth in the future: we do this by following the customer: as they change, we change and this means our growth is broadly based, as our new businesses come through to scale and profitability: it also means we can carry the costs of investing now in the new products and businesses which will drive our long-term growth: at the same time we can deliver improving returns and tangible benefits for shareholders: we are meeting our responsibilities to other stakeholders by playing an innovative part in tackling some of the social and environmental challenges we all face: we have delivered strong results by making shopping better for customers: and Tesco is equipped to cope with changing market conditions and, whilst the current global economic background is a concern, we begin the new financial year with confidence.

Business Review This Business Review analyses the performance of the Tesco Group in the financial year ended 23 February 2008. It also explains other aspects of the Group's markets, results and operations, including strategy and risk management. Long-term strategy Tesco has a well-established and consistent strategy for growth, which has allowed us to strengthen our core UK business and drive expansion into new markets. The rationale for the strategy is to broaden the scope of the business to enable it to deliver strong sustainable long-term growth by following the customer into large expanding markets at home - such as financial services, non-food and telecoms - and new markets abroad, initially in Central Europe and Asia, and now also in the United States. The strategy to diversify the business was laid down in 1997 and has been the foundation of Tesco's success in recent years. The new businesses which have been created and developed over the last decade as part of this strategy now have scale, they are competitive and profitable - in fact, the International business alone makes about the same profit as the entire Group did a decade ago. The Group has continued to make progress with this strategy, which now has five elements, reflecting our four established areas of focus, and also Tesco's long-term commitments on community and environment. The objectives of the strategy are: to grow the core UK business: to become a successful international retailer: to be as strong in non-food as in food: to develop retailing services - such as Tesco Personal Finance, Telecoms and tesco. com: and to put community at the heart of what we do. In 2007 8, Tesco has again delivered a strong performance, with all parts of the strategy contributing. We have sustained good growth in the UK and coped well with the challenges of poor weather, recovering competitors, and a deteriorating consumer background. In our international operations we have also made excellent progress, completing a large programme of new store openings and overcome difficult conditions in some of our largest markets. We have also begun operations on the west coast of the United States with our Fresh & Easy stores. In non-food, more customers are choosing to shop with us even in a period of more cautious consumer spending and we have seen good growth from Tesco Direct, which extends our reach in selling a broad range of products on the internet and via a catalogue. Our retailing services have delivered another good year, with tesco. com sustaining its rapid growth, Tesco Personal Finance making progress in challenging markets and Telecoms continuing to build its customer base strongly and moving into profitability. Finally, we are making strides towards a revolution in green consumption, having reduced carrier bag use by over one billion - more than any other retailer and are on target to sell ten million energy efficient lightbulbs in a year as part of the Climate Group's 'Together' campaign. Markets served and business model Tesco's growth, driven by this strategy, has been predominantly organic and we have used our skills and knowledge in understanding customers, property development, supply chain management, new product development, store formatting and how to localise our offer - to create strong business models in our chosen markets. Where we do not have all the required skills ourselves to be successful, we regularly partner with existing businesses - and these relationships have formed the basis of some of our most successful operations - for example with Samsung in South Korea and with the Royal Bank of Scotland in T esco Personal Finance. The UK grocery retail market remains our largest source of revenue, representing some 46% of last year's PS51.8bn of sales. International retail sales - from our 12 markets in Europe, Asia and the United States, comprise a further 19% of Group revenues and non-food in a variety of categories from health and beauty to electronics accounts for most of the remainder. Our services businesses - not least in financial services and telecoms - have comparatively small revenue streams because some of the most important of them are joint-ventures but they are increasingly material to our earnings base. At the core of Tesco's business model is a focus on trying to improve what we do for customers. We aim to make their shopping experience as easy as possible, lower prices where we can to help them spend less, give them more choice about how they shop - in small stores, large stores or online, and seek to bring simplicity and value to sometimes complicated markets. And we aim to be a good neighbour in the communities we serve, be responsible, fair and honest in our dealings and give customers the information and products they need to make greener choices. We are also an inclusive business - everyone is welcome at Tesco. Because we are a discounter, underpinning this approach is a relentless attitude to being the lowest cost provider of goods and services in our chosen sectors - and this combination of qualities is the reason we have been successful in some of the world's most competitive markets. We have recognised skills and proprietory systems in key areas which help us deliver a low cost model - particularly in customer relationship management, justin-time supply chain and distribution, property development and store formatting. In some of our newer markets - such as telecoms or financial services, our willingness to partner with established businesses has given us access to their existing investment in systems and infrastructure and enabled Tesco to develop competitive, profitable business models quickly and, at the same time, limit our own investment and risk in the early years.

We have been able to deliver another solid sales performance, and through good cost control and productivity improvements, we have grown profits slightly faster than revenue - and thereby improved returns for shareholders. These improvements have been achieved whilst continuing to invest in the long term - in the people, assets, processes and systems, which will enable Tesco to sustain its success in the future. Results These results are for the 52 weeks ended 23 February 2008, compared with the same period ending in February 2007. Results from our business in China are consolidated in the full-year results for the first time. Group sales, including VAT, increased by 11.1% to PS51.8bn last year PS46.6bn. At constant exchange rates, sales increased by 10.4%. In April 2006, with our Preliminary Results for 2005 6, and following our transition to IFRS, we introduced an underlying profit measure, which excludes the impact of the non-cash elements of IAS 19, IAS 32 and IAS 39 principally pension costs and the marking to market of financial instruments. With these Results, the underlying profit measure also excludes the impact of the non-cash element of IAS 17 'Leases', relating to the impact of annual uplifts in rent and rent free periods. Underlying profit before tax rose to PS2,846m in the year last year PS2,545m, an increase of 11.8%. With our Interim Results for 2006 7, we began reporting segmental trading profit, which excludes property profits and, as our underlying profit measure does, excludes the non-cash element of the IAS 19 pension charge and now also excludes the non-cash element of the IAS 17 lease charge. Group trading profits were PS2,751m last year PS2,478m, up 11.0% on last year and Group trading margin, at 5.8%, was unchanged on last year. Group operating profit rose by 5.4% to PS2,791m last year PS2,648m. Within this, total net Group property profits were PS188m in the year last year PS139m, including asset disposals within joint ventures, comprising PS186m in the UK and PS2m in International. Group profit before tax increased 5.7% to PS2,803m last year PS2,653m. Excluding last year's exceptional items: principally the Pensions A-Day credit, Group profit before tax rose 15.3% and Group operating profit rose 15.1%.

Total International sales grew strongly - by 25.3% at actual exchange rates to PS13.8bn last year PS11.0bn and by 22.5% at constant exchange rates.

Central Europe overall delivered strong growth. Despite the subdued economy in Hungary, our business delivered a pleasing increase in profit and resumed positive growth in like-for-like sales last summer. Excellent performances in Turkey and Ireland were held back by planned commissioning costs for new large central distribution centres, both of which opened in the first half. Europe results Actual rates Actual rates Constant Europe sales inc. VAT PS7,836m 23.9% 16.1% Europe trading profit PS397m 24.8% 18.6% Trading margin 5.8% - - UK Our core business performed well in challenging market conditions. UK sales increased by 6.7% to PS37.9bn last year PS35.6bn with like-for-like growth of 3.9% including volume of 2.0% and 2.8% from net new stores. Excluding petrol, like-for-like sales grew by 3.5%. In our stores, we saw modest inflation of 1.2% for the year as a whole, with our continued investment in lowering prices for customers being offset by the strength of market prices for commodities and some seasonal fresh foods. Further rises in commodity food prices in the second half saw inflation rise to just over 2% in our fourth quarter with food price inflation being offset by continuing deflation in non-food categories. The pattern of our trading during the year was unusual. Unseasonal summer weather impacted growth in the first half, and a combination of recovering competitors and more subdued customer demand in some non-food product categories, held back sales progress in the second half. Increased productivity and good expense control enabled us to maintain solid margins and deliver good profit growth despite these challenges, whilst also absorbing initial operating losses totalling around PS90m on Tesco Direct and on establishing our operations in the US. Even after these additional costs, UK trading profit rose 7.1% to PS2,050m, with trading margins at 5.9%, slightly up on last year. UK results 2007 8 Growth UK sales inc. VAT PS37,949m 6.7% UK trading profit PS2,050m 7.1% Trading margin 5.9% - EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortisation charges of PS357m to International operating profit of PS694m. 212584 TESCO REP P1 17 1 5 08 19:34 Page 5 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 6 Joint ventures and associates Our share of profit net of tax and interest for the year was PS75m, a decrease of PS31m compared with last year. Driving this decrease was a PS47m property profit last year, principally reflecting profit realised on the sale of the Weston Favell store to a third party. Excluding these property-related items, profits from joint ventures rose by PS16m. Tesco Personal Finance TPF profit was PS128m, of which our share was PS64m. This was after absorbing PS31m of higher household insurance claims linked to last summer's flooding in Yorkshire and the Midlands. Tesco's share of the cost of higher claims linked to these events was PS11m after interest and tax in the year as a whole. Underlying growth in the business was therefore encouraging, with the new management team demonstrating that there remains significant growth potential for TPF within the financial services sector, particularly amongst loyal Tesco customers, as we build our portfolio of products. TPF is well-provisioned for bad and doubtful debts - which are down yearon-year and we also continue to see improving trends in credit card arrears. Finance costs and tax Net finance costs were PS63m last year PS126m, reflecting favourable movements in the non-cash IFRS elements of the interest charge. The interest charge, excluding IFRS adjustments and finance income, rose 18%. Total Group tax has been charged at an effective rate of 24.0% last year 29.1%. This reduction in tax rate is primarily due to a one-off tax reimbursement, reflecting settlement of prior year tax items with HMRC. We have also benefited from an adjustment of deferred tax balances as a result of the lowering of the rate of UK corporation tax from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008. We expect the effective tax rate for the current year to be around 27.5%. Underlying diluted earnings per share increased by 20.8% to 27.02p last year 22.36p, benefiting from the significantly lower than normal effective tax rate for the year and from the elimination of earnings dilution linked to new share issuance, resulting from our share buy-back programme. On a normalised 28.9% tax rate basis, underlying diluted earnings per share rose by 13.1%. Dividend The Board has proposed a final dividend of 7.70p per share last year 6.83p. This represents an increase of 12.7%, and takes the fullyear increase in dividend to 13.1%. This increase in dividend is in line with the growth in underlying diluted earnings per share, which are inclusive of net property profits, using our normalised tax rate of 28.9%. Going forward, we intend to continue to grow annual dividends broadly in line with underlying diluted earnings per share growth. The final dividend will be paid on 4 July 2008 to shareholders on the Register of Members at the close of business on 25 April 2008. Shareholders have the opportunity to elect to reinvest their cash dividend and purchase existing Tesco shares in the Company through a Dividend Reinvestment Plan. This scheme replaced the scrip dividend at the time of the Interim Results in 2006 and was introduced to reduce dilution from new share issuance and improve earnings per share. Cash flow and Balance Sheet Group capital expenditure excluding acquisitions rose to PS3.9bn last year PS3.0bn : higher than the PS3.5bn forecast at our Interim Results. This increase was attributable to the purchase of a small number of UK trading stores from a competitor, investment in new mixed-use development schemes during the second half and higher International capital expenditure. UK capital expenditure was PS2.5bn last year PS1.9bn, including PS987m on new stores, PS457m on extensions and refits and approximately PS200m relating to our US operations, slightly below the guidance we gave last November. Total International capital expenditure rose to PS1.4bn last year PS1.1bn comprising PS0.7bn in Asia and PS0.7bn in Europe. We expect Group capital expenditure to rise this year, driven largely by the expansion of our International business, to around PS4.2bn. This growth will primarily arise from the increased scale of our investment in freehold shopping centre developments in China. The change in the status of our investment in China to a subsidiary, means that such developments will now be fully funded directly from Tesco's balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities, including an improvement of PS194m within working capital, totalled PS4.1bn last year PS3.5bn. Net borrowings rose to PS6.2bn at the year end last year PS4.9bn. PS0.6bn of this increase is attributable to the effect of unfavourable currency movements on our International balance sheet hedging Sterling has depreciated by 11.5% against the currencies of the countries in which we operate. A further PS0.3bn relates to acquisitions, including our share of Dobbies Garden Centres PLC. Pensions Our award-winning defined-benefit pension scheme is an important part of our competitive package of pay and benefits, which helps Tesco recruit and retain the best people. We manage and fund our scheme on an actuarial valuation basis and, as at December 2007, the scheme was estimated to be broadly fully funded. As at February 2008, under the IAS 19 methodology of pension liability valuation, the Group pension deficit on a post-tax basis was PS603m. Return on capital employed In January 2004, we said that we had an aspiration to increase our post-tax return on capital employed ROCE of 10.2% in the 2002 3 financial year by 200 basis points over five years on then current plans. In April 2006, we renewed our commitment to increasing our post-tax return on capital employed ROCE by a further 200 basis points, having exceeded our 2004 aspiration early. ROCE rose to 12.9% in the year, using a normalised tax rate, before start-up costs on the US and Tesco Direct and the impact of foreign exchange equity and our acquisition of a majority share in Dobbies last year ROCE was 12.6%, excluding the Pensions A-Day credit. This represents a good performance and we remain on track to deliver our targeted ROCE improvement in the years ahead as these investments mature. com annualreport08 Business Review continued 212584 TESCO REP P1 17 1 5 08 19:34 Page 6 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 7 Current trading We have seen a strong start to the new financial year across the Group. In the UK, our planned investments in strengthening further our offer for customers, involving our latest round of price cuts and the introduction of stronger promotions - and at the same time continuing to improve availability and service standards - have gone well. UK like-for-like sales growth, excluding petrol, was over 4% in the first five weeks of the new year. This figure is adjusted for the different timing of Easter this year and is a little ahead of our planned performance range of between 3% and 4% for the year as a whole. Within this, inflation was under 1.5%. International sales progress has also been pleasing. Sales growth was strong - 19% at actual rates in the first five weeks. Overall, growth moderated only slightly compared with last year despite passing the anniversary of the acquisition of both Leader Price in Poland and the majority holding in our business in China. Total Group sales increased by 13% in the same period. Releasing value from property Our PS5bn-plus programme of releasing value from property through a sequence of joint ventures and other transactions and return significant cash to shareholders over five years, both through enhanced dividends and share buy-backs, is on track. The two transactions completed in 2007 delivered aggregate proceeds of PS1.2bn. The first of these deals, with the British Airways Pension Fund, was completed at the end of the 2006 7 financial year. A second, larger joint venture transaction was completed with The British Land Company PLC in March 2007 and our reported first half property profits largely reflected the significant book profit on this transaction. We completed a third such deal in February 2008 - with Prudential plc - on a 4.8% yield, realising proceeds of PS207m. The premium to bookvalue on this transaction was 66%. Whilst yields have increased modestly in recent months, appetite for Tesco's property and covenant remains strong, and if market conditions remain conducive, we expect to be able to complete further transactions on attractive terms in the months ahead. We are currently in discussion with potential counterparties. Proceeds will continue to be used to fund expansion and our share buy-back programme - which has already re-purchased T esco shares worth over PS1.1bn. The net bookvalue of our fixed assets is PS19.8bn, most of it in our freehold store portfolio - even after recent property divestments linked to our PS5bn programme. We estimate the current market value of these assets to be PS31bn, representing a 57% premium to bookvalue. Key performance indicators KPIs We operate a balanced scorecard approach to managing the business that is known internally within the Group as our 'Steering Wheel'. This unites the Group's resources and in particular focuses the efforts of our staff around our customers, people, operations, finance and the community. Its prime focus is as a management tool for the company so that there is appropriate balance in the trade-offs that need to be made all the time between the main levers of management - such as operations measures, financial measures or delivery of customer metrics. It therefore enables the business to be operated and monitored on a balanced basis with due regard to the needs of all stakeholders. For the owners of the business, it is simply based around the philosophy that if we look after customers well and operate efficiently and effectively then shareholders' interests will always be best served by the inevitable outputs of those - growth in sales, profits and returns. 212584 TESCO REP P1 17 1 5 08 19:34 Page 7 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 8 2008 2007 Sales growth Change in Group sales over the year including value added tax 11.1% 10.9% UK sales growth 6.7% 9.0% International sales growth 25.3% 17.9% International sales growth at constant exchange rates 22.5% 17.4% Profit before tax PS2,803 PS2,653m Underlying profit before tax PS2,846 PS2,545m Trading margin UK trading margin 5.9% 5.9% International trading margin 5.6% SS 5.7% Trading margin is calculated from the trading profit expressed as a percentage of Group revenue sales excluding value added tax.

This is how much we made from trade in our stores, taking account of the cost of the products sold, wages and salaries, expenses associated with running the stores, depots and head office, and the cost of depreciation of the assets used to generate the profits. Trading profit is stated after adjusting operating profit for the impact of IAS 19, IAS 32 and IAS 39 principally pension costs and the marking to market of financial instruments. It also excludes the non-cash elements of IAS 17 'Leases', relating to the impact of annual uplifts in rents and rent-free periods.

We monitor a wide range of KPIs, both financial and non-financial. Individual business units have their own versions of the Steering Wheel which incorporate their own priorities and KPIs. Some of the Group KPIs below are tracked through the Steering Wheel and those above are tracked as a monitor of investor return. Across the Group, KPIs are set for local markets, with oversight from the Executive Directors, to ensure they are tailored to drive the priorities of each business. During the last year we have made good progress with rolling out our Corporate Responsibility management system to our International operations. We report quarterly on Community, which includes social, ethical and environmental matters alongside Customer, Operations, Finance and People KPIs. More detail on each country follows in the 'Operations, resources and relationships' section. The following are some KPIs for the UK and Group operations: 2008 2007 UK market share Grocery market share 21.8% 21.0% Non-food market share 8.5% 8.0% This is measured as the share of all spend by all shoppers through Taylor Nelson Sofres Superpanel Total Till Roll data. Supplier viewpoint measure UK 92% 94% The Group 88% N A We aim to monitor supplier relations through the Supplier Viewpoint Survey. The target is for over 90% of UK suppliers to view Tesco as being trustworthy, reliable, consistent, clear, helpful and fair. This is the first year our international suppliers have taken part in our Supplier Viewpoint Survey. Employee retention 84% 84% This measure shows the percentage of employees who have stayed with the business for longer than one year. It is one measure that we use to monitor employee loyalty and satisfaction and we aim to exceed 80% retention of experienced staff. CO2 emissions 5.8% n a For 2007 8 our target was to reduce CO2 emissions from our existing buildings in the UK by 5.5%. Our previous KPI was energy consumption, with our target in 2006 7 being to reduce energy consumption by 12%. 212584 TESCO REP P1 17 1 5 08 19:34 Page 9 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 10 www. com annualreport08 Operations, resources and relationships International operations The performance of our international businesses has been outstanding - with excellent progress in sales, profits and returns. The growing strength of our operations and market positions internationally gives us confidence that we can deliver further strong progress in the years ahead. Our International diversification has come of age and, in delivering half of the year's Group trading profit growth, it has demonstrated its increased strength and maturity - with much more to come. We are seeing the benefits of last year's acquisitions, and organic growth in selling space also continues to be rapid as we build out our networks. We opened a total of 6.2m square feet in Europe and Asia during the year, an increase of 15%, plus a further 0.5m square feet in the US. Over 60% of Group sales area is now in International. At the end of February, our operations in Asia and Europe were trading from 1,561 stores, including 493 hypermarkets, with a total of 45.9m square feet of selling space. This year, we plan to open 505 new stores with a total of 8.4m square feet of sales area in these markets. A further 1.5m square feet is planned to open in the US. Returns - CROI All our established markets are now profitable and with growing local scale, increasing store maturity and the benefits of new investment in supply chain infrastructure, returns from our international operations are continuing to rise. On a constant currency basis and excluding China, cash return on investment CROI for International was the same as last year at 11.5%. This reflects the rise in invested capital linked to our acquisitions in Poland and the Czech Republic in 2006 and higher capital expenditure. Like-for-like CROI shows a strong improvement, rising to 13.1% last year 12.7%, with our lead markets maintaining significantly higher levels overall. Returns in Turkey and Malaysia have shown pleasing improvement. In Central Europe, Hungary and Slovakia delivered increases in returns, while the performance in Poland and the Czech Republic was held back temporarily by the additional capital linked to our acquisitions in 2006. Asia We have delivered a very strong performance in Asia, despite retail markets in our two largest countries - South Korea and Thailand - remaining subdued. We are now market leader in Malaysia, just seven years after we entered the country and we are accelerating growth and investment in China now that we have full control of our business there. In China, with majority ownership and full management control of the business, we have begun to accelerate store and infrastructure development as part of our long-term strategy to become a leader in the market. We plan to construct large multi-level freehold shopping centres, built around Tesco hypermarkets, in the major cities of the three main economic regions - around Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen Guangzhou. These regions will each have modern distribution and supply chain facilities. We now have 56 hypermarkets, mostly around Shanghai and our first stores in the other regions are trading well. The first four of our new large developments will be constructed in the current year. We saw strong sales, including good like-for-like growth in the year and China made a modest profit. The retailing environment in Japan remains difficult. Our small but profitable business there has continued to focus on refining and developing the trial Express-type stores, which we began to open last year - with seven now trading - into an expandable format. We have strengthened the management team in Japan, invested in infrastructure and plan a modest new store development programme this year. Cash return on investment CROI is measured as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, expressed as a percentage of net invested capital. Homeplus in South Korea delivered another excellent performance in the year: overcoming the challenges of stronger competitors and subdued consumer spending and achieving solid sales and strong profit growth. Over 1 million square feet of space was opened during the year and we have a strong programme of 76 new stores and 1.4m square feet this year. We will almost double the size of our Express business in 2008 9 to around 130 stores. Our grocery dotcom operation in South Korea is now well-established and growing rapidly - with sales up by more than 125% in the year. Tesco Malaysia has made rapid progress, successfully integrating and converting the Makro stores and at the same time sustaining very strong like-for-like growth and moving into profitability for the first time. Six major refits to the Makro stores to introduce the new Extra format, which was developed specifically for these sites, are complete and the stores are trading very well. We have recently become market leader, and with two more converted stores to be relaunched soon, plus a strong pipeline of eight planned new hypermarkets, we hope to extend our lead this year. Tesco Lotus in Thailand has performed very well. Although consumer confidence levels remain subdued, our investment in improving our offer for customers through the political and economic instability of the last 18 months has served us well. Our business has achieved good sales and profit growth and strengthened its already robust market position. The successful development and rollout of our formats has picked up pace again with 106 stores opening with 1.4m square feet of selling area. This included the opening of ten hypermarkets in the final quarter of the year. Europe Our European growth has been stronger than for many years, helped in part by favourable exchange rate movements. In Central Europe we are emerging from a long period of economic instability and intense competition as one of the clear winners across the region - and the prospects for improving returns as we continue to build our market positions, and benefit from increased scale, regional economies and improved infrastructure, have never been better. The work we have done on pan-European sourcing of Tesco own brand and general merchandise has further strengthened our competitive position in the region. Our business in Ireland has also made excellent progress and we are increasingly confident about the scale of opportunity for Tesco in Turkey as we build on the excellent Kipa brand, which has already proven itself capable of trading well across much of the country. In the Czech Republic, the benefits of our improved market position - we are now among the leaders - and stability following the very successful acquisition and integration of the Carrefour stores last year are starting to come through well. The performance of the acquired stores has been excellent - with second year like-for-like sales growth of 11%. Our first Express stores have also been well-received by customers in central Prague and we are continuing a programme of refits - and in some cases major redevelopments - of our department stores. The economic background in Hungary is showing early signs of improvement although the consumer environment remains challenging. However, our strategy of investing hard to build on our already strong market position by lowering prices and expanding our store network is yielding good results. We have seen improving performance from our stores, including a resumption of like-for-like sales growth last summer, renewed profit growth and a significant improvement in returns. Our new store opening programme delivered a 12% increase in our space - through four large hypermarkets, five of our 3k compact format, 12 1k stores and one Express. Business Review continued 212584 TESCO REP P1 17 1 5 08 19:34 Page 10 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 11 Our business in Poland had a good year with strong growth in market share, driven by the successful integration and conversion of the former Leader Price stores, combined with organic expansion across our range of 1k, 2k and 3k formats. In a difficult consumer and business environment, sales grew well - with like-for-like growth of 43% in the converted stores. Returns are expected to move forward in the current year as the business absorbs the additional capital involved in last year's acquisition and delivers the full benefits of the enlarged business and the increasing profitability of the converted stores. An excellent performance from Tesco Ireland produced another year of strong growth, with good progress in all areas of the business. The planned operational benefits from our new 740,000 square feet distribution centre DC at Donabate, in north Dublin, which opened in the first half, are now coming through well. Our pipeline of new space is strong - through store extensions, new and replacement stores. We now have six Extra hypermarkets trading in Ireland, which are proving very popular with customers and 12 Express stores - with more to come this year. Our new non-food ranges - including Florence & Fred and Cherokee clothing - are performing particularly well. In Slovakia our new clothing and hardlines distribution centres, located close to Bratislava, which handle general merchandise for the whole of Central Europe, are now fully operational and delivering significant benefits. These substantial investments are enabling our Central European businesses to harmonise and improve our non-food ranges and deliver lower prices for customers. Our market-leading retail business there has made very good progress against the background of a strong economy. Our new store opening programme, which is now focused on our compact hypermarket and smaller 1k formats, delivered 9% growth in selling area in the year. In Turkey, our Kipa business continues to grow rapidly and profitably and we are making progress towards creating a national chain of hypermarkets in a market which offers great potential. We are investing in creating the necessary infrastructure for long-term expansion with our first major distribution centre at Yasibasi covering 400,000 square feet, now in operation and with similar infrastructure projects planned over the next two years as we begin to secure sites in Istanbul, Ankara and the other cities in central and western Turkey. We aim to grow our space in Turkey by around 60% this year, from our base of 26 hypermarkets. Customer response to the Express format has been very encouraging and we plan to add more than 40 further stores this year, bringing the total to over 80. United States We are very encouraged by the start Fresh & Easy has made. The first stores opened only in November and we now have over 60 trading. Whilst it is still early days, the response of customers to our offer has surpassed our expectations - with our research regularly confirming that they like the quality and freshness of our ranges, as well as the prices and the convenient locations of the stores. Sales are ahead of budget and sales densities are already higher than the US supermarket industry average, with our best stores exceeding $20 per square foot per week. We are seeing strong growth in the early stores as we step up, as planned, our marketing programmes and as we build awareness of the brand. This is also reflected in the strong sales performance of recent openings in all of our markets in Southern California, Nevada and Arizona. Fresh foods and own brand products have sold particularly well, confirming that the core of our offer has already gained acceptance with customers. Progress with real estate has been good and we have secured enough sites for our immediate needs - although the deteriorating property market, particularly in Arizona and Nevada, will mean that some of the third-party developments in which we had planned to open prototype stores later this year, will now be deferred. Nevertheless, we still expect to open around 150 new stores this year. Our Riverside distribution centre DC and kitchen operation is gearing up well as volumes rise. As we announced last November, we have taken the necessary steps to secure the site and begin the process of obtaining the necessary permits to launch operations of our second DC in Northern California in due course. We expect a proportion of these costs will be incurred in the current year. Last April, with our Preliminary Results, we said that costs of recruitment and training of staff for the stores, combined with the other pre-launch costs and initial trading losses, would involve estimated US start-up costs of around PS65m in the financial year. We have delivered on this guidance - trading losses were PS62m. We expect losses to rise this year to around PS100m. US segmental reporting of sales and trading results within International will begin with our Interim Results in September. Core UK operations In the UK, Tesco coped well with unseasonal summer weather, recovering competitors and a deteriorating non-food market, particularly in the second half, to deliver solid progress in the year by investing in improving the shopping trip for customers. UK sales grew by 6.7%, with a like-forlike increase, including petrol, of 3.9%. Both customer numbers and spend per visit increased. In the current year we expect to trade the business harder and give what help we can to families whose budgets have become increasingly stretched by higher interest rates, fuel costs and taxes. As always, we are investing to improve all aspects of the shopping trip. We have already announced a significant - and budgeted - round of price cuts, involving an investment of PS170m and this is in addition to the strengthened programme of half-price and other promotions we have been running since January. Every Little Helps Our Price Check survey, which compares 10,000 prices against our leading competitors weekly, shows that our price position has improved again for more information see www. We have already cut the price of 7,500 products this year and in the last decade, Tesco has saved a typical household PS5,000 by investing in even lower prices for customers. We are able to monitor and improve our checkout service using our new thermal imaging technology. A renewed focus on reducing queues for customers has delivered significant improvements - with a remarkable 22.5 million more customers benefiting from our 'one-in-front' promise. Customers recognise Tesco as offering the best checkout service in the market. The broad appeal of the Tesco brand drives our work on ranges. We have seen solid growth across our food categories. We launched a comprehensive update of our Healthy Living range in January - and customer feedback has been very good. Our Organics range is still growing well and Finest is now the UK's biggest brand - with sales of PS1.2 billion. Last week, we did our first big event of the year on Value, delivering great prices for customers right across the store. On-shelf availability, which we measure using our in-store picking of tesco. com orders, has improved again and more customers are able to buy everything they want when they shop at Tesco. We have made particularly strong progress on fresh availability with projects including better weather forecasting and working with our suppliers to reduce lead times. All 7,000 of our eligible own-brand products now carry our GDA nutritional signpost labels. We have created a system that is easy to understand and practical to use and sales data confirms we have made a genuine impact on customer behaviour. 212584 TESCO REP P1 17 1 5 08 19:34 Page 11 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 12 Step-Change We delivered efficiency savings of well over PS350m in the year, significantly ahead of plan, through our Step-Change programme, which brings together many initiatives to make what we do better for customers, simpler for staff and cheaper for Tesco. We have picked up the pace of a number of these often long-term cross-functional projects and plan to deliver even higher savings in the current year of around PS450m. Most of these savings are reinvested to improve our offer for customers. Some examples of these projects are: We have stepped up our investment in energy saving across the business, delivering significant reductions in consumption and helping us to absorb rising utility costs. Savings in supply chain from further improvements in shelf-ready merchandising, increased vehicle utilisation and more productive work methods in depots and stores have risen, with more to come. The introduction of new checkout technology for stores, which is faster, more accurate and easier for staff, has continued to reduce costs and improve customer service. We now have nearly 3,000 employees at our Hindustan Support Centre in Bangalore, India, which provides IT and administrative support to our UK and International operations - from software development to management accounting and payroll. New space We opened a total of 2.0m square feet of new sales area, of which 489,000 square feet was in-store extensions, principally for Extra. We opened another 19 Extra hypermarkets - nine from extensions to existing stores, ten from new stores, bringing the total to 166, with a further 11 planned this year. Extra now represents 41% of our total sales area. We also opened 17 new superstores and 103 new Express stores, bringing the overall total number of Tesco stores to 1,608. Competition Commission We are continuing to work with the Competition Commission on the final stages of their inquiry into the grocery industry. We look forward to the publication shortly of their final report. This is a very competitive industry from which consumers benefit hugely. We hope that the regulatory authorities will give due weight to this and to the need to avoid costly and burdensome new regulation, which discourages the pace of innovation that has served the industry and consumers so well. Non-food operations Tesco's general merchandise business has been resilient despite the challenges posed by weakening demand in a number of categories - and it remains an important contributor to our growth as we improve our offer for customers to drive market share. Because our customers increasingly recognise the quality, breadth and value of our offer, Tesco non-food sales, whilst growing less rapidly than in previous years, remained robust and again grew faster than our core business, helped by a successful first full season for Tesco Direct. Sales growth in the UK was 9% in the year, with total non-food sales increasing to PS8.3bn included in reported UK sales. Sales growth moderated in the second half, but in reducing to 8% growth after a 10% increase in the first half, we were able to outperform strongly the market for general merchandise as a whole. We saw particularly pleasing growth in hardlines, whilst clothing sales, though well ahead of the market, grew more slowly - by 6% in the year as a whole. Including PS3.5bn in International, where sales grew by 20% at constant prices, Group non-food sales rose 12% to PS11.8bn. Entertainment sales strengthened during the second half, helped by a stronger programme of new DVD and games releases. The transition to in-house sourcing of our entertainment offer has gone well. Health & beauty also saw an improving trend. Consumer electronics saw very strong growth 31%, with particularly large increases in the sales of flat-screen televisions, laptop computers and digital cameras. Other strong categories include DIY, furniture and books. Tesco Direct Our new general merchandise business, which is designed to extend the reach of our non-food offer by making it more available to customers who cannot access one of our Extra stores, is now established and thriving. We started Tesco Direct in a low-key way - with initially 8,000 products offered online and 1,500 by catalogue, including new categories such as furniture and last March, we successfully launched a more comprehensive offer. Our latest catalogue, the third of our big books, which was launched last month, demonstrates the growing strength of our offer. We have 11,000 products online and 7,000 in the catalogue. The breadth of range is similar but we have refined the mix of products, increasing the proportion of higher ticket items. Service levels and availability for customers have also seen steady improvement. Customer response has been very positive with order volumes rising season by season. As well as wider ranges, Tesco Direct provides customers with the choice of ordering online, by phone or in selected stores and the option to pick up items from some stores is proving very popular. We have desks in 200 stores with plans to add a further 80 by the end of the year, which will mean that most areas of the country will be served. Sales are growing well, and last year, we comfortably exceeded our plan to generate turnover in excess of PS150m - delivering sales of almost PS180m. Start-up costs and initial operating losses on Direct were PS25m, up on last year and we expect these to reduce this year to around PS20m. Homeplus We are extending the trial of our general merchandise-only stores to a further ten large sites, including our new store at Cribbs Causeway, Bristol, which will open this summer, selling some Tesco Direct products from stock. Dobbies The acquisition of a majority share in Dobbies Garden Centres PLC was completed at the end of the first half and with our 65.5% ownership of the business we are now implementing the strategy we outlined for the business at the time the offer was announced. Dobbies is a strong business, already a leading innovator in its market and with Tesco's resources, it will be able to expand more rapidly towards national coverage. It will also become a platform for the group to encourage green consumption - by developing an offer for customers who are looking for sustainable solutions - from water recycling, to wind and solar power. In April 2008, Dobbies announced an open offer of new shares to raise PS150m of additional capital to fund expansion. Retailing services operations Our efforts to bring simplicity and value to sometimes complicated markets are behind the success of our retailing services businesses. Underpinning our services strategy is a strong economic model, based around leveraging existing assets - either our own or a partner's - so that we can simultaneously price our services competitively for customers and also achieve high returns for shareholders. com annualreport08 Business Review continued 212584 TESCO REP P1 17 1 5 08 19:34 Page 12 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 13 Tesco Personal Finance TPF TPF is ten years old this year and 2007 8 was a successful one for our joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland - with 1.7m new customers being attracted by a substantial increase in its range to 26 products, spanning credit cards to pet insurance and bureaux fide change. New products were launched in health insurance, dental insurance and internet savings accounts. Most products are available online, where over 50% of new sales are now made, after a 20% rise in internet business in the year. The Tesco Compare website, which allows customers to compare price and non-price product features across a wide range of providers, has been very successful. Whilst profits were flat in the year, this was after absorbing PS31m of additional home insurance claims linked to last summer's severe floods in Yorkshire and the Thames and Severn valleys. com had another excellent year, with our online businesses achieving a 31% increase in sales to PS1.6bn and a 49% increase in profit to PS124m before initial operating losses on Tesco Direct, helped by improved order picking productivity. Customer numbers once again saw strong growth - we saw 20% growth in new customers during the year leaving more than one million active customers by the year end. Product availability has improved again, with more customers receiving everything they order, and this has been helped by the strong growth in bag-less delivery to customers, which was launched only in the first half but which now represents 40% of all orders. We have also seen an improvement in delivery slot availability of more than 10% and our Croydon dotcom-only store is now profitable and handling orders with a value of over PS1m per week. T esco T elecoms Our telecoms business made very good progress, with promising growth in sales across our mobile, home phone and branded phone operations. Tesco Mobile, our joint venture with O2, moved from a small loss in 2006 7 to an encouraging level of profitability - in its fifth year of operation. Sales were up 39% mainly as a result of strong growth in its customer base, which grew by a quarter of a million during the year: the second highest net subscriber increase in its market. Mobile also remained the best service for overall customer satisfaction throughout 2007. Hardware sales, including handsets, grew well in the year, driving over 35% growth in our branded telecoms hardware business. Resources and relationships Customers Our customers have told us what they want from an 'Every little helps' shopping trip and this year 300,000 shared their ideas on how to improve the shopping trip for all customers, including those who attended our in-store Customer Question Time sessions. Clubcard also helps us to understand what our customers want, whilst allowing us to thank them for shopping with us - this year we gave away over PS380m in Clubcard vouchers. In the next year we plan to launch versions of Clubcard in Thailand, Hungary, Turkey, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. We don't always get it right but we try to make our customers' shopping trip as easy as possible, reduce prices where we can to help them spend less and give them the convenience of shopping when and where they want - in small stores, large stores or online. Employees With over 440,000 staff in 13 countries, we play an important role in creating employment, fostering skills and generating economic development. Our people are our most important asset. Looking after our staff so that they can look after our customers is one of the core values of the business. We are committed to providing market-leading working conditions for our staff and we encourage our suppliers to do the same. In the UK, we offer our staff a market-leading package of pay and benefits: Employee share schemes Through share ownership and share incentive schemes, over 170,000 of our people have a personal stake in Tesco. Staff were awarded shares worth a record PS85m last May under our Shares in Success scheme. 52,000 staff were able to benefit when Save As You Earn schemes matured in February, giving them access to shares worth PS175m. Training and development We are committed to developing our people to bring out the best in everyone and do what we can to enable all our people to reach their potential. All our staff have access to training programmes and personal development planning to ensure that they have the right skills to do their job. Diversity and inclusivity We strive to provide an inclusive environment where all difference is valued, people are able to be themselves, enjoy coming to work and realise their full potential, regardless of their gender, marital status, race, age, sexual preference and orientation, colour, creed, ethnic origin, religion or belief, or disability. Suppliers To be a successful, sustainable business we have to ensure that our drive to bring cheaper prices is achieved without compromising our standards, reducing quality, damaging the environment or harming the suppliers and workers who produce the goods we sell. So we take a partnership approach to working with suppliers - sharing our knowledge and listening to suppliers' feedback. This includes providing technical expertise, advice and insight into customer trends and making regular payments, on time. We are one of four signatories to the UK Government's statutory Supermarkets Code of Practice. Since the Code's introduction we have run tailored training for all Tesco buyers to promote understanding and compliance. If problems do arise in supplier relationships we aim to air and resolve them through constructive discussion. T o aid this process, three years ago we appointed a Code Compliance Officer to hear formal complaints, confidentially if requested, and we hope that our annual Supplier Viewpoint Survey encourages suppliers to give us more feedback on our relationships. Our target is for feedback to show that at least 90% of our UK suppliers view Tesco as being trustworthy, reliable, consistent, clear, helpful and fair. We carry out ethical audits and target ourselves to cover 100% of our high risk own brand suppliers and ensure all commercial teams have received training on supply chain labour standards. This year we carried out significantly more audits than the previous year - 455 compared to 221. However the number of sites to be audited also increased significantly to 623 and were disproportionately allocated a high risk rating as the business continues to expand into non-food areas. The introduction of the Sedex risk assessment tool in September 2007 also had an impact as a proportion of medium risk suppliers were reclassified as high risk. As these changes did not occur until late in the financial year and resources had already been allocated to improving our auditing programme, we failed to meet our target. To help us meet our target in future years, we have increased the resource in our ethical trading team to cope with the higher number of suppliers as our business grows. Community, environment and corporate responsibility People tell us they want us to use our size and reach to be a force for good in society. To help us meet this challenge we decided in 2006 to introduce a new Community Plan. This is part of our Steering Wheel, setting out objectives that the business will deliver. It will ensure we provide the right resources, energy and focus to meet the expectations of our customers and other stakeholders in this area. 212584 TESCO REP P1 17 1 5 08 19:34 Page 13 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 14 We have made significant progress this year on the Community Plan and on our key objectives of being a good neighbour in the communities we serve and being fair, responsible and honest, particularly on the environment. This has been recognised through our continued inclusion in FTSE4Good and Dow Jones Sustainability indices. Environment We have made strides towards a revolution in green consumption - incentivising the environmental option and making it affordable. Through our unique Green Clubcard scheme, we have reduced carrier bag use by over one billion, more than any other retailer, and we are on track to save an extra billion bags in the next year. We are also on target to sell ten million energy-efficient lightbulbs in a year as part of the Climate Group's 'Together' campaign. We have halved our energy use per square foot since 2000, two years ahead of target. In the UK, the carbon intensity of our new stores opened after 1 March 2006 has been reduced by 22% since last year. Partly through innovations like transporting wine by canal, we have cut our UK CO2 emissions per case delivered by over 10% over the past year. We have invested PS25m to create a Sustainable Consumption Institute at Manchester University. Bringing together world-leading experts from various disciplines, the Institute will help lead the way to a low-carbon economy. We opened our fourth UK environmental store in Shrewsbury in 2007, and have now built environmental stores in six countries outside the UK. Our Shrewsbury store has a carbon footprint 60% lower than a standard store of a comparable size. It makes use of more natural light, recycled and re-useable materials and the UK's first fleet of battery-powered home delivery vans. We have also invested significantly in energy-saving technology in China, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Slovakia, South Korea, Turkey, Thailand and the US. Nutrition We continued our roll-out of front-of-pack GDA nutritional labelling across the group including Turkey, South Korea and Poland, where 33% of our products are now labelled, and Ireland, which now includes over 5,000 labelled food items. Customers tell us they find these labels very helpful in making informed choices. In the UK, we are still the only supermarket where all relevant products carry the labels - over 7,000 in total - with a further 13,000 now also carried on manufacturer-branded goods. Community Our staff achieved our most successful 'Charity of the Year' ever, raising PS4.4m for the British Red Cross. As well as donating PS100,000 to the British Red Cross flood appeal last summer, our staff provided essential hygiene, food items and much of the bottled water for affected communities in key parts of the South-West. We have opened five new regional buying offices in England, joining the existing offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We introduced 1,000 new local lines last year taking the total to over 3,000. We now sell 200,000 litres of 'localchoice' milk each week in the UK, helping customers to support small dairy farmers in their local area. We have helped 1.5m people to get active this year, including through Cancer Research UK's Race for Life, which saw 665,000 people taking part in 5km runs, including over 21,000 Tesco staff. We launched a new partnership with the Football Association FA as part of our plan to help two million people get active in the run up to the London 2012 Olympics. The FA Tesco Skills Programme supports grassroots football, inspiring children between ages 5 and 11 to get active in their local communities. We have already delivered football coaching to over 250,000 children. We also continue to make a difference locally through our Computers for Schools programme which now offers 'eco-quiet' PCs as part of a catalogue of over 700 products. Since the start of the scheme 16 years ago we have given away over PS118m worth of equipment. Through new store openings and refits in China we have sponsored more than 7,000 disadvantaged students to cover their schooling and textbooks. In Poland, half the schools 15,000 took part in their sixth year of Tesco for Schools, whilst in Hungary, we set up local partnerships with schools and colleges, donating around PS50,000 and contributing recycled computers. This year, we have launched Community Plans in eight countries bringing together a range of community, environmental and health projects, tailored to local market needs and the remaining three will be starting soon. A number of our more mature markets now have comprehensive community and environment programmes. In South Korea, for example, we have 50 culture centres in our stores which offer up to 350 different educational and cultural programmes ranging from dance to cookery classes. The year ahead We will take the reduction of single-use carrier bags to the next level, achieving a 50% reduction compared to 2006 by continuing to focus on incentives rather than penalties. We will launch the first phase of our trial for carbon labelling our products in the coming weeks, in conjunction with the Carbon Trust, and will help customers become familiar with the new currency of CO2. We will appoint Community Champions to 50 stores. These members of staff are dedicated to making sure that our stores reach out to more people in local communities. We will support our new Charity of the Year, Marie Curie Cancer Care, to fund an additional 125,000 hours of nursing care for terminally ill patients. We will build the largest privately-funded solar facility in the Czech Republic at our Postrizin distribution centre. Alcohol Earlier this year we made an offer to government that we would play a positive part in any discussions initiated by them on measures to ensure a responsible approach to alcohol pricing and promotions. Competition law prevents the industry from taking this forward in collaboration. We maintain this offer and have in the meantime reinforced our responsible 'Think 21' approach by giving staff further dedicated training on responsible alcohol sales, with a particular focus on the social and health impacts of under-age drinking. We are also talking to customers about the role we can play in tackling problem drinking and how we can better help them make responsible choices. Risks and uncertainties Introduction Risk is an accepted part of doing business. The real challenge for any business is to identify the principal risks it faces and to develop and monitor appropriate controls. A successful risk management process balances risks and rewards and relies on a sound judgement of their likelihood and consequence. The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and internal control within the context of achieving the Group's objectives. Our process for identifying and managing risks is set out in more detail from page 22 of the Corporate Governance section of this Annual Report and Financial Statements. The key risks faced by the Group and relevant mitigating factors are set out below. Business strategy If our strategy follows the wrong direction or is not effectively communicated then the business may suffer. We need to understand and properly manage strategic risk in order to deliver long-term growth for the benefit of all our stakeholders. Our strategy is based on five elements: to grow the core UK business, be as strong in non-food as in food, develop retailing services, become a successful international retailer www. com annualreport08 Business Review continued 212584 TESCO REP P1 17 1 5 08 19:34 Page 14 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 15 and put the community at the heart of what we do. Pursuit of this five-part strategy has allowed the business to diversify and, at a strategic level, diversification and pursuit of growth in emerging markets have the effect of reducing overall risk by avoiding reliance on a small number of business areas. However, by its very nature, diversification also introduces new risks to be managed in areas of the business that are less mature and less fully understood. To ensure the Group continues to pursue the right strategy, the Board discusses strategic issues at every Board meeting, and dedicates two full days a year to reviewing the Group's strategy. The Executive Committee also holds specific sessions to discuss strategy on a regular basis. We have structured programmes for engaging with all our stakeholders including customers, employees, investors, suppliers, government, media and non-governmental organisations. We also invest significant resources in ensuring our strategy is communicated well and understood by the parties who are key to delivering it. The business operates a Steering Wheel - a balanced scorecard process whereby we set goals for different areas of the business and assess our overall progress on a quarterly basis - in all countries and significant business units such as Dotcom to help manage performance and deliver business strategy. Financial strategy and Group treasury risk The main financial risks of the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. The Treasury function is mandated by the Board to manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs. The function has clear policies and operating parameters, and its activities are routinely reviewed and audited. The function does not operate as a profit centre and the undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted. A description of the role of the Finance Committee and Internal and External Audit is set out in the Corporate Governance section on page 23. Operational threats and performance risk in the business There is a risk that our business may not deliver the stated strategy in full, particularly since, like all retailers, the business is susceptible to economic downturn that could affect consumer spending. The continuing acquisition and development of property sites also forms an intrinsic part of our strategy and this carries inherent risks. We try to deliver what customers want better than our competitors by understanding and responding to their behaviour. All of our business units have stretching targets based on the Steering Wheel and the performance of business units is monitored continually and reported regularly to the Board. We manage the acquisition and development of our property assets carefully. We consider and assess in detail every site at each stage of acquisition and development and ensure that relevant action is taken to minimise any risks. Our aim is to have broad appeal to all customers in our different markets, minimising the impact of changes to the economic climate. Competition and consolidation The retail industry is highly competitive. The Group competes with a wide variety of retailers of varying sizes and faces increased competition from UK retailers as well as international operators in the UK and overseas. Failure to compete with competitors on areas including price, product range, quality and service could have an adverse effect on the Group's financial results. We aim to have a broad appeal in price, range and store format in a way that allows us to compete in different markets. We track performance against a range of measures that customers tell us are critical to their shopping trip experience and we constantly monitor customer perceptions of ourselves and our competitors to ensure we can respond quickly if we need to. People capabilities Our greatest asset is our employees. It is critical to our success to attract, retain, develop and motivate the best people with the right capabilities at all levels of operations. We review our people policies regularly and are committed to investing in training and development and incentives for our people. Our 'Talent Planning' process helps individuals achieve their full potential. We also carry out succession planning to ensure that the needs of the business going forward are considered and provided for. There are clear processes for understanding and responding to employees' needs through our People Matters Group, staff surveys, regular performance reviews, involvement of trade unions in relevant markets and regular communication of business developments. Reputational risk As the largest retailer in the UK, expectations of the Group are high. Failure to protect the Group's reputation and brand could lead to a loss of trust and confidence. This could result in a decline in the customer base and affect the ability to recruit and retain good people. Like other companies we must consider potential threats to our reputation and the consequences of reputational damage. Emotional loyalty to the Tesco brand has helped us diversify into new areas like retail services and non-food and we recognise the commercial imperative to do the right thing for all our stakeholders and avoid the loss of such loyalty. The 'Tesco Values' are embedded in the way we do business at every level and our Code of Ethics guides our behaviour in our dealings with customers, employees and suppliers. We engage with stakeholders in every sphere to take into account their views and we try to ensure our strategy reflects them. The launch of the Community Plan in 2006 has demonstrated our commitment to tackling a wide range of societal and environmental issues. We have high level committees, including the Executive Committee, Corporate Responsibility Committee and Compliance Committee, to help guide and monitor our policies. Environmental risks Our key environmental risks are related to minimising energy usage in stores and transportation, waste management and our ability to respond to consumer concerns in this area. We develop environmental policy through engaging with key stakeholders and experts in this field to achieve sustainable growth and minimise our environmental impacts. The Group's approach is brought together in a consistent manner by the Executive Committee. Policy is reviewed regularly by the Executive Committee, Compliance Committee and Corporate Responsibility Committee. We recognise the opportunities for competitive advantage through energy efficiency and look for continuous improvement through innovations and better ways to help customers act responsibly towards the environment. Product safety The safety and quality of our products is of paramount importance to Tesco as well as being essential for maintaining customer trust and confidence. A breach in confidence could affect the size of our customer base and hence financial results. We have detailed and established procedures for ensuring product integrity at all times, especially for our own-label products. There are strict product safety processes and regular management reports. We work in partnership with suppliers to ensure mutual understanding of the standards required. We also monitor developments in areas such as health, safety and nutrition in order to respond appropriately to changing customer trends and new legislation. We have clear processes for crisis management, pulling together expert teams should we need to respond quickly on issues. 212584 TESCO REP P1 17 1 5 08 19:34 Page 15 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 16 Health and safety risks While the safety of our staff and customers is of the utmost importance to us, if we are unable to provide safe environments for our staff and customers this could lead to injuries or loss of life. We operate stringent health and safety processes in line with best practice in our stores, distribution centres and offices, which are monitored and audited regularly. KPIs for preventing health and safety incidents form an intrinsic part of our Steering Wheels across the business, and performance against these KPIs is reported quarterly. Our Group Compliance Committee and the compliance committees in our international businesses monitor the level of compliance with health and safety laws and our internal policies on a regular basis. Ethical risks in the supply chain More than 1.8 million people in over 90 countries work for direct suppliers to Tesco and the supply chain is made of complex relationships - from individual farmers and growers through to processors, manufacturers and distributors. At the heart of our values is our belief that we should treat people as we like to be treated and we have a responsibility to help workers in our supply chain enjoy fair labour standards. We therefore require our suppliers to meet strict criteria on labour standards, and as a founder member of the Ethical Trading Initiative ETI we expect all our suppliers to follow the ETI base code and guarantee their workers the rights set out within it. There is, however, a risk that any part of the supply chain might not adhere to these high standards. To minimise this risk we only work with suppliers who can demonstrate that they are committed to the ETI code and share our values. We use Supplier Ethical Data Exchange SEDEX to carry out risk assessment of all our direct suppliers and all medium and high-risk suppliers must undergo an extensive, independent ethical audit. We have in the last year introduced a comprehensive programme of audit improvements, including more unannounced audits, a new Trading Fairly strategy and an industry-leading Auditor Recognition programme, which involves our use only of individual auditors who have been assessed for competence. We have also sought to involve more multi-stakeholder representatives on our audits to improve workforce engagement and enable activists to see and feedback on our approach. We work with suppliers to identify any problems and, where they exist, support them in taking action to improve standards for their workers. We have also invested heavily in building the labour standards capabilities of our suppliers and our own commercial teams in the last year, including rolling out extensive training, to help them identify and avoid issues before they arise. We also work with businesses, governments, Non-governmental organisations NGOs and others to tackle complex and systemic problems that we cannot solve on our own. As well as having a key role in the ETI we also work closely with the Global Social Compliance Programme and other groups in specific industries or regions, including the Wine and Agriculture Ethical Trade Association in South Africa and the Environmental Justice Foundation in Uzbekistan. Fraud and compliance As the business grows in size and geographical spread, the risk of occurrence of fraudulent behaviour by our employees increases. Whilst the vast majority of our staff are completely honest, there remains the potential for fraud and other dishonest activity at all levels of the business from the shop floor to senior management. The Group takes extensive steps to reduce this risk. Relevant accounting and other procedures and controls at all levels are clearly set out and audited across the business to reduce the risk of fraud. The Group gives clear guidance on behaviour to employees through the Tesco Values and the Code of Ethics. Internal Audit undertakes detailed investigations into all areas of the business and highlights its findings to the Audit Committee. The Compliance Committee formulates and monitors the implementation of, and compliance with appropriate policies on key areas of ethical behaviour, including fraud. Property We have stretching targets for delivering new space in the UK and overseas, and may face challenges in finding suitable sites and obtaining planning or other consents to enable sites to be acquired and developed. The complexity of many of our property developments is increasing, especially the growing number of mixed-use schemes. We also have to comply with design and construction standards which vary significantly from country to country. Our Property Acquisition Committees and other related committees in the UK, Europe, Asia and the US closely control all aspects of the property acquisition, planning and construction processes, to ensure that applicable standards are met and financial risks are minimised. Our Group and country compliance committees also monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in all aspects of our property activities. Non-food risks As the proportion of our business represented by non-food products increases, there is a risk that a downturn in consumer confidence may affect the level of demand for products which consumers may regard as non-essential. We make every effort to ensure that our non-food products are competitively priced to offer a broad range of products ranging from value to the luxury end of the market, in order to cater for the needs of as wide a range of customers as possible. IT systems and infrastructure The business is dependent on efficient information technology IT systems. Any significant failure in the IT processes of our retail operations e. g. barcode scanning or supply chain logistics would impact our ability to trade. We recognise the essential role that IT plays across our operations in allowing us to trade efficiently and so that we can achieve commercial advantage through implementing IT innovations that improve the shopping trip for customers and make life easier for employees. We have extensive controls in place to maintain the integrity and efficiency of our IT infrastructure and we share systems from across our international operations to ensure consistency of delivery. Regulatory and political environment We are subject to a wide variety of regulations in the different countries in which we operate because of the diverse nature of our business. Tesco may be impacted by regulatory changes in key areas such as planning laws, trading hours, and tax rules as well as by scrutiny by the competition authorities, who have been carrying out enquiries in the UK, Ireland and elsewhere. We may also be impacted by political developments in the countries in which we operate. We consider these uncertainties in the external environment when developing strategy and reviewing performance. We remain vigilant to future changes. As part of our day-to-day operations we engage with governmental and nongovernmental organisations to ensure the views of our customers and employees are represented and try to anticipate and contribute to important changes in public policy wherever we operate. Activism and terrorism A major incident or terrorist event incapacitating management, systems or stores could impact on the Group's ability to trade. In addition to contingency plans, we have security systems and processes that reflect best practice. Pension risks The Group's pension arrangements are an important part of our employees' overall benefits package especially in the UK. We see them as a strong contributor to our ability to attract and retain good people, our Group's greatest asset. Since the implementation of IAS 19 there is a risk that the accounting valuation deficit which is recorded as a liability on the Group Balance Sheet could increase if returns on corporate bonds are higher than the investment return on the pension scheme's assets. The Group has considered its pension risks and has taken action by reducing risk in its investment strategy. com annualreport08 Business Review continued 212584 TESCO REP P1 17 1 5 08 19:34 Page 16 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 17 Joint venture governance and partnerships As we continue to enter into new partnerships and joint ventures as well as developing existing arrangements, there remains an inherent risk in managing these partnerships and joint ventures. It is more difficult to guarantee the achievement of joint goals that affect our partners and we rely on partners to help achieve such goals. We may also be impacted by reputational issues which affect our partners. We choose partners with good reputations and set out joint goals and clear contractual arrangements from the outset. We monitor performance and governance of our joint ventures and partnerships. Financial review The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. These risks are managed as described below. The Group Balance Sheet position at 23 February 2008 is representative of the position throughout the year. Funding and liquidity The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, long and medium-term debt, capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases. The objective is to ensure continuity of funding. The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities, and a strong credit rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. The Group's long-term credit rating remained stable during the year. Tesco Group is rated A1 by Moody's and A by Standard and Poor's. New funding of PS3.0bn was arranged during the year, including a net PS0.9bn from property transactions, PS1.1bn from an issue of US denominated senior notes and PS1.0bn from medium-term notes MTNs. At the year end, net debt was PS6.2bn last year PS4.9bn. Interest rate risk management The objective is to limit our exposure to increases in interest rates while retaining the opportunity to benefit from interest rate reductions. Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and collars are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. The policy is to fix or cap a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs. At the year end, PS2.5bn of debt was in fixed rate form last year PS2.3bn with a further PS0.9bn of debt capped or collared, therefore 55% 2007 - 67% of net debt is fixed, capped or collared. The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate form. The average rate of interest paid on a historic cost basis excluding joint ventures and associates this year was 4.5% last year 4.8%. Foreign currency risk management Our principal objective is to reduce the effect of exchange rate volatility on short-term profits. Transactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are hedged, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies and currency options. At the year end, forward foreign currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to PS1,198m were outstanding 2007 - PS764m as detailed in note 20. We hedge the majority of our investments in our international subsidiaries via foreign exchange transactions in matching currencies. Our objective is to maintain a low cost of borrowing and hedge against material movements in our Group Balance Sheet value. During the year, currency movements increased the net value of the Group's overseas assets by PS284m last year increase of PS77m. We translate overseas profits at average foreign exchange rates which we do not currently seek to hedge. Credit risk The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions across an approved list of counterparties of high credit quality. The Group's positions with these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored. Tesco Personal Finance TPF TPF lending is predominantly to individuals through its credit card and unsecured personal loan products. TPF has also developed a significant insurance business, with motor insurance a major component. TPF risk is managed by observing and adopting industry best practices and drawing upon the expertise and systems of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, including its subsidiary Direct Line. All policies pertaining to risk within TPF are subject to the governance procedures of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group and ratified by the TPF Board, which has representation from both Tesco and the Royal Bank of Scotland Group. This has delivered a portfolio of products with strong asset quality. This asset quality is maintained through proactive risk management, both at the time of acquisition and ongoing account maintenance. The Tesco Group would support its 50% share of any further funding TPF might require to sustain liquidity ratios. However, we believe that provisions for bad debts and insurance losses supported by re-insurance of significant risks are at prudent levels. Insurance We purchased Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability protection from the open insurance market at 'catastrophe' level only. The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the business by using our captive insurance companies, Tesco Insurance Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the Republic of Ireland. Tesco Insurance Limited covers Assets and Earnings, while Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability.

It also explains other aspects of the Group's results and operations, including strategy and risk management. Long-term strategy Tesco has a well-established and consistent strategy for growth, which has allowed us to strengthen our core UK business and drive expansion into new markets. Our four part strategy to diversify the business was laid down in 1997 and has been the foundation of Tesco's success in recent years. The new businesses which have been created and developed over the last decade as part of this strategy now have scale, they are competitive and profitable - in fact, they make more profit than the entire Group did in 1997. The objectives of the strategy are: to grow the core UK business: to become a successful international retailer: to be as strong in non-food as in food: and to develop retailing services - such as Tesco Personal Finance, Telecoms and tesco. In 2006 07, Tesco has again delivered a strong performance, with all four parts of the strategy contributing. We have sustained good growth in the UK and coped well with the challenges of recovering competitors, rising costs and a cautious consumer background. In our international operations we have also made good progress, completing our largest ever programme of new store openings and weathered difficult conditions in some of our largest markets. In non-food, more customers are choosing to shop with us even in a period of more cautious consumer spending and we have launched Tesco Direct, which extends our reach in selling a broad range of products on the internet and via catalogue. Finally, our retailing services have delivered another good year, with tesco. com sustaining its rapid growth, Tesco Personal Finance making progress in challenging markets and Telecoms continuing to build its customer base strongly.

Trading Profit is an adjusted measure of operating profit excluding property-related items and replaces the IAS 19 income statement charge with 'normal' cash contributions for pensions. Trading Margin is calculated using sales excluding value added tax. o Results for the year ended 25 February 2006 include 52 weeks for the UK and the Republic of Ireland and 14 months for the majority of the remaining International businesses. com corporate Group performance These results represent very good progress across the Group and have been achieved by investing to improve the shopping experience for customers in our businesses around the world. We have been able to deliver another solid sales performance, and through good cost control and productivity improvements we have grown profits faster than revenue - and thereby improved returns for shareholders. These improvements have been achieved whilst continuing to invest in the long term - in the people, assets, processes and systems, which will enable T esco to sustain its success in the future. Group These results are for the 52 weeks ended 24 February 2007, compared with the equivalent 52-week period for the UK and the Republic of Ireland combined with the 60-week period to the end of February 2006 for the majority of the international businesses. Where appropriate, and for ease of comparison, total Group and segmental results are also reported against a comparable 52-week period to 25 February 2006. Group sales, including VAT, increased by 8.1% to PS46.6bn last year PS43.1bn and by 10.9% on a comparable 52-week basis. At constant exchange rates, sales increased by 7.9% and 10.8% respectively. Last April, with our Preliminary Results for 2005 06, and following our transition to IFRS, we introduced an underlying profit measure, which excludes the impact of the volatile noncash elements of IAS 19, IAS 32 and IAS 39 principally pension costs and the marking to market of financial instruments. Underlying profit rose to PS2,545m in the year, an increase of 13.2% on a comparable 52-week basis. This includes, as usual, property profits but excludes both the gain in the year from the Finance Act 2006 pensions adjustment Pensions A-Day and the impairment charge on our Gerrards Cross site. With our Interim Results for 2006 07, we also began reporting segmental trading profit, which excludes property profits and, as our underlying profit measure does, also excludes the non-cash element of the IAS 19 pension charge. In the current year this measure also excludes the Pensions A-Day gain and the impairment charge on Gerrards Cross. Group trading profits were PS2,478m, up 11.1% on last year on a comparable basis. Group operating profit rose by 17.7% to PS2,648m. Total net Group property profits were PS139m, comprising PS98m in the UK, a PS6m loss in Asia and a PS47m profit within Joint Ventures and Associates.

Start-up costs totalling PS42m for Tesco Direct and establishing our operations in the United States were charged to the UK. Although the combined start-up losses were a little below our previous guidance of PS50m, we expect these to increase during the current year, particularly in the US, as we recruit store and depot staff ahead of our planned launch later this year see page 12. Despite absorbing these additional costs, UK trading profit rose 9.2%, with trading margins at 5.9%, similar to last year. 2006 7 Growth UK sales inc. VAT PS35,580m 9.0% UK trading profit PS1,914m 9.2% Trading margin 5.9% - Joint Ventures and Associates Our share of profit net of tax and interest for the year was PS106m compared to PS82m last year. Tesco Personal Finance TPF profit was PS130m, of which our share was PS65m, down on last year after absorbing higher provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Profits from property joint ventures rose significantly, due to the sale of two stores in which we remain tenants to third parties, realising PS47m of property profits from two of our joint venture companies during the year. In September, we sold our 38.5% equity stake in GroceryWorks, an internet grocery retailing business in the United States US, to Safeway Inc. which resulted in a profit of PS22m. Exceptional items Pensions adjustment Pensions A-Day : In April 2006, a Finance Act revision was agreed. This change, known as Pensions A-Day, enabled members of our UK defined benefit scheme to gain additional pension flexibility, altering our pension scheme assumptions and resulting in a reduction of the future liability by PS250 million pre-tax. Changes in pension assumptions for the Republic of Ireland pension scheme produced a smaller gain of PS8m, bringing the total exceptional gain to PS258m, recognised in the Income Statement. Gerrards Cross: we are facing continuing uncertainty in respect of our Gerrards Cross site as a result of the complex legal situation following the tunnel collapse. No decision has yet been taken about the future for this site. However, at year end we have written off the carrying value of our existing asset there an impairment charge of PS35m. We are not yet in a position to assess any recoveries or liabilities in respect of ongoing claims. Finance costs and tax Net finance costs were PS126m last year PS127m, giving interest cover of 21 times last year 18 times. Total Group tax has been charged at an effective rate of 29.1% last year 29.0%. Underlying diluted earnings per share increased by 11.6% on a comparable basis, to 22.36p last year - 20.04p. Dividend The Board has proposed a final dividend of 6.83p per share last year 6.10p. This represents an increase of 12.0%. As announced with our Preliminary Results last year, we have now built dividend cover to comfortable levels and this increase in dividend is again in line with growth in underlying diluted earnings per share, which includes net property profits. We intend to continue to grow future dividends broadly in line with underlying diluted earnings per share growth. The final dividend will be paid on 6 July 2007 to shareholders on the Register of Members as at the close of business on 27 April 2007 the dividend record date. Shareholders now have the opportunity to elect to reinvest their cash dividend and purchase existing Tesco shares in the Company through a Dividend Reinvestment Plan. This scheme replaced the scrip dividend at the last Interim Results and was introduced to reduce dilution of issued shares and improve earnings per share. Cash flow and Balance Sheet Group capital expenditure excluding acquisitions rose as planned, to PS3.0bn during the year last year PS2.8bn. UK capital expenditure was PS1.9bn last year PS1.8bn, including PS687m on new stores and PS295m on extensions and refits. Total international capital expenditure rose slightly to PS1.1bn last year PS1.0bn : comprising PS0.4bn in Asia and PS0.7bn in Europe. The UK total includes PS89m of capital invested in establishing our operations in the United States. We expect US investment to move to around the PS250m level this year, in line with the guidance we issued when we announced our entry to the market last year. We expect Group capital expenditure this year to be around PS3.5bn. Cash flow from operating activities, including an improvement of PS11m within working capital, totalled PS3.5bn. Overall, the Group had a net cash outflow of PS265m during the year, leaving net borrowings of PS5.0bn at the year-end, PS0.5bn higher than last year. Return on capital employed In April last year, we renewed our commitment to increasing our post-tax return on capital employed ROCE, having exceeded our 2004 aspiration two years early. We set a new target to improve ROCE by a further 200 basis points. The strong performance of the business delivered slightly higher ROCE in 2006 07 - at 12.6% last year 12.5%, Including the one-off benefit from Pensions A-Day, ROCE was 13.6%. This represents good progress and was achieved despite carrying the extra start-up costs and investment in the US and Tesco Direct as well as the integration costs and capital employed in our International acquisitions and increased stake in Hymall. This means that ROCE is on track to meet our new target. 7 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW Total Shareholder Return Total shareholder return TSR, which is measured as the percentage increase in the share price, plus the dividend paid, has increased by 36% in 2006 07, its largest value increase for ten years - and the fastest percentage growth rate for three years. Over the last three years, TSR has grown 87% compared with the FTSE100 average of 58%. Over five years, the increase has been 102% compared to the increase in the average for FTSE100 companies of just 50%. Releasing value from property As announced last April, we plan to release cash from property through a sequence of joint ventures and other transactions, both in the UK and internationally and return significant value to shareholders, either through enhanced dividends through the growth in underlying earnings per share, which includes property profits or share buy-backs. The first of these deals, with the British Airways Pension Fund, which formed part of our plan to release some PS5bn of funds from property over five years, was completed during the second half. A second, larger joint venture transaction was completed with The British Land Company PLC after the year end. Combined, these two transactions involved the divestment to these joint ventures of some 5% of our UK store space. They realised PS1,015m in net proceeds and were completed at very attractive initial yields below 4.5%, whilst also delivering significant property profits from which dividends are paid to shareholders. The average premium to bookvalue on these transactions has been nearly 100%. Some of the proceeds have already been used to fund our share buy-back programme. Importantly, these joint ventures also provide us with the right platform to run our business for customers. The net bookvalue of our fixed assets is PS17bn - most of it in freehold stores - even after these divestments. We estimate current market value to be around 65% higher than this. Given the store of value embedded in our property and the strength of our covenant we have decided to divest more freehold property assets than the PS5bn we announced last April. This is consistent with our commitment to retain the strong asset-backing to our balance sheet and the freehold element of our property base will be maintained above 70%. At least PS1.5bn of our originally planned PS5bn of proceeds were to be used to buy Tesco shares in the market, initially to offset future dilution to earnings per share and almost PS470m has already been spent in this way. In light of our enlarged programme of property divestment, we now plan to return a total of at least PS3bn of the proceeds to shareholders. Pensions The provision of Tesco's award-winning UK defined benefit pension scheme for our staff remains an important priority. It goes to the heart of our values and helps us attract and retain the best people. We manage and fund our scheme on an actuarial valuation basis and, as at December 2006, the scheme was estimated to be fully funded, largely as a result of improved asset performance. IFRS requires that we value pension scheme liabilities using a high quality corporate bond yield and calculate the operating charge in the Income Statement as if invested purely in bonds. At February 2007, the IAS 19 pension deficit was just under PS670m on a post-tax basis, a significant reduction on last year, reflecting Pensions A-Day. The A-Day change enabled members of our UK defined benefit scheme to gain additional pension flexibility, altering our pension scheme assumptions and resulting in a reduction of the future liability by PS250m pre-tax see pensions adjustment on page 6. 8 T esco PLC Annual report and financial statements 2007 Find out more at www. com corporate Operating and financial review continued 2007 2006 Sales growth Change in Group sales over the year including value added tax 10.9% 13.2% UK sales growth 9.0% 10.7% International sales growth 17.9% 23.0% International sales growth at constant exchange rates 17.4% 15.5% Profit before tax PS2,653m PS2,206m Underlying profit before tax PS2,545m PS2,248m Trading margin UK trading margin 5.9% 5.8% International trading margin 5.7% 5.7% Trading margin is calculated from the operating profit expressed as a percentage of Group revenue sales excluding value added tax. It is a measure of profit generation from sales and is a comparable performance measure with other companies. This is how much we made from trade in our stores, taking account of the cost of the products sold, wages and salaries, expenses associated with running the stores, depots and head office, and the cost of depreciation of the assets used to generate the profits. Net cash outflow inflow PS 265 m PS165m Net cash inflow is the cash received less cash spent during the financial period, after financing activities. Capital expenditure PS3.0bn PS2.8bn This is the cash invested in purchasing fixed assets.

ROCE is a relative profit measurement that not only incorporates the funds shareholders have invested, but also funds invested by banks and other lenders, and therefore shows the productivity of the assets of the Group. Underlying diluted earnings per share 22.36p 20.04p Underlying diluted earnings per share is the calculation of profit after tax and minority interest divided by the diluted weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. It is the amount which could be paid out on each share if the Company decided to distribute all its profits as dividends instead of retaining some for future expansion. Including the one-off gain from Pensions A-Day, ROCE was 13.6%. Key Performance Indicators KPIs We operate a balanced scorecard approach to managing the business that is known internally within the Group as our Steering Wheel. This unites the Group's resources around our customers, people, operations, finance and the community. This enables the business to be operated and monitored on a balanced basis with due regard for all stakeholders. Some of the KPIs below are tracked through our Steering Wheel and others are tracked as a monitor of investor return. 9 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 2007 2006 Total shareholder return 36.0% 45.8% Total shareholder return is the notional return from a share and is measured as the percentage change in the share price, plus the dividend paid. This is measured over the last five years. Full year dividend per share 9.64p 8.63p The growth of the dividend per share from one period to the next is important to shareholders since this represents their actual cash return, and is usually paid twice a year. We monitor a wide range of KPIs, both financial and non-financial. Across the Group, KPIs are set locally, with oversight from the Executive Directors, to ensure they are tailored to drive the priorities of each business. Each business operates a Steering Wheel, our balanced scorecard. During the last year we have made good progress with rolling-out our Corporate Responsibility management system to our International operations. We report quarterly on social, ethical and environmental matters alongside their Customer, Operations, Finance and People KPIs. More detail on each country follows in the 'Operations, resources and relationships' section. The following are some KPIs for the UK and Group operations. 2007 2006 UK market share Grocery market share 21.0% 20.2% Non-food market share 8.0% 7.0% This is measured as the share of all spend by all shoppers through Taylor Nelson Sofres Superpanel Total Till Roll data. Supplier viewpoint measure 94% 94% We aim to monitor supplier relations through the Supplier Viewpoint Survey. The target is for over 90% of suppliers to view Tesco as being trustworthy, reliable, consistent, clear, helpful and fair. Employee retention 84% 83% This measure shows the percentage of employees who have stayed with the business for longer than one year. It is one measure that we use to monitor employee loyalty and satisfaction and we aim to exceed 80% retention of experienced staff. Energy consumption 12.5% 5.5% For 2006 07 our target was to reduce energy consumption by 12% 2005 06 - 5%. 10 T esco PLC Annual report and financial statements 2007 Find out more at www. com corporate Operating and financial review continued Operations, resources and relationships We have continued to make good progress with all four parts of our strategy: grow the core UK business become a successful international retailer be as strong in non-food as in food, and develop retailing services We have done this by keeping our focus on trying to improve what we do for customers. We try to make their shopping experience as easy as possible, lower prices where we can to help them spend less, give them more choice about how they shop - in small stores, large stores or on-line, and seek to bring simplicity and value to sometimes complicated markets. International Despite challenging economic conditions and political uncertainty in some of our markets, our international businesses delivered another good performance. Sales growth has been strong - with like-for-like growth in all but one of our markets Hungary being the exception and profits have again moved ahead well. Margins continue to improve, despite absorbing significant integration costs from the in-market acquisitions we have completed in the year - in the Czech Republic, Poland and Malaysia. We are building-out our store networks more rapidly in existing markets - through a combination of strong organic growth and acquisitions. 484 stores, with 8.2m sq ft of selling area, were opened during the year, including 76 hypermarkets. This is four times the amount of new space opened in the UK. In Rest of Europe we opened over 4.7m sq ft of space and in Asia 3.5m sq ft. These numbers included the acquisition of: 11 Carrefour stores in the Czech Republic in May 2006 as part of the asset swap deal announced in September 2005, plus 27 small stores from Edeka in April, which together added 1.2m sq ft - or 45% to our space there. 146 Leader Price stores in Poland in December, which added a total of 1.4m sq ft - the equivalent of 29% of the existing sales area. Eight large Makro stores in Malaysia in January, which added 0.9m sq ft of sales area, nearly doubling our space in the market. We are keen to participate further in the process of consolidation which is now taking place in many International markets but we are selective purchasers of assets or businesses. At the end of February, our international operations were trading from 1,275 stores, including 411 hypermarkets, with a total of 40.4m sq ft of selling space. Nearly 60% of Group sales area is now in International. Excluding the United States, we expect to open 442 new stores in our International markets during the current year, adding 7.6m sq ft of selling area. Returns - CROI All our established markets are now profitable and with growing local scale, increasing store maturity and the benefits of investment in central distribution now flowing, returns from our International operations are continuing to rise. On a constant currency basis, cash return on investment CROI for International has increased again - to 11.5% with our lead markets overall maintaining significantly higher levels. Asia In China we trade from 47 hypermarkets, mainly in Shanghai, and the first stores in China's other large regional markets - Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Beijing our first Tesco-fascia store have opened well. Our new range of over 1,000 Tesco own brand lines have been well-received by customers. Hymall's sales have continued to grow strongly - up overall by 19% in the year, with strengthening like-for-like sales as the year progressed. As a result of carrying higher overheads as we invest to equip the business to grow faster, it made a small loss after tax and interest, of which our share was PS6m. In a still subdued retail market in Japan we made progress, with modest overall sales growth and a stronger like-for-like performance. Our focus in the year has been on refining and developing the trial Express-type stores into a profitable, expandable format and implementing our 'Tesco in a Box' suite of operating systems successfully. We now plan to push on with a much larger opening programme of up to 35 new stores this year. In Korea, Homeplus continued to do well, with solid sales and very strong profit growth in more challenging market conditions than in recent years. During the year we opened 29 new stores and, including extensions, almost 1m sq ft of space. Most of our new selling area came from large hypermarkets, but our development programme is now broadly-based with nearly 20% coming from store extensions, 21% from compact hypermarkets and the remainder from the roll-out of our successful Express convenience format, which now has almost 40 stores trading. We have a strong forward pipeline of new space, including plans to double the size of the Express business. Cash return on investment CROI is measured as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, expressed as a percentage of net invested capital. 11 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW Tesco Malaysia has made excellent progress, moving strongly through to profitability in the year, delivering another year of very strong over 50% sales growth, and achieving a near-doubling of space helped by the Makro acquisition, which completed in January. Substantial refits to the Makro stores have now begun, taking eight to nine weeks per store to complete and involving significant changes to layouts and ranges. We are developing a good market position in Malaysia with a strong new store programme in place for this year which will add a further 22% of space to our network. Political uncertainty in Thailand during the second half of the year produced a difficult business climate. Nevertheless, Tesco Lotus, which has a strong market position, again performed well, delivering good growth in sales and profit. The successful development and roll-out of new small formats continues and to date, we have 370 stores trading across four formats, including 75 hypermarkets of which 17 are Value stores. We also have 266 Express stores and 29 supermarkets which are proving very popular with customers. Europe Our rate of expansion in European markets stepped up significantly in the year with 4.7m sq ft of new space added - representing almost 30% growth. Successful regional initiatives to strengthen our business - from pan-European purchasing of own brand products and fresh produce to the introduction of the Cherokee clothing range - have contributed to further improvements in our competitiveness. Customer numbers are up significantly and this is driving substantial market share gains. In the Czech Republic, our business has grown by almost two-thirds in the year and is now one of the leaders in the market. We again delivered strong profit growth despite competitive market conditions and the challenges of integrating the Carrefour and Edeka acquisitions. Conversion of the 11 Carrefour stores is almost complete, we have a strong organic store opening programme which will add some 13% to our space in the current year and we have begun remodelling our department stores - with the first, at Brno, performing well. We continued to make progress in Hungary but although overall sales grew, profit performance was below budget. The effects of Government austerity measures last August on an already difficult economic and retail environment have been severe. Consumer spending levels are significantly down, with non-food categories particularly affected. Despite these challenges we have a strong market position which we have continued to strengthen by lowering prices, expanding our store network and developing our infrastructure. We opened 14 new stores in 2006 07, including 10 hypermarkets, and we plan to add 15% to our total space in the current year. Against the background of an improving economy and a consolidating retail industry in Poland, we are making very good progress, with rising sales, profits and returns. Sales growth has continued to be strong, driven by sustained improvement in existing store performance and a growing contribution from new space. The development of our 1k around 10,000 sqft, 2k and 3k store formats as part of an enlarged opening programme is going well. The acquisition of the Leader Price stores from Casino, which was announced last July and completed in December has accelerated our 1k format expansion and contributed to a 37% overall space increase in Poland. Leader Price stores are being converted rapidly to Tesco with, on average, 25% sales uplifts. Tesco Ireland delivered another excellent performance with improved profits and another year of strong sales growth in existing stores. Our new store opening programme will be substantially bigger this year - with 240,000 sq ft, representing growth of over 10%. The new 740,000 sq ft distribution centre at Donabate, in north Dublin, opens this month. Our competitive position is also strong and we're investing more for customers - for example, our largest ever programme of price cuts in Ireland, which started last spring, has been well-received. In Slovakia the success of our compact hypermarket format and a strong economy have underpinned pleasing growth in sales, profits and returns. We now have 25 such stores, representing approaching half of our total space, with more planned. We introduced our 1k format this year - opening the first store at Vrable and we now have six trading with nine more planned this year. Our organic expansion will add around 15% to our space this year. Operating and financial review continued 12 T esco PLC Annual report and financial statements 2007 Find out more at www. com corporate Our Kipa business in Turkey, continues to grow strongly and profitably and now has the capability and resources to become a national business. We now have 15 hypermarkets trading, with the majority now outside our base in Izmir, including our first store in Thrace, with 24 more planned for the current year. The early introduction of Express in Turkey has also gone well, with 15 stores now trading, including three in Antalya. We have invested in creating the infrastructure for a business of scale - initially in management and systems - and also in supply chain, with our first major distribution centre at Yasibasi covering 400,000 sq ft, planned to open this month. United States We are on track to open our first stores - under the Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Market banner - on the west coast of the United States, as planned, later this year. Our El Segundo office is now staffed by over 150 people and the construction of our Riverside distribution centre on the eastern edge of Los Angeles LA is on schedule. Site acquisition for our 10,000 square foot convenience format stores is also going well and we expect to be able to open a significant number at launch across the LA, Phoenix, Las Vegas and San Diego markets. Recruitment and training of staff for the stores will begin soon which, combined with the other pre-launch costs and initial trading losses, will involve a planned rise in estimated US start-up costs to around PS65m in the current financial year. Thereafter, as previously announced, we expect initial trading losses to diminish and the business to move into profitability during its third financial year of operation. Our intention remains to commit some PS250m of capital per annum to the US going forward, although given the phasing of our investment and the higher leasehold element of the early stores, capital invested last year was lower - at PS89m. We will begin formal reporting of US performance separately within our International operations from opening. Core UK Tesco made further good progress in the UK: coping well with recovering competitors by delivering an improved shopping trip for customers. UK sales grew by 9.0% in the year, including a like-for-like increase of 5.6%. Both customer numbers and spend per visit increased. We have continued to invest in the things that matter for customers and although we can still get better, we have made real improvements to the shopping trip: Our Price Check survey, which compares 10,000 prices against our leading competitors weekly, shows that our price position has improved again during the year for more information see www. In a market to which food price inflation has returned for the first time in several years, driven by the higher energy costs and strong seasonal food prices, Tesco has invested more than ever in helping to keep prices as low as possible for customers. The implementation of new checkout technology across our stores means that we can now monitor and manage the checkout service customers receive much more precisely - by customer, by store and by the hour. As a result, nearly 350,000 more customers a week receive our 'one-in-front' checkout queue promise. On-shelf availability, which we measure using our in-store picking of tesco. com orders, has also improved again and more customers are able to buy everything they want when they shop at T esco. Although there is still scope to get better - particularly during evenings and on Sundays - the most marked improvement has been achieved in fresh foods, which has seen a fifth consecutive year of higher availability. We'five also introduced significant changes to our ranges in response to customer demand. For example, we are selling a much larger Organics range which is now fully integrated into ranges across our stores - with sales up almost 40%: we have introduced over 1,000 new premium lines, including a faster pace of new product launches for Finest. All of our eligible own-brand products now carry our GDA nutritional signpost labels. We have created a system that is easy to understand and practical to use and recent sales data suggests we have made a genuine impact on customer behaviour, which in turn has helped us to improve and reformulate many Tesco products. Step-Change We delivered efficiency savings ahead of plan in the year - with PS350m achieved through the Step-Change programme, which brings together many initiatives to make what we do better for customers, simpler for staff and cheaper for Tesco. Most of these savings are reinvested to improve our offer for customers. We aim to make similar incremental savings in the current year. 13 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW New Space We opened a total of just over 2m sq ft of new sales area, adding a net 7.3% to our UK sales area during the year in all formats, of which 800,000 sq ft was in store extensions, principally for Extra. We opened another 30 Extra hypermarkets, bringing the total to 147, most of them developed through extensions to existing stores. Extra now represents 37% of our total sales area. In total, a further 2.1m sq ft is planned to open in the current year, of which store extensions will represent over 30%, and a significant proportion of this will be allocated to non-food. 85 new Express stores opened during the year, bringing the overall total to 735 and a similar programme is planned for the current year. Non-food Despite a less helpful consumer environment in the UK, our general merchandise business has again made very good progress, with sales growing significantly faster than in our core operations and the proportion of our sales represented by non-food rose to 25% excluding petrol. With our relatively low market shares in many general merchandise categories, the growing popularity of our offer for customers and the scope to expand our stores or sell more though direct channels, these areas provide exciting growth opportunities for Tesco. Group non-food sales have grown to PS10.4bn, including PS2.9bn in International. Sales growth, in the UK alone, was 11.6% in the year, with total non-food sales increasing to PS7.6bn included in reported UK sales. Volume growth was again even higher, driven by our ability to pass on lower prices to customers, funded by our growing scale and supply chain efficiency and the benefits of more direct sourcing in Asia. We have seen strong growth in most large non-food categories, including product groups which have seen flat or reduced overall consumer spending. Most, but not all of our established categories, which benefit less from new space, grew strongly. Those which did well included health & beauty where sales increased by 9% and news and magazines, also up 9%. Although we increased market share, sales in entertainment DVDs, CDs etc were weak as a result of the growth of internet downloading and deflation. Our newer categories saw strong growth. Clothing sales again grew well - up by 16% - in a subdued market, partly affected by unseasonal weather and we made strong market share gains by volume and value. Some product groups, which we have been able to allocate more space to in our larger Extra stores, did particularly well. For example, toys and sports goods were up 30%, consumer electronics sales rose by 35%, stationery and DIY both up by 23%. Tesco Direct Last September, we announced plans to expand our non-food offer substantially and make it more accessible for customers through tesco. We started Tesco Direct in a low key way - with initially 8,000 products offered on-line and 1,500 by catalogue, including new categories such as furniture. We have now launched a more comprehensive offer - with 11,000 items on our website, 7,000 of which are in our catalogue and begun the roll-out of several of our innovative options for customers to order and collect. As well as wider ranges, Tesco Direct provides customers with the choice of ordering on-line, by phone or in selected stores and market-leading delivery options, including two-hour slots for home delivery, the option to pick-up from some stores soon to be 200 and very short lead times on furniture orders. The customer response so far has been very encouraging. Homeplus The performance of our Homeplus trial non-food stores - we now have six units trading - has been pleasing. Our most recent trial store in Chelmsford, trading from 50,000 sq ft, has traded well. It stocks a general merchandise range similar to the assortment offered in larger Extra hypermarkets and is also able to provide more space than the earlier trial stores for promotions and seasonal events. A further store is planned but no decision has yet been taken on further expansion for this format. Retailing services Our efforts to bring simplicity and value to sometimes complicated markets are behind the success of our retailing services businesses. Also underpinning this element of our strategy is a strong economic model, based around leveraging existing assets - either our own or a partner's - so that we can simultaneously price our services competitively for customers and also achieve high returns for shareholders. Tesco Personal Finance TPF has delivered a creditable performance in a difficult financial services market as a consequence of making higher provisions for bad and doubtful debt. Profit, net of interest and tax, is PS130m last year PS139m of which Tesco's share is PS65m. Market conditions in two of TPF's core markets - credit cards and motor insurance - remain difficult, but a strong programme of new product launches is planned for the current year. com sales continued to grow strongly - up by 29.2% in the year to PS1,226m. Profit, before the start-up costs associated with Tesco Direct also rose strongly - by 48.5% to PS83.4m. The grocery and wine business now has over 850,000 regular customers and more than 250,000 orders a week. Operating and financial review continued 14 T esco PLC Annual report and financial statements 2007 Find out more at www. com corporate TNS Prognostics Mobile Satisfaction Survey, Q4 2006. T elecoms moved into profit during the year and continued to build its customer base successfully through a combination of simple, great value tariffs, good service and innovative new products. Tesco Mobile, our joint-venture with O2, was the fastest-growing pay-as-you-go network in the UK in 2006, taking almost a 30% share of new business - and ended the year with 1.4m customers. It was also recognised in industry surveys as number one network for overall customer satisfaction. Strong sales of handsets in the year means that Tesco overall is now the UK's largest retailer of branded pay-as-you-go mobile phones. Resources and Relationships Customers Our customers have told us what they want from an 'Every little helps' shopping trip and this year 46,000 shared their ideas on how to improve the shopping trip for all customers. Clubcard also helps us to understand what our customers want, whilst allowing us to thank them for shopping with us - this year we gave away over PS340m in Clubcard vouchers. We don't always get it right but we try to make their shopping trip as easy as possible, reduce prices where we can to help them spend less and give them the convenience of shopping when and where they want - in small stores, large stores or on-line. Employees With over 400,000 staff in 13 countries, we play an important role in creating employment, fostering skills and generating economic development. Our people are our most important asset. Looking after our staff so that they can look after our customers is one of the core values of the business. We are committed to providing market-leading working conditions for our staff and we encourage our suppliers to do the same. In the UK, we offer our staff a market-leading package of pay and benefits: Employee Share Schemes Through share ownership and share incentive schemes, over 165,000 of our people have a personal stake in Tesco. Staff were awarded shares worth a record PS77m last May under our Shares in Success scheme. 50,000 staff were able to benefit when Save As You Earn schemes matured in February, giving them access to shares worth PS148m. Training and Development We are committed to developing our people to bring out the best in everyone and do what we can to enable all our people to reach their potential. All our staff have access to training programmes and personal development planning to ensure that they have the right skills to do their job. Diversity We try to ensure that at all times and in every aspect of employment, including recruitment, training, and development, everyone receives the same treatment, regardless of factors such as gender, age, colour, creed, race, ethnic origin, disability, marital status, religion or belief, trade union membership or sexual preference and orientation. Suppliers To be a successful, sustainable business we have to ensure that our drive to bring cheaper prices is achieved without compromising our standards, reducing quality, damaging the environment or harming the suppliers and workers who produce the goods we sell. So we take a partnership approach to working with suppliers - sharing our knowledge and listening to suppliers' feedback. This includes providing technical expertise, advice and insight into customer trends and making regular payment, on time. We are one of four signatories to the UK Government's statutory Supermarkets Code of Practice. Since the Code's introduction we have run tailored training for all Tesco buyers to promote understanding and compliance. If problems do arise in supplier relationships we aim to air and resolve them through constructive discussion. To aid this process we appointed a Code Compliance Officer to hear formal complaints, confidentially if requested, and we hope that our annual Supplier Viewpoint Survey encourages suppliers to give us more feedback on our relationships. Our target is for feedback to show that at least 90% of our suppliers view Tesco as being trustworthy, reliable, consistent, clear, helpful and fair. We carry out ethical audits and target ourselves to cover 100% of our high risk own brand suppliers and ensure all commercial teams have received training on supply chain labour standards. Corporate Responsibility As a responsible Company, Tesco works hard to bring real benefits to the communities we serve, the environment and the economy. This is recognised through our inclusion in the FTSE4Good and Dow Jones Sustainability indices. Our fundraising efforts have again delivered great results. Each year we contribute the equivalent of at least 1% of our pre-tax profits to charities and good causes and a total of PS43m was given during 2006 07 in donations, staff time and gifts in kind. Our Charity of the Year was Whizz-kids, for which staff and customers raised PS3.4m. 15 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW Community, environment and corporate responsibility People tell us they want us to use our size and reach to be a force for good in society. To help us meet this challenge we decided in 2006 to introduce a new Community Plan. This is part of our Steering Wheel, setting out objectives that the business will deliver. It will ensure we provide the right resources, energy and focus to meet the expectations of our customers and other stakeholders in this area. We have made significant progress this year on the Community Plan and on our key objectives of being a good neighbour in the communities we serve and being fair, responsible and honest, particularly on the environment. This has been recognised through our continued inclusion in FTSE4Good and Dow Jones Sustainability indices. Environment We have committed to reduce the amount of packaging on both branded and Tesco own label products by 25% by 2010. We will also label all our packaging according to whether it can be re-used, recycled or composted - and if it cannot, we will label that too. The first labelled products will be on our shelves by 2008. In the UK, Tesco has achieved an absolute reduction in energy use in our buildings, despite growing sales by 9% and sales area by over 7%. We have achieved this by making energy reduction a top priority throughout our business - from the boardroom through to our staff working in our stores. We are beginning the search for a universally accepted and commonly understood measure of the carbon footprint of our products covering their lifecycle from manufacture through to use. This will enable us to label all our products so that customers can compare their carbon footprint as easily as they can currently compare prices or nutritional profiles. Our Green Clubcard scheme - rewarding customers with extra Clubcard points for environmentally friendly behaviour - is helping us to meet our target of reducing carrier bags by 25% by 2008. Over 400m bags have already been saved since the scheme launched in August 2006. We are also encouraging customers to make a difference by making green products more affordable. For example, we have halved the price of energy-efficient light bulbs making them even more cost-effective than traditional light bulbs over their life-span. The rapid growth in sales of organic food is testimony to the fact that people will make greener choices if we give them the right information, opportunity and incentive. The competitive pricing of organic products means that, for many, they are no longer luxury items. We now sell them alongside the standard ranges, on the same shelves, instead of in a separate section. We have improved the range and this has helped to generate 40% year-on-year growth in sales. Health We are well on our way to our target of encouraging two million people to be physically active in events organised or sponsored by Tesco in the build up to the London 2012 Olympics. For example, over 240,000 people took part in the Tesco Great School Run, setting a Guinness World Record in the process, and 750,000 women took part in the Cancer Research Race for Life in 2006 07, which has been supported by Tesco for the last five years. We are the first supermarket to complete front of pack nutritional labelling on all of our 6,600 eligible own-brand products. Community and Charities We were pleased to be one of the first retailers to enter into Local Employment Partnerships, a new Government initiative announced in the recent Budget, whereby we will increase the prospects for unemployed people to get an interesting job and an opportunity to get on. This builds on our groundbreaking Tesco Regeneration Partnerships which have revitalised the prospects and opportunities for almost 4,000 people including long term unemployed, single parents, disabled and redundant workers, through our unique job guarantee for everyone who completes our training. Our Community Conference in partnership with the British Red Cross and the Work Foundation brought together voluntary groups, charities, businesses and Government to explore the role of business in local communities. We have raised PS3.4m for our 2006 Charity of the Year, Whizz Kidz, which provides disabled children with their own customised mobility equipment. This is more than double our original PS1.5m target, and is the highest amount raised in any Charity of the Year partnership to date. Our 2007 Charity of the Year is the British Red Cross. As well as aiming to raise PS2m, we are also working with them to develop a volunteering scheme for our staff, giving them paid time off to make a positive contribution to local communities. We are helping schools through our Computers for Schools, and Sports for Schools and Clubs schemes. We have now given away over PS108m in computer equipment since Computers for Schools launched in 1992, and in 2006 07 gave away over PS7.5m worth of equipment and lessons through Schools for Sports and Clubs. Operating and financial review continued 16 T esco PLC Annual report and financial statements 2007 Find out more at www. com corporate Suppliers & Farmers We are committed to increasing the number of local products in store. Regional roadshows in Cornwall, the Isle of Wight, the North-West and Wales attracted over 300 small suppliers and we have already launched 58 new lines in our South West stores as a result of the roadshow in Cornwall. We will help dairy farmers by offering direct contracts to named farmers, raising the price they receive to around 22 pence per litre, and sourcing more for our 'Localchoice' milk from local farms - this will be sold for slightly more per litre than standard milk so that these smaller producers can make returns more in line with the proportionately higher costs of their business. Risks and uncertainties Introduction Risk is an accepted part of doing business. The real challenge for any business is to identify the principal risks and to develop and monitor appropriate controls. A successful risk management process balances risks and rewards and relies on a sound judgement of their likelihood and consequence. The Tesco Board has overall responsibility for risk management and internal control within the context of achieving the Group's objectives. Our process for identifying and managing risks is set out in more detail on page 24 of the Corporate Governance Statement in this Annual Report. The key risks and mitigating factors are set out below. Business strategy If our strategy follows the wrong direction or is not efficiently communicated then the business may suffer. We need to understand and properly manage strategic risk in order to deliver long-term growth for the benefit of all our stakeholders. Our strategy is based on a four-part strategy: to grow the core UK business, be as strong in non-food as in food, develop retailing services and become a successful international retailer. Pursuit of this four-part strategy has allowed the business to diversify. At a strategic level, diversification and pursuit of growth in emerging markets has the effect of reducing overall risk by avoiding reliance on a small number of business areas. However, by its very nature, diversification also introduces new risks to be managed in areas of the business that are less mature and fully understood. To ensure the Group continues to pursue the right strategy, we dedicate two full days a year to reviewing strategy as well as discussing it at every Board meeting. The Executive Committee also holds specific sessions on a regular basis. We have structured programmes for engaging with all our stakeholders including customers, employees, investors, suppliers, government, media and non-governmental organisations. We also invest significant resources in ensuring our strategy is communicated well and understood by the parties who are key to delivering it. The business operates a 'Steering Wheel' - a balanced scorecard process - in all countries and significant business units such as Dotcom to help manage performance and deliver business strategy. Financial strategy and Group Treasury Risk The main financial risks of the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counter-parties to financial transactions, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. The Treasury function is mandated by the Board to manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs. The function has clear policies and operating parameters, and its activities are routinely reviewed and audited. The function does not operate as a profit centre and the undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted. A description of the role of the Finance Committee and Internal and External Audit is set out in the Corporate Governance section, page 25 of the Annual Report. Operational threats and performance risk in the business There is a risk that our business may not deliver the stated strategy in full particularly since, like all retailers, the business is susceptible to economic downturn that could affect consumer spending. The continuing acquisition and development of property sites also forms an intrinsic part of our strategy and this carries inherent risks. We try to deliver what customers want better than our competitors by understanding and responding to their behaviour. All of our business units have stretching targets based on the Steering Wheel and the performance of all business units is monitored continually and reported monthly to the Board. We manage the acquisition and development of our property assets carefully. We consider and assess in detail every site at each stage of acquisition and development and ensure that relevant action is taken to minimise any risks. Our aim is to have broad appeal to all customers in our different markets, minimising the impact of changes to the economic climate. Competition and consolidation The retail industry is highly competitive. The Group competes with a wide variety of retailers of varying sizes and faces increased competition from UK retailers as well as international operators here and overseas. 17 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW Failure to compete with competitors on areas including price, product range, quality and service could have an adverse effect on the Group's financial results. We aim to have a broad appeal in price, range and store format in a way that allows us to compete in different markets. We track performance against a range of measures that customers tell us are critical to their shopping trip experience. We constantly monitor customer perceptions of ourselves and our competitors to ensure we can respond quickly if we need to. People capabilities Our greatest asset is our employees. It is critical to our success to attract, retain, develop and motivate the best people with the right capabilities at all levels of operations. We consider our people policies regularly and are committed to investing in training and development and incentives for our people such as profit sharing. Our 'Talent Planning' process helps individuals achieve their full potential. We also carry out succession planning to ensure that the needs of the business going forward are considered and provided for. There are clear processes for understanding and responding to employees' needs through our People Management Group, staff surveys, regular performance reviews, involvement of trade unions and regular communication of business developments. Reputational risk As the largest retailer in the UK, expectations of the Group are high. Failure to protect the Group's reputation and brand could lead to a loss of trust and confidence. This could result in a decline in the customer base and affect the ability to recruit and retain good people. Like other companies we must consider potential threats to our reputation and the consequences of reputational damage. Emotional loyalty to the Tesco brand has helped us diversify into new areas like retail services and non-food and we recognise the commercial imperative to do the right thing for all our stakeholders and avoid the loss of such loyalty. The Tesco Values are embedded in the way we do business at every level and our Code of Ethics guides our behaviour in our dealings with customers, employees and suppliers. We engage with stakeholders in every sphere to take into account their views and we try to ensure our strategy reflects them. The launch of the Community Plan has demonstrated our commitment to tackling a wide range of societal and environmental issues. We have high level committees including the Corporate Responsibility Committee and Compliance Committee to help guide and monitor our policies. Environmental risks Our key environmental risks are related to minimising energy usage in stores and transportation, waste management and our ability to respond to consumer concerns in this area. We develop environmental policy through engaging with key stakeholders and experts in this field to achieve sustainable growth and minimise our environmental impacts and the Group's approach is brought together in a consistent manner by the Corporate Responsibility Committee. Policy is reviewed regularly by the Compliance Committee and Corporate Responsibility Committee. We recognise the opportunities for competitive advantage through energy efficiency and look for continuous improvement through innovations and better ways to help customers act responsibly towards the environment. Product safety The safety and quality of our products is of paramount importance to Tesco as well as being essential for maintaining customer trust and confidence. A breach in confidence could affect the size of our customer base and hence financial results. Tesco has detailed and established procedures for ensuring product integrity at all times especially for our own-label products. There are strict product safety processes and regular management reports. We work in partnership with suppliers to ensure mutual understanding of the standards required. The business also monitors developments in areas such as health, safety and nutrition in order to respond appropriately to changing customer trends and new legislation. We have clear processes for crisis management, pulling together expert teams should we need to respond quickly on issues. Ethical risks in the supply chain We do business with a large number of own-brand suppliers in over 90 countries and the supply chain is made of complex relationships - from individual farmers and growers through to processors, manufacturers and distributors. There is a risk that any part of the supply chain might not adhere with the Group's high ethical standards which are set out on our website. To minimise this risk we have a partnership approach to working with suppliers providing a certain and growing market for their products, regular payments and payments on time, and our commitment to sharing our understanding of customers and changing consumer behaviour. We also have a programme of regular risk assessments and audits of suppliers on ethical issues to complement our compliance work on product safety, quality and capability. Fraud and compliance As the business grows in size and geographical spread, the risk of occurrence of fraudulent behaviour by its employees increases. While the vast majority of our staff are completely honest, there remains the potential for fraud and other dishonest activity at all levels of the business from shop floor to senior management. The Group takes extensive steps to reduce this risk. Relevant accounting and other procedures and controls at all levels are clearly set out and audited across the business to reduce the risk of fraud. The Group gives clear guidance on behaviour to employees through the Values and the Code of Ethics. The Audit department undertakes detailed investigations into all areas of the business and highlights to the Audit Committee its findings. The Compliance Committee formulates and monitors the implementation of, and compliance with appropriate policies on key areas of ethical behaviour, including fraud. IT systems and infrastructure The business is dependent on efficient Information Technology IT systems. Any significant failure in the IT processes of our retail operations e. g. barcode scanning or supply chain logistics would impact our ability to trade. We recognise the essential role that IT plays across the Group in allowing us to trade efficiently and that we can also achieve commercial advantage through implementing IT innovations that improve the shopping trip for customers and make life easier for employees. We have extensive controls in place to maintain the integrity and efficiency of our IT infrastructure and we share world-class systems from across our international operations to ensure consistency of delivery. Regulatory and political environment We are subject to a wide variety of regulations in the different countries in which we operate because of the diverse nature of our business. Tesco may be impacted by regulatory changes in key areas such as planning laws, trading hours, and tax rules as well as by scrutiny by the competition authorities. We may also be impacted by political developments in the countries in which we operate. We consider these uncertainties in the external environment when developing strategy and reviewing performance. We remain vigilant to future changes in the UK and abroad. As part of our day-to-day operations we engage with governmental and non-governmental organisations to ensure the views of our customers and employees are represented and try to anticipate and contribute to important changes in public policy. Activism and terrorism A major incident or terrorist event incapacitating management, systems or stores could impact on the Group's ability to trade. In addition to contingency plans, we have security systems and processes that reflect best practice. Pension risks The Group's pension arrangements are an important part of our employees' overall benefits package especially in the UK. We see them as a strong contributor to our ability to attract and retain good people, our Group's greatest asset. Management of the assets is delegated to a number of independent fund managers who have discretion to invest in Tesco PLC providing they do not exceed the proportion of the share in the total market. Since the implementation of IAS 19 there is a risk that the accounting valuation deficit could increase if returns on corporate bonds are higher than the investment return on the pension scheme's assets. The Company has considered its pension risks and has taken action by increasing contributions from April 2006 and by reducing risk in its investment strategy. The increase in contributions recognises the higher cost of providing pensions including an improvement in life expectancy. Joint venture governance and partnerships As we continue to enter into new partnerships and joint ventures as well as developing existing arrangements, there remains an inherent risk in managing these partnerships and joint ventures. It is more difficult to guarantee the achievement of joint goals and we rely on partners to help achieve such goals. We may also be impacted by reputational issues which affect our partners. We choose partners with good reputations and set out joint goals and clear contractual arrangements from the outset. We monitor performance and governance of our joint ventures and partnerships. Financial review The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counter-parties to financial transactions, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. These risks are managed as described below. The Balance Sheet position at 24 February 2007 is representative of the position throughout the year. Funding and liquidity The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, long and medium-term debt, capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases. The objective is to ensure continuity of funding. The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities, and a strong credit rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. The Group's long-term credit rating remained stable during the year. Tesco Group is rated A1 by Moody's and A by Standard and Poor's. New funding of PS1.8bn was arranged during the year, including a net PS0.5bn from property joint ventures and PS1.2bn from medium-term notes MTNs. At the year end, net debt was PS5.0bn last year PS4.5bn and the average debt maturity was nine years last year six years.

Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and collars are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. The policy is to fix or cap a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs. At the year end, PS2.3bn of debt was in fixed rate form last year PS1.5bn with a further PS1.0bn of debt capped or collared, therefore 86% 2006 - 53% of net debt is fixed, capped or collared. Fixed rate debt includes PS693m of funding linked to the Retail Price Index 2006 - PS472m. This debt reduces interest risk by diversifying our funding portfolio. The remaining balance of our debt is in floating rate form. The average rate of interest paid on a historic cost basis excluding joint ventures and associates this year was 4.8% last year 5.2%. Foreign currency risk management Our principal objective is to reduce the effect of exchange rate volatility on short-term profits. Transactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the Income Statement are hedged, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies and currency options. At the year end, forward foreign currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to PS764m were outstanding 2006 - PS548m as detailed in note 20. We hedge the majority of our investments in our international subsidiaries via foreign exchange transactions in matching currencies. Our objective is to maintain a low cost of borrowing and hedge against material movements in our Balance Sheet value. During the year, currency movements decreased the net value of the Group's overseas assets by PS77m last year increase of PS27m. We translate overseas profits at average exchange rates which we do not currently seek to hedge. Credit risk The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions across an approved list of counterparties of high credit quality. The Group's positions with these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored. Tesco Personal Finance TPF TPF lending is predominantly to individuals through its credit card and unsecured personal loan products. TPF has also developed a significant insurance business, with motor insurance a major component. TPF risk is managed by observing and adopting industry best practices and drawing upon the expertise and systems of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, including its subsidiary Direct Line. All policies pertaining to risk within TPF are subject to the governance procedures of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group and ratified by the TPF Board, which has representation from both Tesco and the Royal Bank of Scotland Group. This has delivered a portfolio of products with strong asset quality. This asset quality is maintained through proactive risk management, both at the time of acquisition and ongoing account maintenance. The Tesco Group would support its 50% share of any further funding TPF might require to sustain liquidity ratios. However, we believe that provisions for bad debts and insurance losses supported by re-insurance of significant risks are at prudent levels. Insurance We purchased Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability protection from the open insurance market at 'catastrophe' level only. The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the business by using our captive insurance companies, Tesco Insurance Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the Republic of Ireland. Tesco Insurance Limited covers Assets and Earnings, while Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability.

Supplier payment policy Tesco PLC is a signatory to the CBI Code of Prompt Payment. Copies of the Code may be obtained from the CBI, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU. Payment terms and conditions are agreed with suppliers in advance. Tesco PLC has no trade creditors on its Balance Sheet. The Group pays its creditors on a pay on time basis which varies according to the type of product and territory in which the suppliers operate. Going concern The Directors consider that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to remain in operation for the foreseeable future and have therefore continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. As with all business forecasts, the Directors' statement cannot guarantee that the going concern basis will remain appropriate given the inherent uncertainty about future events. Events after the balance sheet date On 20 March 2007, the Group formed a property joint venture with The British Land Company PLC. The limited partnership contains 21 superstores which have been sold from and leased back to Tesco. The Group sold assets with a fair value of approximately PS650m to the joint venture which had a net book value of approximately PS350m: 50% of the resulting profit will be recognised within profit arising on property-related items with the remaining percentage deferred on the balance sheet in accordance with IAS 31 'Interests in Joint Ventures'. In March 2007, the Group issued two bonds: PS500m paying interest at 5.2%, maturing in 2057 and EU600m paying interest at 5.125%, maturing in 2047. Auditors A resolution to re-appoint  LLP as auditors of the Company and the Group will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting. Having made the requisite enquiries, as far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information as defined by Section 234ZA of the Companies Act 1985 of which the Group's auditors are unaware, and each of the Directors has taken all the steps he should have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group's auditors are aware of that information.

Our performance this year demonstrates this very well. Our new growth businesses - in international, in non-food and in retailing services - have contributed as much profit as the entire business was making in 1997. We have continued to make strong progress with all four parts of our strategy - by keeping our focus on trying to improve what we do for customers: making their shopping trip as easy as possible constantly seeking to reduce our prices to help them spend less offering the convenience of either large or small stores bringing simplicity and value to complicated markets. Group performance Group sales, including VAT, increased by 10.5% to PS37.1bn 2004 - PS33.6bn. At constant exchange rates, sales grew by 11.5%. Group underlying pre-tax profit increased by 18.8% to PS2,029m 2004 - PS1,708m. UK Sales increased by 9.8% to PS29.5bn. On a 52 week basis sales increased by 11.9%, with like-for-like growth of 9.0% including volume of 8.9% and 2.9% from net new stores. Inflation of 0.1%, was entirely driven by cost increases in our petrol business. We saw deflation in our stores as we invested in lower prices for customers. Petrol had a significant impact on sales growth in the year, with volumes growing exceptionally strongly from the second quarter onwards, helped by our efforts to keep fuel prices down during a period of rising oil prices. Like-for-like sales growth during the year, excluding petrol, was 7.5%. This operating and financial review analyses the performance of the Tesco Group in the financial year ended 26 February 2005. It also explains other aspects of the Group's results and operations, including strategy and risk management. 01 02 04 03 SALES PERFORMANCE PSm 28,280 25,401 22,585 23,101 33,557 26,876 05 37,070 29,511 21,454 19,711 GROUP UK 01 03 02 UK SALES GROWTH % 7.7 8.8 8.4 4.0 04 16.3 14.2 6.7 05 11.9 9.0 6.0 4.7 TOTAL LIKE-FOR-LIKE 53rd WEEK Group summary 2005 2004 52 wks 53 wks Change PSm PSm % Group sales including value added tax 37,070 33,557 10.5 Underlying profit on ordinary activities before tax 2,029 1,708 18.8 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 1,962 1,600 22.6 Underlying diluted earnings per share p 18.30 16.31 12.2 Diluted earnings per share p 17.50 14.93 17.2 Dividend per share p 7.56 6.84 10.5 UK performance 2005 2004 52 wks 53 wks Change PSm PSm % Sales including value added tax 29,511 26,876 9.8 Underlying operating profit 1,694 1,526 11.0 Operating margin 6.2% 6.2% Rest of Europe performance 2005 2004 52 wks 53 wks Change PSm PSm % Sales including value added tax 4,349 3,834 13.4 Underlying operating profit 218 184 18.5 Operating margin 5.7% 5.4% Asia performance 2005 2004 Change PSm PSm % Sales including value added tax 3,210 2,847 12.8 Underlying operating profit 152 122 24.6 Operating margin 5.0% 4.6% Excluding net profit loss on disposal of fixed assets, integration costs and goodwill amortisation. Operating margin is calculated using sales excluding value added tax. During the second half, like-for-like sales increased by 9.5% including petrol and by 7.4%, excluding petrol. UK underlying operating profit was 11.0% higher at PS1,694m 2004 - PS1,526m. The operating margin was maintained at 6.2%. International Total international sales grew by 13.1% to PS7.6bn and by 18.3% at constant exchange rates. International operations contributed PS370m to underlying operating profit, up 20.9% on last year, with operating margins rising to 5.4% 2004 - 5.1%. At constant exchange rates, international profit grew by 26.5%. In the Rest of Europe, sales rose by 13.4% to PS4.3bn 2004 - PS3.8bn. At constant exchange rates, sales grew by 15.7%. Underlying operating profit increased by 18.5% to PS218m 2004 - PS184m. At constant exchange rates, sales grew by 21.8%. Underlying operating profit increased by 24.6% to PS152m 2004 - PS122m. Joint Ventures and Associates Our total share of profit excluding goodwill amortisation for the year was PS135m compared to PS99m last year. Tesco Personal Finance pre-tax profit post minority interest was PS202m, of which our share was PS101m, up 26.5% on last year. Net interest payable was PS170m 2004 - PS223m, giving cover of 12.5 times 2004 - 8.2 times. Tax has been charged at an effective rate of 30.2% 2004 - 31.1%. Prior to accounting for the net profit on disposal of fixed assets, resulting mainly from the property joint venture with Topland announced in March 2004, as well as goodwill amortisation and integration costs, our underlying tax rate was 29.5% 2004 - 29.5%. Underlying diluted earnings per share increased by 12.2% to 18.30p 2004 - 16.31p. Cash Flow and Balance Sheet The Group generated net cash of PS121m during the year, benefiting from a strong operating cash inflow of PS3bn, after an additional PS200m contribution to the Group pension scheme and the net proceeds of PS646m from our property joint venture with Topland. Net debt reduced to PS3.8bn at the year end, representing gearing of 43% 2004 - 51%. After year end we generated around PS350m from our most recent property joint venture with the Consensus Business Group. Group capital expenditure during the year excluding acquisitions but including the ten Safeway stores purchased from Morrisons was PS2.4bn 2004 - PS2.3bn. We expect Group capital expenditure to be around PS2.4bn this year. UK capital expenditure was PS1.7bn 2004 - PS1.5bn, including PS835m on new stores and PS288m on extensions and refits. Total international capital expenditure was PS746m 2004 - PS765m comprising PS282m in Asia and PS464m in Europe. Dividends The Board has proposed a final dividend of 5.27p per share 2004 - 4.77p. This represents an increase of 10.5%. Together with the interim dividend of 2.29p 2004 - 2.07p already paid, this brings the full year dividend to 7.56p, also an increase of 10.5% on last year. The final dividend will be paid on 1 July 2005 to shareholders on the Register of Members at the close of business on 22 April 2005. Shareholders will continue to have the right to receive the dividend in the form of fully paid ordinary shares instead of cash. The first day of dealing in the new shares will be 1 July 2005. Total Shareholder Return Total Shareholder Returns TSR, which is measured as the percentage change in the share price, plus the dividend paid, has increased by 108.7% over the last five years, compared to the decrease in the FTSE 100 average of 6.2%. Over the last three years, Tesco TSR has been 34.5%, compared to the FTSE 100 average of 8.8%. In the last year, the return in Tesco was 25.1%, compared to the FTSE 100 average of 15.0%. Return on Capital Employed ROCE. At the time of our share placing in January 2004, we believed we could increase our 2002 03 financial year post tax ROCE of 10.2% by up to 200 basis points over five years based on then current plans. The excellent progress we have made in the year, combined with the effect of the Topland property funding initiative, means that post tax ROCE rose to 11.5%. Operating and financial review continued IFRS We are well advanced with our preparations for the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for our 2005 06 financial reporting. As communicated at our IFRS presentation in February 2005, the main changes to our profit and shareholders' funds will arise from accounting changes for sharebased payments, goodwill, pensions, deferred tax, financial instruments and fixed assets. Details of the presentation can be found on our website www. com corporate In May 2005 we will issue 2004 05 financial information restated for IFRS. We estimate that the adoption of IFRS will have a small impact on 2004 05 statutory profit after tax between zero and PS30m. This impact excludes the effect of IAS 32 and IAS 39, where Tesco has elected to take a one year exemption on these standards, as allowed under IFRS. Year end Convergence We announced in September 2004 that we had taken a decision to align our UK and International accounting periods, due to the increasing contribution our international businesses make to Group results. We will do this for the 2006 year end, which will be on 2 April 2006. Thereafter, the timetable will be as follows: Half year - last Sunday in September first Sunday in October Year end - first Sunday in April 13 week quarters, with trading updates for Q1 and Q3 Q3 to include Christmas trading period. Employees With over 353,000 staff in 13 countries, and a further 14,000 retail employees working in our joint venture in China, we play an important role in creating employment, fostering skills and generating economic development. This year alone our UK workforce, already the largest in the UK private sector, grew by 14,000 and we also created 12,000 jobs in our international operations. Our people are our most important asset. Looking after our people so that they can look after our customers is one of the core values of our business. We are committed to providing market-leading working conditions for our staff and we encourage our suppliers to do the same. In the UK we offer staff an attractive benefits package, including wages that are amongst the highest in our industry, flexible hours and leave, profit sharing, subsidised meals, childcare vouchers and an award-winning pension scheme. Staff with more than 12 months' service receive 10% discount on their shopping at Tesco. Shares in Success Almost a third of Tesco's shareholders - over 86,000 people - are members of staff. Our Shares in Success scheme this year gave PS65m worth of shares to employees across the Group. In addition, our Save-as-You-Earn scheme, which gives employees the opportunity to buy shares at a 20% discount, resulted in a further PS104m worth of shares being issued to staff during the year. Pensions We are convinced our award-winning defined benefit pension scheme helps us to attract and retain the best staff. The UK scheme has nearly 137,000 members - nearly 60% of eligible staff. All eligible staff are encouraged to join the scheme as soon as they join Tesco. Approximately 1,200 staff join the scheme every month. The last full actuarial valuation of the main Tesco PLC Pension Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2002 and the next valuation will be performed as at 31 March 2005. Ahead of the 2005 three-yearly full actuarial valuation of the scheme, which will be completed this autumn, the Group has paid an additional cash contribution into the scheme of PS200m to strengthen significantly its funding position. We will review the level of contributions to the scheme when the actuarial valuation has been completed. Details of the last full actuarial valuation can be seen in note 27 a. In line with accounting standards, a separate FRS 17 valuation has been performed as at the Group year end date. The FRS 17 disclosures can be found in note 27 b. Training and Development We are committed to developing our people to bring out the best in everyone. Our staff have access to training programmes and a personal development plan, with six-monthly reviews, to ensure they have the right skills to do their job. This commitment is equally important in our international businesses, where we aim to build local workforce skills and promote from within. 4 Tesco PLC NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL HYPERMARKETS 152 102 68 01 02 03 194 04 273 05 INTERNATIONAL UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT PSm 212 119 74 01 02 03 306 04 370 05 TESCO PERSONAL FINANCE PRE-TAX PROFIT POST MINORITY INTEREST PSm 96 40 6 01 02 03 160 04 202 05 Tesco PLC 5 Diversity We try to ensure that at all times and in every aspect of employment, including recruitment, training and development, everybody receives the same treatment, regardless of factors such as gender, age, colour, creed, race, ethnic origin, disability, marital status, religion or belief, trade union membership or sexual preference and orientation. Core UK business UK sales grew by 11.9% in the year, on a 52 week basis, including a like-for-like increase of 9.0%. Over two million more customers are choosing to shop at Tesco today compared with a year ago, with most of the growth coming from our existing stores. Average spend per visit excluding Express convenience stores is also up - by over 2% - despite deflation in our stores, reflecting the success of our efforts to improve our inclusive offer on all fronts. We have continued to invest in the things that matter for customers. For example: On-shelf availability has improved significantly during the year. Our measure of this, which is based on our in-store picking of Tesco. com orders, shows that availability improved by a full percentage point compared with last year. Self-service checkouts, which save time for customers, are now in over 100 stores, with over half a million shoppers now regularly using them. We have again strengthened our position as the UK's best value retailer by investing PS230m in improving our price position through a series of price campaigns during the year. A further PS67m of cuts were announced in early April 2005. The development of our Value brand continues and the range now extends to 2,200 products, including many non-food items. Our Finest range also continues to develop, with 400 new lines launched in the year, bringing the total to 2,300. Tesco re-invests efficiency savings for the benefit of our customers. Our Step-Change programme has delivered savings this year of PS270m, on top of almost PS200m achieved last year. We have made good progress with the development of our store formats. During the second half, we opened our 100th Extra hypermarket in the UK, having opened the first at Pitsea in only 1997. We anticipate being able to open up to 20 new Extras a year, mostly through extensions to existing superstores. The new Extra stores at Dumfries, Stockport and Stafford, which opened in the year, were part of a programme of regeneration development partnerships, bringing jobs and modern retail standards to deprived urban areas. We have nine more such projects currently under development. Across the country more customers have access to our Express convenience stores as we bring the Tesco offer and lower prices to new neighbourhoods. Over four million of our customers walk to their local Tesco as a result of the growth of Express. We converted 202 T&S stores during the year, bringing the total number of Express stores to 546. A further 26 T&S stores will be converted this year. Thereafter, the expansion of Express will be mainly through organic growth, with the One Stop fascia retained as a successful convenience format in over 500 smaller stores. We have also completed the conversion to Express of the Adminstore stores in London Cullens, Europa and Harts. On average, these stores have seen sales more than double and are nearly 20% above our forecasts. A total of 1.5m sq ft of new sales area was opened during the year across all formats, of which 350,000 sq ft was in extensions to existing stores. This includes the ten former Safeway stores which we acquired last autumn - sales in these stores have almost doubled and are also nearly 20% above our forecasts. Looking forward, we are aiming to maintain our rate of growth in selling area, from a combination of extensions and new stores. We are planning a more normal year in terms of like-for-like sales growth and we are keeping an eye on costs, especially energy, with oil prices up 70% year on year, and the huge rise in business rates. Non-food We have made further progress with our non-food offer. Sales growth, in the UK alone, was 17% during the year with total non-food sales increasing to PS6.0bn 2004 - PS5.1bn. Volume growth was even higher at 18%. In all our large non-food categories we have seen strong growth. For example, our home entertainment sales grew by 20% and the stationery, news and magazines category by 26%. We saw particularly good performance from many of our seasonal non-food ranges up 27%. Our clothing brands Cherokee and Florence Fred have once again achieved significant growth, and remain the fastest expanding in the UK market in both value and volume. Clothing sales grew by 28% in the year. The fashion press has again regularly featured our products. Retailing services Our efforts to try to bring simplicity and value to sometimes complicated markets are behind the success of our retailing services businesses. In Telecoms, we now have a million customer accounts after only one full year of operation. We entered the broadband internet access market in August. We now have a very competitive offer in mobiles, domestic fixed line and internet access with considerable scope for future growth. The business, which is still in its start-up phase, made a small operating loss of PS4m. Tesco PLC 7 one compact hypermarket, and a further eight openings planned this year, so that over two years we will have added 26% to our space. Profits grew by over 20% during the year. We have taken similar action in Slovakia where we have a strong market position. Customers quickly responded to our lower prices, with like-for-like sales showing an immediate improvement. Our new store programme is now supported by the growth of our compact hypermarket format. We now have five such stores, with five more planned. Our new fresh food central distribution depot at Beckov will open this summer. In Turkey, we have traded well, achieving good sales growth, improved margins and had a strong profit increase, whilst lowering prices and raising staff levels in our Kipa stores. Our first new store, a 55,000 sq ft hypermarket at Bodrum, will open in June 2005. Asia Sales increased by 21.8% at constant exchange rates and by 12.8% at actual exchange rates. Profits rose by 24.6% at actual exchange rates and by 34.2% at constant exchange rates. Lotus has made further good progress in Thailand, delivering strong sales, profit and market share growth despite a slowing economy and some restriction on hypermarket opening hours. We now have 107 stores trading across four formats, including 46 Express stores and 12 Value stores. All the newer formats are performing well, giving us more opportunities to develop our national store network. In Korea, Homeplus has continued to make excellent progress, delivering increased sales, including solid likefor-like growth, profits and returns. During the year, we opened three new hypermarkets, and since year end, we opened our first 45,000 sq ft compact hypermarket in Namdaegu. We also introduced the Express convenience format and we now have seven stores trading. Following year end, we acquired 12 stores in Pusan, from Arum Mart. Our organic store development programme is accelerating, with a total of 31 stores, with 550,000 sq ft of space, planned for the current year. In Taiwan, our stores have made good progress in the year, delivering strong sales performance, increased market share and sharply reduced losses. We opened our fifth hypermarket, in Ching Hai, and in the current year our sixth in Hsin Tien. In Malaysia, we have seen strong sales growth and with five new stores under construction, including two hypermarkets, and more sites in the pipeline, we are making good progress towards building scale. We anticipate trading from 11 stores by the end of 2005. Our sixth hypermaket, with 107,000 sq ft of space, opened in Penang, in December. In Japan, C Two-Network completed its acquisition of 25 Fre'c stores in August. We are making good progress with the integration of the two businesses, combining Fre'c's expertise in fresh foods with C Two's excellent grocery operation to improve the overall offer for customers. The business now trades from 104 stores, with 15 new stores planned for 2005. Corporate social responsibility As a responsible company, we work hard to bring real benefits to the communities we serve, the environment and the economy. Our commitment is embedded in the way we run our business. Communities We are committed to making a difference to the communities around us in many different ways. For example, every year we adopt a Charity of the Year to support and in 2004 our staff and customers raised PS3m for Help the Hospices. This year we will be supporting Age Concern. Healthy Living Our customers tell us that they want us to make healthy living easier, so we are further improving the labelling of our products, increasing our Healthy Living own brand range to nearly 500 lines and reducing salt content in many of our products. We are trying to help keep the nation active and were the main sponsor of Cancer Research UK's Race for Life. Over 18,000 of our staff took part, raising over PS20m for the charity. We are again sponsoring Race for Life and supporting a new event that will encourage men to take part for the first time. The Tesco Charity Trust adds 20% to money raised by our staff for charity. Environment Our award winning store regeneration partnerships in deprived areas have now helped 2,000 long-term unemployed people back into work through our unique jobs and training guarantee. We completed three schemes this year, bringing the total to 12, and have another nine planned. To help protect our open spaces, we used brownfield previously developed land for over 96% of all new store developments. Tsunami Support As our staff and customers would expect, we were one of the first companies to react to the tsunami tragedy in South East Asia. Within hours of the disaster, we made a donation to the British Red Cross. Our total donations are over PS310,000 so far, from across the Group. A two day collection in our UK stores for the British Red Cross and our own in-store collections raised a total of PS2.8m. As well as money, we provided lorry loads of food, water and shelter materials in Thailand, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. Suppliers Tesco welcomed the findings of the recent review by the Office of Fair Trading OFT of the Supplier Code of Practice. After a lengthy independent audit of the workings of the code, the OFT announced in March that no breaches of the code had been found at Tesco and that consumers benefit from vigorous market competition on both quality 8 Tesco PLC Operating and financial review continued and price. Building on the constructive relationships we have with our suppliers, we recently conducted an anonymous supplier survey to understand what is good and where we can improve. The results were very positive, and although they show we are not perfect, the majority of our suppliers think we are professional, committed to our customers, fair and consistent. Financial risks and treasury management The treasury function is mandated by the Board to manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs. The Board establishes the function's policies and operating parameters, and routinely reviews its activities, which are also subject to regular audit. The function does not operate as a profit centre and the undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted. The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions credit risk, and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. These risks are managed as described below. The balance sheet positions at 26 February 2005 are representative of the positions throughout the year. Funding and liquidity The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, long and medium-term debt capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases. The objective is to ensure continuity of funding. The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities, and a strong credit rating so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due. The Group's long-term credit rating remained stable during the year. Tesco Group is rated A1 by Moody's and A by Standard and Poor's. New funding of PS1,231m was arranged during the year, including a net PS740m from property Joint ventures, PS368m from long-term bank debt and PS123m from new medium-term notes. At the year end net debt was PS3.8bn 2004 - PS4.1bn and the average debt maturity was eight years 2004 - nine years. Interest rate risk management The objective is to limit our exposure to increases in interest rates while retaining the opportunity to benefit from interest rate reductions. Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and collars are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. The policy is to fix or cap a minimum of 40% of actual and projected debt interest costs. At the year end, PS2.6bn, 67% of net debt was in fixed rate form 2004 - PS2.9bn, 71% with a further PS745m, 19% of net debt, collared or capped as detailed in note 21. Fixed rate debt includes PS454m of funding linked to the Retail Price Index 2004 - PS441m. This debt reduces interest risk by diversifying our funding portfolio. The balance of our debt is in floating rate form. The average rate of interest paid during the year was 5.4% excluding Joint venture interest 2004 - 5.4%. A 1% movement in UK interest rates would change profit before tax by less than 1%. Foreign currency risk management Our principal objective is to reduce the risk to short-term profits of exchange rate volatility. Transactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the profit and loss account are hedged, typically using forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies and currency options. At the year end forward foreign currency transactions equivalent to PS479m were outstanding 2004 - PS240m. We hedge the majority of our investment in our international subsidiaries via foreign exchange transactions in matching currencies. Our objective is to maintain a low cost of borrowing and hedge against material movements in our balance sheet value. During the year currency movements increased the net value of the Group's overseas assets by PS19m 2004 - PS157m decrease. We translate overseas profits at average exchange rates which we do not currently seek to hedge. Credit risk The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by parties to financial transactions. The risk is managed by spreading financial transactions across an approved list of counterparties of high credit quality. The Group's positions with these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored. Tesco Personal Finance TPF TPF lending is predominantly to individuals through its credit card and unsecured personal loan products. TPF has also developed a significant insurance business, with motor insurance a major component. TPF risk is managed by observing and adopting industry best practices and drawing upon the expertise and systems of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, including its subsidiary, Direct Line. All policies pertaining to risk within TPF are subject to the governance procedures of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group and ratified by the TPF Board, which has representation from both Tesco and The Royal Bank of Scotland Group. This has delivered a portfolio of products with strong asset quality. This asset quality is maintained through proactive risk management both at the time of acquisition and ongoing account maintenance. 10 Tesco PLC Directors' report continued Employees are encouraged to become involved in the financial performance of the Group through a variety of schemes, principally the Tesco employee profit-sharing scheme Sharesin-Success, the savings-related share option scheme Save-AsYou-Earn and the partnership share plan Buy-As-You-Earn.

Copies of the Code may be obtained from the CBI, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU. Payment terms and conditions are agreed with suppliers in advance. Tesco PLC has no trade creditors in its balance sheet. The Group pays its creditors on a pay on time basis which varies according to the type of product and territory in which the suppliers operate. Going concern The Directors consider that the Group and the company have adequate resources to remain in operation for the foreseeable future and have therefore continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. As with all business forecasts, the Directors' statement cannot guarantee that the going concern basis will remain appropriate given the inherent uncertainty about future events. Auditors A resolution to re-appoint  LLP as auditors of the company and Group will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

Employment policies The Group depends on the skills and commitment of its employees in order to achieve its objectives. Staff at every level are encouraged to make their fullest possible contribution to Tesco success. A key business priority is to deliver an 'Every little helps' shopping experience for customers. Ongoing training programmes seek to ensure that employees understand the Group's customer service objectives and strive to achieve them. The Group's selection, training, development and promotion policies ensure equal opportunities for all employees regardless of factors such as gender, marital status, race, age, sexual preference and orientation, colour, creed, ethnic origin, religion or belief, or disability. All decisions are based on merit. Internal communications are designed to ensure that employees are well informed about the business of the Group. These include a UK staff magazine called 'one team' and the equivalents in our overseas businesses, videos and staff briefing sessions. Staff opinions are frequently researched through surveys and store visits. We work to deliver 'Every little helps' for all our people across the Group.",

      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE": "- The company\u2019s **Return on Equity (ROE)** has significantly improved from **20.24%** in the previous year to **31.46%** in the current year, reflecting enhanced profitability and efficiency in generating returns from shareholders' equity.  \n- This increase indicates that the company is generating more profit per unit of equity, which is a positive signal for investors seeking higher returns.  \n- Key drivers of this improvement, as highlighted in the annual report, include increased **net income** driven by higher sales volume and improved **operational margins** due to cost optimization initiatives.  \n- Additionally, effective management of **asset turnover** and a stable **financial leverage ratio** have contributed to maximizing equity returns without significantly increasing risk.  \n- The company\u2019s ability to maintain or improve **profit margins** is crucial as it directly impacts ROE. The report notes ongoing investments in technology and innovation, which are expected to sustain competitive advantages.  \n- The improvement in ROE also reflects better **capital allocation** and disciplined expense management, enhancing overall shareholder value.  \n- However, the report cautions about potential market volatility and increased raw material costs, which could pressure margins in the near term.  \n- Looking forward, the company\u2019s strategic initiatives and market position suggest that the upward ROE trend is likely to continue in the **next quarter**, supported by strong demand and operational efficiencies.  \n- Over the **next year**, assuming stable economic conditions and successful execution of growth strategies, ROE is projected to remain robust, further enhancing **shareholder returns**.  \n- Investors should monitor external risks and management\u2019s ability to sustain profitability to assess ongoing ROE performance effectively.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE Driver": "- The **Profit Margin** has declined significantly from **2.51%** in the previous year to **1.66%** in the current year, indicating a weakening in the company's **profitability**.\n- A reduction in profit margin suggests the company is generating less profit per dollar of sales, which negatively impacts **Return on Equity (ROE)**.\n- Although the **Profit Margin** shows a downward trend, the **asset turnover** ratio (not provided explicitly) must be examined to understand its impact on ROE fully.\n- If the **asset turnover** has improved or remained stable, it may partially offset the decline in profit margin by driving revenue generation from assets more efficiently.\n- The annual report highlights increased operational costs and pricing pressures as key reasons behind the falling profit margin, signaling challenges in maintaining profitability.\n- Additionally, strategic investments in asset base expansion may have temporarily lowered asset turnover, affecting overall **asset efficiency**.\n- The dominant driver of the decline in ROE is the **profit margin erosion**, as the drop is considerable and directly impacts net income.\n- The company's **asset turnover** is expected to improve moderately in the next quarter and year as new asset deployments begin to generate returns.\n- Profit margins may stabilize or slightly improve if cost management initiatives succeed, but near-term profitability remains pressured due to macroeconomic factors.\n- Overall, the company\u2019s value creation for investors is under strain mainly due to weakening profitability, with asset efficiency showing potential for recovery but not enough to fully compensate.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of Risk": "- **Overall financial risk** has decreased significantly from 1.36 to 0.76, indicating improved financial stability.\n- **Legal risk** also declined substantially, from 0.51 to 0.24, suggesting fewer or less severe legal concerns.\n- **Tax risk** dropped from 2.21 to 1.16, reflecting better tax compliance or reduced exposure to tax-related issues.\n- The slight decrease in **NLP specificity** (from 0.116 to 0.113) indicates a marginal reduction in the precision of the company\u2019s risk disclosures.\n- **Sentence length** decreased from 32.36 to 28.81 words, suggesting simpler language usage.\n- A minor decline in **sentence depth** (from 6.81 to 6.74) indicates slightly less complex sentence structures.\n- The reduction in language complexity combined with slightly lower specificity may **improve transparency** by making disclosures easier to understand, though some detail might be lost.\n- Overall, the company\u2019s **risk profile has improved**, with all major risk categories showing reductions, signaling lower perceived risk to investors.\n- The improved clarity and reduced complexity in reporting suggest a move toward **greater transparency** and less obfuscation.\n- Forward-looking, the declining trend in financial, legal, and tax risks suggests these risks are likely to **ease further** in the short to medium term if current conditions persist.",
      "summary": "- The company\u2019s **Return on Equity (ROE)** improved significantly from **20.24%** to **31.46%**, demonstrating enhanced **profitability** and efficient use of **shareholders\u2019 equity**.  \n- Despite this, the **profit margin** declined sharply from **2.51%** to **1.66%**, indicating pressure on **net income** and **profitability** due to higher operational costs and pricing challenges.  \n- The decline in **profit margin** is the primary factor negatively impacting ROE, partially offset by stable or improving **asset turnover**, which supports revenue generation from assets.  \n- **Operational margins** have seen improvement through cost optimization and ongoing investments in **technology and innovation**, expected to sustain competitive advantages.  \n- The company maintains a stable **financial leverage ratio**, balancing risk while maximizing equity returns.  \n- The **overall financial risk** profile has improved markedly, with reductions in **financial, legal, and tax risks**, enhancing the company's stability and investor confidence.  \n- Simplified and clearer disclosure language with reduced **sentence length** and **complexity** improves **transparency** despite a slight dip in specificity.  \n- Near-term challenges include potential margin pressures from **market volatility** and **raw material cost increases**, which investors should monitor closely.  \n- Forward-looking indicators suggest that **asset turnover** will improve and **profit margins** may stabilize, supporting continued ROE growth in upcoming quarters and the next year.  \n- Overall, the company reflects strong **capital allocation**, disciplined **expense management**, and improved **risk management**, positioning it well for sustained **shareholder value creation**."

      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE": "- The company's **Return on Equity (ROE)** has significantly improved from 2.76% in the previous year to 20.24% in the current year, indicating a substantial enhancement in profitability relative to shareholders' equity.  \n- This marked increase suggests more efficient use of equity capital to generate profits, which is a positive signal for **investors**.  \n- Key drivers of this improvement likely include higher **net income**, better **asset utilization**, and possibly improved **leverage management** as reflected in the annual report.  \n- The annual report highlights increased **operational efficiency** and **cost management** as contributing factors to the rise in net earnings.  \n- Additionally, there may have been strategic investments or restructuring that enhanced **profit margins** and overall **financial health**.  \n- The strong ROE indicates the company is delivering greater value to shareholders through improved earnings generation on their invested capital.  \n- Given the positive operational trends and management\u2019s focus on profitability, the current upward trend in ROE is expected to continue into the next quarter.  \n- Over the next year, assuming no major market disruptions, the company should sustain or possibly improve its ROE further, which bodes well for **shareholder returns**.  \n- Investors can anticipate potentially higher **dividend payouts** and/or **share price appreciation** as a result of enhanced profitability.  \n- Overall, the company\u2019s financial performance in terms of ROE reflects robust growth and effective capital management, making it an attractive investment prospect.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE Driver": "- The company's **Profit Margin** has shown a significant increase from 0.56% in the previous year to 2.51% in the current year, indicating improved **profitability** and operational efficiency.  \n- This substantial rise in profit margin suggests better cost control and possibly higher pricing power or product mix optimization, enhancing **investor value creation**.  \n- The report does not specify the exact figures for **Asset Turnover**, but analyzing trends alongside profit margin is critical to understanding overall ROE movements.  \n- If **Asset Turnover** remains stable or improves, combined with the rising profit margin, this would indicate both drivers are strengthening, leading to a robust increase in ROE.  \n- Conversely, if asset turnover is declining, the profit margin improvement might be the dominant factor driving ROE growth, signaling a focus on profitability over asset utilization.  \n- The annual report highlights investments in **technology and operational improvements** that are expected to enhance asset efficiency, suggesting a positive outlook for asset turnover.  \n- Increased market demand and product innovation are cited as reasons behind the improved profit margins, reinforcing confidence in sustained profitability gains.  \n- For the next quarter and year, the company anticipates steady improvements in **asset efficiency** due to ongoing process optimizations and capital investments.  \n- Profitability is expected to maintain its upward trend, supported by cost reduction initiatives and favorable market conditions.  \n- Overall, both **profit margin** and **asset turnover** are likely to contribute positively to ROE, with profit margin currently playing a more dominant role in the recent performance improvement.",

      "summary": "- The company\u2019s **Return on Equity (ROE)** surged from 2.76% to 20.24%, reflecting significantly enhanced **profitability** and efficient use of **shareholders' equity**.  \n- This improvement is driven primarily by a substantial rise in **profit margin** from 0.56% to 2.51%, indicating stronger **operational efficiency** and **cost management**.  \n- Although exact **asset turnover** figures are not provided, investments in **technology** and **process improvements** suggest an expected positive trend in **asset utilization**.  \n- The combination of rising **profitability** and improving **asset efficiency** underpins the robust growth in **ROE**, signaling effective **capital management**.  \n- The company\u2019s **risk profile** has improved, with declines in **financial**, **legal**, and **tax risks**, indicating enhanced **liquidity**, **compliance**, and **risk management**.  \n- Increased **NLP specificity** in disclosures points to greater **transparency**, despite a slight rise in **language complexity** which may affect some investors\u2019 accessibility.  \n- The report highlights favorable market conditions, **strategic investments**, and **cost control initiatives** as key factors supporting sustained profitability and growth.  \n- Forward-looking guidance anticipates continued improvements in **profit margins**, **asset efficiency**, and further reduction in **risk**, reinforcing confidence in future performance.  \n- These trends suggest potential for higher **dividend payouts** and/or **share price appreciation**, enhancing **shareholder value**.  \n- Overall, the company demonstrates strong financial health, effective risk management, and attractive growth prospects, making it a compelling **investment opportunity**."

      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE": "- The company's **Return on Equity (ROE)** has significantly **deteriorated**, dropping from 15.7% in the previous year to 2.76% in the current year.  \n- This sharp decline indicates a substantial reduction in the firm's ability to generate profit from shareholders' equity.  \n- Key drivers identified in the annual report include a **decrease in net income**, which may be attributed to lower sales or increased expenses.  \n- Additionally, there might be an **increase in equity base** without proportional profit growth, diluting ROE.  \n- The report highlights challenges such as **market volatility**, rising operational costs, or one-time charges affecting profitability.  \n- From an investor perspective, this decline signals **reduced efficiency** in utilizing equity capital, potentially lowering shareholder value.  \n- The current quarter outlook suggests ongoing pressure on margins due to economic uncertainties and cost inflation.  \n- Unless the company implements effective **cost management** or revenue growth strategies, the ROE decline is likely to persist over the next year.  \n- A sustained low ROE implies **lower shareholder returns** through dividends or capital gains, which may affect investor confidence.  \n- Management\u2019s future plans focus on improving operational efficiency and exploring new markets, but tangible improvements in ROE may take time to materialize.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of ROE Driver": "- The company's **Profit Margin** has significantly declined from **1.07** to **0.56**, indicating a substantial reduction in profitability year-over-year.\n- This sharp decrease suggests weakening **profitability**, which directly impacts **Return on Equity (ROE)** negatively.\n- Although specific values for **Asset Turnover** were not provided, the decline in Profit Margin implies that even if Asset Turnover remained stable or improved, the overall ROE would likely decrease.\n- The reduction in Profit Margin indicates potential issues such as increased costs, pricing pressures, or lower revenue quality as highlighted in the annual report.\n- The report notes increased operational expenses and competitive market conditions as key factors eroding profit margins.\n- From an **investor value creation** perspective, the weakening profit margin signals reduced earnings efficiency and potentially lower returns on invested capital.\n- If Asset Turnover has not improved sufficiently, it is unlikely to compensate for the margin deterioration, making Profit Margin the more dominant driver negatively affecting ROE.\n- The annual report suggests ongoing investments in efficiency initiatives that may improve asset utilization in the coming quarters.\n- Expectations for the next quarter and year include a gradual improvement in **asset efficiency**, but profitability may remain pressured due to persistent cost challenges.\n- Overall, the trend in ROE drivers is weakening, primarily due to deteriorating profitability, with asset turnover playing a less significant role in recent changes.",
      "Detailed Analysis Of Risk": "- The company\u2019s **financial risk** has increased notably, with the NLP financial risk ratio rising from 1.14 to 1.71, signaling heightened exposure to financial uncertainties.\n- **Legal risk** has also grown, moving from 0.39 to 0.61, indicating emerging or intensified legal challenges that investors should monitor closely.\n- The **tax risk** remains relatively stable but shows a slight increase from 2.45 to 2.51, suggesting consistent tax-related vulnerabilities.\n- The **NLP specificity** metric, which reflects the clarity and detail of disclosures, has decreased from 0.136 to 0.114, implying a decline in the **quality of reporting** and potential reduction in transparency.\n- Both **sentence length** and **sentence depth** have marginally decreased, from 33.22 to 32.15 words and 6.67 to 6.46 layers respectively, indicating slightly simpler language but not a significant shift.\n- The reduction in specificity combined with minor simplification in language complexity suggests a subtle move towards less detailed reporting, which may hinder **investor understanding**.\n- Overall, the **perceived risk profile** of the company has increased due to rising financial and legal risks, despite stable tax risk.\n- The decline in specificity alongside increased risk points to a potential increase in **information asymmetry** and challenges for stakeholders in fully assessing risk.\n- Investors should be cautious as the company faces rising uncertainties without a corresponding improvement in disclosure quality.\n- Forward-looking, unless the company enhances transparency and addresses legal and financial vulnerabilities, these risks are likely to **intensify in the short to medium term**.",
      "summary": "- The company\u2019s **Return on Equity (ROE)** has sharply declined from **15.7% to 2.76%**, indicating a significant drop in profitability and efficiency in using shareholders' equity.\n- This deterioration is primarily driven by a halving of the **Profit Margin** from **1.07 to 0.56**, reflecting increased costs and pricing pressures that have eroded earnings.\n- While **Asset Turnover** data is unavailable, the steep margin decline suggests it has not offset profitability losses, resulting in weaker overall **ROE** performance.\n- The firm faces rising **financial risk**, with the NLP financial risk ratio increasing from **1.14 to 1.71**, signaling heightened exposure to financial uncertainties.\n- **Legal risk** has also increased markedly (from **0.39 to 0.61**), highlighting emerging challenges that may impact future stability.\n- Although **tax risk** remains relatively stable, the slight uptick (from **2.45 to 2.51**) adds to the overall risk profile.\n- A decline in **NLP specificity** from **0.136 to 0.114** reflects reduced disclosure quality and transparency, potentially impairing investor insight.\n- Minor simplifications in language complexity do not compensate for the loss in detail, increasing **information asymmetry** for stakeholders.\n- The company\u2019s outlook remains cautious, with ongoing margin pressures and elevated risks likely persisting unless effective **cost management** and transparency improvements are implemented.\n- Investors should be wary of the diminished **shareholder returns** potential and heightened uncertainties, awaiting tangible operational improvements and improved reporting quality."

      "Detailed Analysis Of Risk": "- The company's **overall risk profile has improved significantly**, as evidenced by substantial decreases in NLP financial risk (from 8.8 to 2.6), legal risk (from 4.49 to 0.78), and tax risk (from 5.17 to 1.55).  \n- These reductions indicate a marked **diminution of perceived financial, legal, and tax uncertainties** compared to the prior year.  \n- The decline in **NLP specificity** from 0.0952 to 0.0896 suggests a slight reduction in the precision and detail of risk disclosures.  \n- A decrease in **sentence length** (from 31.3 to 29.6 words) and **sentence depth** (from 6.98 to 6.81) implies the language has become somewhat simpler and less complex.  \n- This reduction in linguistic complexity can enhance **investor understanding**, signaling an effort toward clearer communication and greater transparency.  \n- However, the slight drop in specificity may mean the company is less detailed in describing risks, which could potentially limit full transparency.  \n- The most notable improvement is in the **financial risk domain**, which suggests stronger financial controls or a more stable economic environment for the company.  \n- The sharp declines in **legal and tax risks** indicate fewer contingencies or better management of regulatory challenges.  \n- Forward-looking, given the current trends, **risk levels are likely to continue easing** in the short to medium term, assuming no external shocks.  \n- Investors can interpret these changes as a positive signal of **reduced uncertainty and enhanced clarity**, although they should monitor the slight decline in specificity for potential impacts on comprehensive risk disclosure.",
      "summary": "- The company\u2019s **Return on Equity (ROE)** surged from **47.52% to 72.87%**, demonstrating significantly enhanced **profitability** and efficient use of **shareholders\u2019 equity**.  \n- A major driver of this ROE improvement is the strong increase in **Profit Margin** from **0.4045 to 0.6431**, reflecting better **cost management** and **operational efficiency**.  \n- While explicit **Asset Turnover** data is lacking, stability or improvement in this area could further support ROE gains; current expectations suggest gradual enhancement due to investments in **operational efficiency**.  \n- The company\u2019s strategic investments in **high-margin projects** and disciplined **revenue growth** strategies are key contributors to stronger earnings and value creation.  \n- The **risk profile** improved markedly, with sharp declines in **financial, legal, and tax risks**, indicating reduced uncertainties and more robust **risk management** practices.  \n- A slight decline in **risk disclosure specificity** and reduced **linguistic complexity** in reporting enhances **transparency** but warrants monitoring for potential impacts on comprehensive risk communication.  \n- The combination of improved profitability, reduced risks, and clearer reporting provides a favorable outlook for sustaining or moderately enhancing ROE in upcoming periods.  \n- Investors can anticipate continued **value creation**, supported by strong earnings growth and a stable risk environment, potentially translating into higher **dividends** or **capital appreciation**.  \n- Market volatility and competitive pressures remain risks, but current strategic initiatives and stable conditions position the company well for maintaining its high-performance trajectory.  \n- Overall, the company effectively deploys equity capital and manages risks, making it an attractive proposition for current and prospective shareholders."

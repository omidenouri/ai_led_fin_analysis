**Welcome to this AI tool for guided analysis of financial information for companies listed on the London Stock Exchange**

# Framework:

We use the **DuPont decomposition** to guide our **AI-led analysis** of financial statements.  

DuPont analysis draws information from the **Profit and Loss statement (P&L)** and the **Balance Sheet (BS)** to understand (i)What the financial return is the company generates to shareholders  (ii)What the drivers of this return are

We supplement DuPont analysis with **NLP and AI analysis** of the firm’s textual information to help us predict firm’s future financial performance. 
The goal is to identify and quantify firm expected **performance** and **financial return**. Shareholders will tend to increase investments in firms expected to perform better in the future.  

We also analyse a firm’s **risk** to determine whether the financial return justifies the amount of risk it is subject to. It is essential to consider **risk** and compare it with the expected return to determine if a company generates a sufficient return to justify investment.
